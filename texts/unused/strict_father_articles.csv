"President Trump and first lady Melania Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16. (www.kremlin.ru)

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is over, and the results could not be more of a relief for President Donald Trump: no collusion with the Russian government and not enough evidence for an obstruction of justice charge. It was unquestionably good news for the president and for Republicans on Capitol Hill who have lashed their own political futures to Trump.

The report is also a plus for the country -- not only because Washington won't be consumed with a constitutional crisis anytime soon, but also because it provides the Trump administration with its first opportunity to settle on a Russia policy without the risk of an extreme political backlash.

U.S.-Russia relations were already in the tank before Trump was sworn into office. Russian President Vladimir Putin's return to the Kremlin after a four-year hiatus as prime minister was like a wet blanket over the fire of an otherwise productive detente between the two former Cold War adversaries. Putin took what had been a relatively productive period with the Americans (deals had been struck on a variety of issues, including New START, the use of Russian air routes into Afghanistan, counterterrorism cooperation, ever-stronger U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran) into a deep freeze in less than a year. Russia's annexation of Crimea, military support to separatists in Eastern Ukraine, campaign on behalf of the Assad regime in Syria, and interference in European politics all contributed to the unhealthy discourse. Putin's active measures operation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election reaffirmed what so many officials in Washington already believed: Putin is out to attack American democracy and challenge the U.S. in multiple theaters.

Trump's desire to get along with Putin was not a bad idea at its core. Russia may be a weakling compared to its Soviet ancestor (its GDP is about $400 billion less than recession-threatened Italy), but it remains a major power in Eurasia. Moscow has demonstrated on three separate occasions over the last decade -- Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014, and Syria in 2015 -- that it's willing to use military force when its interests are threatened. Of course, Russia is also the world's largest nuclear power, with thousands of nuclear warheads in its arsenal. Nobody, not even John Bolton, would suggest that getting into a military confrontation with Russia is smart.

Yet for as long as the Mueller investigation has hovered over the White House, Trump has been unable to chart a course towards a more constructive relationship with Moscow. With collusion never far from anybody's lips and Washington enveloped in ever more hysterical anti-Russia sentiment, getting close to Moscow in any way was risky politics. Senator Rand Paul found this out the hard way when his attempt to lift travel restrictions on Russian lawmakers for the most innocent of reasons -- to encourage a dialogue between Russian MPs and members of Congress -- was immediately dismissed. It was much more politically expedient to keep the sanctions bills coming; whether they consisted of mandatory reporting on the assets of Russian oligarchs or a prohibition on buying Russian debt were not as important as continuing the deluge. Why would any politician try to find friendly avenues with Moscow when the politics stank?

During the Mueller investigation, Trump couldn't take a meeting with a senior Russian official without hearing every pundit on TV speculate feverishly about the sinister nature of it all. The president, true to form, only fueled the collusion conspiracy through his own actions. Whether it was calling Jim Comey a ""nutjob"" to Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov or the public taking Putin's side over the U.S. intelligence community on the issue of election interference, he only complicated his own path towards better engagement with Russia.

No politician wanted to be framed as empathetic to Putin's evil genius or attacked as a na√Øf who didn't understand what Moscow was doing. The politics of Russia were too hot for most people to touch -- especially the president, who was under the watchful eye of the most famous lawman in the country.

The fight over the Mueller report will go on, this time over how much to disclose to the public and whether Attorney General William Barr made the correct decision in not filing an obstruction charge.

But with the investigation complete, the report submitted, and the conclusions made, the Trump administration may now have a chance to at least explore whether the Russians are open to collaboration on fair terms.

Politics in Washington can often guide policy. The question post-Mueller is whether policy will now be front of mind.",0,The American Conservative,"With Mueller Done, Now is the Time for Better Relations With Russia"
"This is a thing. This is a thing that actually happened today:

Actor Jussie Smollett's attorney suggested the Osundairo brothers, two Nigerian men who claim Smollett hired them to stage a hate crime, may have been wearing ""whiteface"" during the incident.

Attorney Tina Glandian, who appeared n NBC's Today show this morning, pushed the theory after being asked about Smollett's claim that he was attacked by a white man.

""He only saw one of the attackers. One of them he didn't see. He saw one through a ski mask,"" Glandian said. ""Again, he could not see their body. Everything was covered, and he had a full ski mask on except the area around the eyes.""

""He did tell police that he -- from what we saw, he thought it was pale skin or white or pale skin, was I think what he said,"" she added. ""And that was what he -- and that's why he initially did have a hard time.""

Glandian continued by suggesting Osundairo brothers had worn whiteface in the past -- during a skit as The Joker from Batman in clown makeup -- and may have done it again:

""Well, you know, I mean, I think there's -- obviously, you can disguise that. You can put makeup on. There is, interestingly enough, a video. You know, I think police had minimal investigation in this case, it took me only five minutes to Google. You know, I was looking up the brothers, and one of the videos that showed up actually was of the brothers in whiteface doing a joker monologue with white makeup on him. So, it's not -- it's not implausible.""

[Insert O.J. Simpson ""find the real killer"" joke here.]

You should read Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass, who is having a ball beating up on corrupt Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx over her spectacularly awful handling of the Smollett case. Here's his first column. Excerpt:

You might say Foxx bathed [Smollett] in the waters of the Chicago Way, cleansed him, and made a new man out of him.

And now he's smirking at the city, the mayor, the cops, everyone. Can't wait until he files that multimillion-dollar lawsuit.

""Foxx expunged it all,"" said a top Chicago police official. ""The media's really not focusing on that. What does it mean? It means you'll never see the (police) interviews or read the notes.

""The case has been expunged. I can't even tell you if Jussie Smollett was ever arrested or charged,"" the official said. ""Charged with what? Faking hate crimes? Indictments, what indictments? She wiped him clean.""

Foxx isn't saying much. She hasn't said much at all since it was learned that she'd been contacted about Smollett by lawyer Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama's former chief of staff.

Tchen reportedly wanted Foxx's help to lobby the Chicago Police Department and police Superintendent, Eddie Johnson. It didn't work.

Foxx was out over her skis on that one, completely out of her depth. She was compromised and was compelled to recuse herself in the case.

From today's Kass column, in which he makes fun of an e-mail Foxx sent out to her office seeking help on quieting the outrage over the big favor she did for Smollett:

And then came that panicky email Foxx's office sent out, asking prosecutors for ""examples of cases, felony preferable, where we, in exercising our discretion, have entered into verbal agreements with defense attorneys to dismiss charges against an offender if certain conditions were met, such as the payment of restitution, completion of community service, etc. but the defendant was not placed in a formal diversion program.""

In other words: Please help me. I've screwed up, and I need examples to show people that what I did is really not all that unusual.

I asked a Cook County judge about this.

""How stupid is it to put in writing that you're advertising for excuses after the fact?"" said the judge.

No further questions, Your Honor.

Today Foxx's office admits that she lied to the public about recusing herself from the case over her prior conversations with Smollett family members over Jussie.

https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js

And in today's Chicago Sun-Times, Foxx concedes that there was enough evidence against Smollett to convict him for having faked a hate crime, and that they would have gotten that conviction. Really, she says that! Her office allowed a man it believed was guilty of 17 felonies (staging the hate crime, and then lying to police about it), and would have been convicted of those felonies at trial, to walk away from having to answer for them in court. Foxx says, presumably with a straight face, that her office -- remember, she's claiming that she had nothing to do with this -- chose to treat Smollett's case like one of the ""alternative prosecutions"" it has pursued with low-level nonviolent offenders.

That's a weak excuse:

Smollett likely wouldn't have gone to jail, but the way his case was concluded was different from ""alternative prosecutions"" typically pursued in Cook County, said Richard Kling, an IIT-Kent Law School professor with a large roster of clients facing charges in the same courthouse where Smollett had held his triumphant press conference Tuesday. Deferred prosecutions or pre-trial diversion programs typically require some admission of guilt, a formal arrangement for community service hours and a period of probation before charges or dropped and a record can be expunged.

""In my 48 years of practice, I certainly have never seen a deferred prosecution done like that,"" Kling said.

Because all the records have been sealed and expunged, we may never know why Jussie Smollett got such favorable treatment. Because there was not even an admission of guilt from Smollett, he and his lawyers are now going around claiming that he was telling the truth all along, and that Smollett really was assaulted by some MAGA strangers who may have been white, or may have been black men in whiteface. Who knows how long he's going to drag out these lies?

I think this is mostly a case about celebrity and power, but given the details here, it is unavoidably about race. Smollett made widely reported allegations that he was beaten by white men who claimed to be Trump supporters punishing him for being black and gay. It became a national news story, with top politicians sounding off about it (e.g., Sen. Kamala Harris called it a ""modern-day lynching."") The story was always implausible, but as the investigation continued, police found damning evidence showing that Smollett probably orchestrated the entire thing, most likely to boost his career.

If Smollett did this, then he exploited racial and political tension for the sake of increasing his fame, stirring up race hatred to get a bigger paycheck. This is a horrible thing. He should have been tried for it, and if found guilty, then at least forced to pay back the city for the cost of the investigation.

Instead, thanks to Kim Foxx -- who believes he is guilty, and that her prosecutors could have proved that to a jury's satisfaction in court -- race-baiter Jussie Smollett walked away a free man, all the evidence against him chucked into a memory hole, as Foxx's office wanted. Foxx didn't even get an admission of guilt out of this dirtbag Smollett! (Here is a Q&A explainer about the case, with lots of details.)

Some independent Chicago bloggers found a bunch of people in Chicago who had, or have, charges like Smollett's, who were treated very differently by the State's Attorney's office. None of them are celebrities. None of them had Obama connections.

So, let's recap:

Why? I had thought that the prospect of the FBI looking into this case was an imprudent idea, but now I'm wondering what, exactly, Kim Foxx is hiding.

The Smollett family is well connected in black movement circles. According to a New York Times profile of Jussie and sister Jurnee from 2016:

The Smolletts have also been outspoken politically and, since their school years, devoted to causes like H.I.V./AIDS prevention and ending apartheid. They were raised in the orbit of the Black Panthers and, lately, have lent their voices to the Black Lives Matter movement. Their trajectory, from child stars to successful adults, is born of their family and its history of activism.

""Their sense of justice is very strong, and it permeates everything that they do,"" said Alfre Woodard, who has known Jussie and Jurnee since they were children; they worked with her at the nonprofit Artists for a New South Africa. ""They're like a model sibling unit. They look out for each other, all the time. And they all reach across and say, 'O.K., I got my foot in this door; here, grab my hand, we're going in together.'""

Raised on a diet of classic films (they'll gladly quote the 1945 version of ""Mildred Pierce""), Jussie and Jurnee still count their mother, Janet Smollett, as their only acting coach. An African-American from New Orleans, Ms. Smollett met their father, Joel Smollett Sr., a Russian-Polish Jew, in the Bay Area, where they campaigned for civil rights. ""My mom was in the movement with Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, and one of her first mentors was Julian Bond,"" Mr. Smollett said of the Black Panther founders and the civil rights leader. ""To this day, Angela Davis is one of her dearest friends. We've spent Mother's Day with Angela.""

Angela Davis, you'll recall, was (and I believe still is) a communist. In 2014, she sent fraternal greetings to the Communist Party USA at its convention, pledging solidarity and saying that socialism ""is our only hope."" The Smollett family have been involved in radical class and race politics for a long time. Did they call in favors among black radical elites, who might have pressured Kim Foxx? Is this the activist community protecting the fortunate son of one of its own?

This is all potent stuff in the age of populism. Now all we need to find out is that Jussie is headed to Stanford for a master's degree.",1,The American Conservative,Kim Foxx & The Fortunate Son
"Avengers: Endgame star Chris Evans is making plans to launch a new political website along with Joe Kiani, an entrepreneur and mega-donor to former President Obama's presidential campaign.

In a profile piece published in The Hollywood Reporter, Chris Evans, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks politics and using his voice to speak out about issues he cares about. Among other things, the Disney star calls President Donald Trump a ""dumb shit"" and says that he's willing to lose half his audience over his left-wing political views.

Perhaps the most interesting buried lede from the THR piece is the fact that he plans to start a political website called ""A Starting Point,"" which is, according to the Reporter, dedicated to creating ""informed, responsible and empathetic citizens.""

The two co-founders for this website are even more interesting.

First, there is Joe Kiani, an entrepreneur in the medical field who's also spent years cutting big checks to Democrats.

According to the campaign finance website Open Secrets, Kiani was a bundler for Barack Obama's re-election efforts in 2012, directing a minimum of $500,000 to his campaign. In 2017, Kiani donated another whopping amount to the Obama Foundation. According to the Chicago Tribune, he gave ""in the range of $500,000 to $750,000.""

Kiani has connections to the Clinton family as well. According to Clinton Foundation documents, Kiani paid over $100,000 for a meeting with Bill Clinton. As Breitbart News reported in 2016, Kiani paid $140,000 for a ""Meeting with WJC"" (William Jefferson Clinton).

The other co-founder, Hollywood actor and producer Mark Kassen, is a friend of Kiani's.

Kiani serves on the board of Kassen's production company, Like Minded Entertainment (LME). In 2017, THR reported that LME created a ""360-degree and VR live stream of President Barack Obama's final speech in office from Chicago, produced with VantageVR and VR Scout.""",2,Breitbart,Anti-Trump Actor Chris Evans Prepping Political Website with Obama Mega-Donor Joe Kiani

BETO BOUNCES INTO THE TOP TIER

Quinnipiac University: ""In an early look at the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, former Vice President Joseph Biden is the choice of 29 percent of Democrats and voters leaning Democratic, with 19 percent for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and 12 percent for former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has 8 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners, the independent Quinnipiac University National Poll finds. ... Democrats and Democratic leaners say 70 - 27 percent that age is not an important factor in their vote. Looking at other possible factors, these voters say: 72 - 21 percent that political ideology is an important factor; 67 - 23 percent that bipartisanship is an important factor; 71 - 24 percent that standing up to Republicans is important... It is more important that a presidential candidate be a great leader, 55 percent of all voters say, while 36 percent say it's more important for a candidate to have great policy ideas.""

Buttigieg picking up steam - Fox News: ""A new national poll provides more evidence that White House contenders Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Pete Buttigieg of Indiana are on the rise in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. ... Buttigieg comes in at 4 percent in the survey, several slots behind the leaders but still representing a pickup in the polls. The South Bend, Indiana mayor and Afghanistan War veteran was considered an extreme long shot for the nomination when he launched his presidential exploratory committee in January. But he's seen his star rise in recent weeks, attracting larger crowds on the campaign trail and plenty of positive coverage on the cable news networks and political media.""

He's booming in Iowa, too - Focus on Rural America: ""Joe Biden, Beto O'Rourke and Amy Klobuchar have each fallen between 4% and 5% since December. As a new entrant, Pete Buttigieg, is now tied for 6th place at 6%. Democratic caucus goers are paying much more attention to the contest now, compared to last December, and have strongly positive views of many of the contenders. Name recognition of many candidates has increased substantially in the last three months. Several candidates have also show significant increases in the proportion of voters who hold positive opinions about them, with at least a 10% increase in positive opinion seen by Cory Booker, Julian Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper, and Amy Klobuchar. Pete Buttigieg, not asked about in the December survey, also shows significant positive opinion at 44%.

Klobuchar announces $1 trillion infrastructure plan - AP: ""Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar is pitching an infrastructure plan she says will provide $1 trillion to fix roads and bridges, protect against flooding and rebuild schools, airports and other projects. The plan announced Thursday is the first policy proposal from the Minnesota senator since she joined the 2020 race with a snowy rally not far from where the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River in 2007. Klobuchar speaks often on the campaign trail about the collapse, which killed 13 people, telling voters 'a bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle of America.' The plan calls for leveraging $650 billion in federal funding through public-private partnerships, bond programs and clean-energy tax incentives. It would restart the Build America Bonds program President Barack Obama's administration created to help stimulate the economy during the recession.""

Warren's next target: Agribusiness - Des Moines Register: ""Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is taking aim at some of the nation's largest agribusiness companies, such as Tyson and Bayer-Monsanto, continuing her campaign's assault on corporate consolidation. The Democratic presidential candidate's plan, released exclusively to the Des Moines Register before it was unveiled Wednesday, would address consolidation in the agribusiness industry, 'un-rig' the rules she says favor its largest players, and elevate the interests of family farmers. ... Warren has not shied away from confronting those affected by her policies, delivering them directly to those industries' doorsteps. Just as she announced her plan to break apart the nation's largest tech companies before heading to one of the industry's largest gatherings, Warren is announcing her plan to take on corporate agriculture days before traveling to Iowa to speak at a rural issues forum.""

L.A. Mayor says California is still up for grabs - Bloomberg: ""Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Democratic U.S. Senator Kamala Harris has strong support for her presidential bid in her home state of California, but she doesn't have it locked up as her competitors aggressively campaign there. 'Everybody's been here,' Garcetti said in an interview, citing visits by Democratic candidates including New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, whose rally on Saturday in front of the Los Angeles City Hall drew thousands of supporters. 'California will very much be in play.'""

If you can do it from South Bend, why not Miramar, Fla.? - Miami Herald: ""South Florida Mayor Wayne Messam announced that he's running for president Thursday by releasing what may be the most meta campaign video of the young 2020 presidential cycle. Messam, the 44-year-old mayor of Miramar, dropped a two-minute biographical video intended to introduce the former Florida State Seminole wide receiver to the country. It begins with a wide-angle shot of Messam -- an avid runner who grew up the son of a contract sugar cane cutter in a rural Lake Okeechobee town -- running on a road along a cane field. 'The promise of America belongs to all of us,' Messam says. 'That's why I'm going to be running for president.'""

THE RULEBOOK: THANK U, NEXT

""The natural cure for an ill-administration, in a popular or representative constitution, is a change of men. A guaranty by the national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and sedition in the community."" - Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21

TIME OUT: 'BACK IN THE COUNTRY DAYS'

Since it is opening day for big league baseball, we offer a little meditation from ""The Summer Game"" the book by greatest baseball writer of them all, Roger Angell. ""Within the ballpark, time moves differently, marked by no clock except the events of the game. This is the unique, unchangeable feature of baseball, and perhaps explains why this sport, for all the enormous changes it has undergone in the past decade or two, remains somehow rustic, unviolent, and introspective. Baseball's time is seamless and invisible, a bubble within which players move at exactly the same pace and rhythms as all their predecessors. This is the way the game was played in our youth and in our fathers' youth, and even back then - back in the country days - there must have been the same feeling that time could be stopped. Since baseball time is measured only in outs, all you have to do is succeed utterly; keep hitting, keep the rally alive, and you have defeated time. You remain forever young. Sitting in the stands, we sense this, if only dimly. The players below us - Mays, DiMaggio, Ruth, Snodgrass - swim and blur in memory, the ball floats over to Terry Turner, and the end of this game may never come.""

HOUSE DEMS WEIGH SUBPEONA ON MUELLER REPORT

WaPo: ""Attorney General William P. Barr is expected to miss House Democrats' deadline to provide Congress the full report documenting special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, increasing the likelihood lawmakers will subpoena the Justice Department. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that during a Wednesday phone call with Barr, the attorney general said it would be 'weeks, not months' before lawmakers can see the report, making it 'apparent that the department will not meet the April 2 deadline that we set' earlier this week. Barr would not promise that 'an unredacted full report with the underlying documents, evidence, would be provided to Congress and to the American people,' Nadler said. 'We're not happy about that, to put it mildly.' Though Nadler would not say whether lawmakers will issue a subpoena, he told reporters that April 2 was 'a hard deadline that we set and we mean it.' A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""

'The resistance media weren't ready for this' - Atlantic: ""These are turbulent times for Resistance Inc. The Robert Mueller fetishization cottage industry is collapsing. Russia conspiracy theorists are frantically tweet-storming as though their life -- or livelihood -- depends on it.

The Judge's Ruling: Legal woes a-coming - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains why President Trump's legal woes are only just beginning: ""Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's 700-page report claims to have characterized fairly Mueller's principal conclusions. Yet a careful reading between the lines of those four pages reveals lawyerly language that the president does not want to hear analyzed. Though the president will not be charged with conspiracy to receive something of value from the Russians in order to affect the outcome of a political campaign (a felony), Mueller clearly found some evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence (probably the 100-plus communications, some in person, between them), but not enough evidence 'to establish' the conspiracy -- that is, not enough evidence to prove the existence of the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. We know Mueller found some evidence of such a conspiracy because if he failed to find any evidence, Barr would have said so. He didn't."" More here.

FOX POLL: WHAT BUGS VOTERS MOST ABOUT TAXES?

Fox News: ""According to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday, voters' top tax concern isn't how much they pay. Instead, they are most concerned about the rich not paying enough (34 percent) and the way the government spends the money (28 percent). About 1 in 10 say what bothers them most is the amount they pay (12 percent), too many people don't have to pay at all (12 percent), and the complexity of the system (10 percent). Compared to 2014, the last time the question was asked, there has been an increase in voters who are troubled that the rich aren't paying enough (+6 points). The shift in frustration comes mainly from self-identified liberals (+20) and voters under age 30 (+14 points). However, it's not limited to traditional left-leaning groups -- voters ages 65 and over (+14), voters earning $50k and over (+11), and whites without a college degree (+9) are also increasingly bothered by the wealthy not pulling their weight.""

[Ed. note: As a collector of the place names of Appalachia, I couldn't pass up your letter, Mr. Kovatch. As best I can figure, there are about 200 people who live in your community, there on the bend of the great Ohio River between Louisville to the east and Evansville, Ind. to the west. It is a beautiful place in creation, indeed. Many of my people lived in or passed through your part of the world since Stirewalts, Hentons, Laytons, Logans and other suspicious characters long, long ago started working the rivers and valleys of Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois.

""In your article about legislation for 'dreamers,' you use the term 'undocumented immigrants.' They are 'illegal aliens,' period! They have broken the law."" - Bob Bush, Summerfield, Fla.

[Ed. note: I suppose you could technically say that they are both of those things, Mr. Bush. I would first point out that we were sharing a Washington Post story, not our own writing in that case. My style is to use neither your freighted term nor theirs. I tend to prefer specificity. In the case of what the article calls ""Dreamers,"" I would say that they are ""people brought to the country illegally as minors."" In general, I tend toward the term ""illegal immigrants."" But sometimes we are able to discuss ""migrant workers,"" ""people who have overstayed their visas"" or the individuals' country of origin. Again, when talking about people, specificity is more useful than generality. Your insistence on the use of the increasingly archaic ""aliens"" seems intended to shame or dehumanize these people. I would remind you that it is possible to favor strict enforcement of immigration laws but to do so humanely and compassionately. Especially when you are talking about people who were brought to the U.S. as children, some of whom who have never known a home other than this one, showing tenderness might cause more people to come around to the general view of supporting more restrictive policies. When you insist on using a term that other people find hurtful, you are labeling yourself more than you are labeling them.]

"Attorney General William Barr says special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not find evidence that President Donald Trump's campaign 'conspired or coordinated' with Russia; reaction from Jehmu Greene, former Hillary Clinton adviser and Fox News contributor, and Buck Sexton, former CIA analyst and host of 'The Buck Sexton Show.'

Actor Michael Rapaport is never shy about publicly bashing Donald Trump on social media. However, his most recent vitriol is directed at the American left for continuing to pursue the Russian collusion angle in an effort to dethrone the president.

The 49-year-old star has received backlash in the past for some of his more brutally honest thoughts on public matters, including politics. In a recent video posted to Twitter, Rapaport dug in deep on ""Democrats and independent snowflakes"" in the wake of Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion with Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.

HOLLYWOOD STARS APOPLECTIC OVER MUELLER PROBE FINDINGS: 'YOU CAN'T INDICT A HAM SANDWICH'

As previously reported, Barr determined that there was no evidence of collusion, which many believe brings an end to the ongoing question. However, several Democrats and those on the left are calling for the report to be released in full.

""This goes out to all my Democratic and independent snowflakes out there: Move on! OK, we don't need to read the f---ing Mueller report,"" Rapaport began his impassioned video speech. ""They didn't get D---stain, OK? They didn't f---ing get him with the Russian thing.""

The star went on to call on 2020 Democratic hopefuls to move on to a different angle and to prepare for a real fight for the White House. While trying to encourage the candidates, he couldn't help but dig into them as well.

""Dust yourselves off and figure out other ways to f--- him. Mainly, whoever's gonna run against him representing the Democrats. That means you, Joe Biden. That means you, crying Cory Booker,"" Rapaport continued. ""Beto, or Beta, whatever the f--- your name is. And Bernie f---ing Sanders. Start training like it's Rocky f---ing III.""

He continued: ""And to all the people out there, stop whining, stop f---ing complaining. You don't need to f---ing read the report. It's over! Figure out another way to f--- D---stain Donald Trump. Because the Russian avenue, it didn't work. We gotta move on. Now!""",4,Fox News,"Michael Rapaport jabs 'snowflakes,' 2020 Democratic hopefuls to 'move on' from the Russia collusion angle"

Against homework: ""The 21st century has so far been a homework-heavy era, with American teenagers now averaging about twice as much time spent on homework each day as their predecessors did in the 1990s. Even little kids are asked to bring school home with them. A 2015 study, for instance, found that kindergarteners, who researchers tend to agree shouldn't have any take-home work, were spending about 25 minutes a night on it. But not without pushback. As many children, not to mention their parents and teachers, are drained by their daily workload, some schools and districts are rethinking how homework should work -- and some teachers are doing away with it entirely.""

I'm against homework as busywork, which we saw a lot of when our kids were in elementary school. The point of limiting homework is to make sure that everything you do in school is necessary. It's not to increase freedom or make life easier on students, which, it seems, is how one English teacher in the article seems to understand it: ""Chris Bronke...eliminated homework for his class of freshmen, and now mostly lets students study on their own or in small groups during class time. It's usually up to them what they work on each day, and Bronke has been impressed by how they've managed their time. In fact, some of them willingly spend time on assignments at home, whether because they're particularly engaged, because they prefer to do some deeper thinking outside school, or because they needed to spend time in class that day preparing for, say, a biology test the following period.""

""There are 290 species of pigeon in the world, but only one has adapted to live in cities. Feral pigeons are synanthropes: they thrive in human environments where they can skim a living off our excess, nesting in the nooks and crannies of tall buildings that mimic the cliff faces on which their genetic ancestors - Columba livia, the rock dove - once lived. We think of pigeons as grey but they are composed of an oceanic palette: deep blues and greens flecked with white, like the crest of a wave. When not mangled or amputated by wire and string, their feet - which the poet Mina Loy described as their 'coral landing gear' - are strong, elegant and reptilian. They can see far further and with greater clarity than we can. In the 1970s and 1980s, the US Coastguard trained pigeons to recognise people lost at sea as part of Project Sea Hunt. The birds were placed in observation bubbles mounted on the bottom of helicopters and trained to peck at buttons when they spotted a scrap of coloured fabric floating in the sea. Pigeons were able to find the fabric 93 per cent of the time. Human subjects managed the same task 38 per cent of the time.

""Pigeons are more intelligent than we give them credit for, one of the few animals - along with great apes, dolphins and elephants - able to pass the mirror self-recognition test. If you mark a pigeon's wing and let it look in a mirror it will try to remove the mark, realising that what it sees is a reflected image of its own body. Pigeons can recognise video footage of themselves shown with a five-second delay (three-year-old children find it difficult to comprehend a two-second delay). They are able to recognise individuals from photographs, and a neuroscientist at Keio University in Japan has trained them to distinguish between the paintings of Matisse and Picasso. 'Modesty,' Marianne Moore wrote, 'cannot dull the lustre of the pigeon.'

""Pigeons move through a human world. They stay close to the land, often flying at street level, below the height of the rooftops. Recent studies have suggested that they navigate using human structures as well as natural ones: they follow roads and canals, and have been observed going round roundabouts before taking the appropriate exit. They can fly extremely fast - up to 110 miles per hour - and with a following wind can cover 700 miles in a single uninterrupted flight (pigeons don't like to fly at night but can be trained to do so). There are faster birds - peregrine falcons, the pigeon's main predator, can reach 200 miles per hour on the stoop - but none can fly horizontally, under its own power, as quickly as a pigeon.

""Feral pigeons are close cousins of the hundreds of varieties of fancy pigeon that have been bred since their domestication by the Sumerians four thousand years ago. The most celebrated, and familiar, of these is the racing homer, a breed selected for its unrivalled navigational abilities. Once their enclosure, or loft, has been imprinted on them - something that happens when a bird is around six weeks old - homing pigeons will return to it for the rest of their lives, even after many years away. They can fly thousands of miles and cross oceans in order to get home. One of the longest homing flights ever recorded was made by a bird owned by the Duke of Wellington, which was liberated from Ichaboe Island, off the coast of Namibia, on 1 June 1845. It took 55 days to fly the 5400 miles back to Nine Elms, where it was found dead in a gutter a mile from its loft.""",5,The American Conservative,"Religious Modernism, Against Homework, and in Praise of Pigeons"
"The resolution aims to ""position the United States as a global leader in clean energy and capture global markets as countries invest in l0w- and zero-emissions technologies.""

In other words, Gaetz is creating a job- and business-friendly Republican alternative to the Green New Deal resolution put forth on February 7 by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow Democrats. That poorly conceived resolution is never going anywhere, as even Democrats, after they got a look at it, walked away from it.

In fact, just on March 26, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- always alert to a clever tactical jab -- arranged for the Senate to vote on the AOC language, knowing that it was hot potato that was sure to lose. And so it did, by a 57:0 vote, as almost all Democrats voted ""present."" Come to think of it, we also shouldn't forget the accompanying FAQ document; you know, the one that included the crackdown on cow farts and a guaranteed income for those unwilling to work.

For his part, Gaetz is sincerely convinced that he is addressing a real problem. As he said in a March 12 tweet, ""Climate change is real. Humans contribute.""

Yet others can observe that politics might be at play. That is, if there's pressure to do something, politicians tend to do it. That's what happens in a democracy; public servants listen to the people.

Still, Gaetz's willingness to get out front on the green issue is notable, because he's a junior member, not assigned to any environmental committee in the House. Plus, of course, as a fixture on Fox News, he's best known for his stalwart defense of President Trump.

To be sure, many on the right will say the best response to the climate issue is no response, because none is justified. That is, it's better simply to tell the greens to go ... you know. After all, the American Enterprise Institute estimates the cost of the Green New Deal as $9 trillion a year-almost half of our total economic output. Indeed, Rep. Mike Bishop (R-UT) said on March 14 that the Green New Deal was ""tantamount to genocide.""

And Gaetz himself is opposed to the Democrats' plan; as he told Vice News on March 25, ""If we embrace a regulatory-centric approach to climate change, we will not reduce pollution, we will merely export it."" That is, mere heavy-handed regulation will chase American industry, and jobs, to less regulatory countries. Gaetz's idea, instead, as we shall see, is clean-energy innovation, including the cleaning up of carbon fuels.

In the meantime, one can be skeptical about climate change -- and there's no shortage of climate skepticism here at Breitbart News -- and still acknowledge that it's an issue that has to be dealt with. That is, if you're a politician, and your constituents are raising concerns about a given issue, it's best to have something to positive to say. By contrast, telling them that they're misinformed, and thus wrong to raise the question, well, that's not a particularly good answer. As they say, soft answers turneth away wrath.

One senior Republican who holds this view is Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee: ""It's important to have a Republican message on climate change that's clear,"" Alexander told reporters on March 25. ""It's clear why we're opposed to the Green New Deal -- it's an assault on cars and cows and combustion -- but it's not as clear what we're for.""

Indeed, if we want to get into the political weeds a bit more, we can observe that Gaetz is doing more of a favor to the Republican Party as a whole than he is for himself. That is, there are still plenty of Republicans representing blue or purple states, where green activism is a real force. So with his Green Real Deal, Gaetz is giving these endangered GOPers some cover. Yes, we Republicans have a plan, too!

Interestingly, Gaetz himself has a safe district in Florida's conservative panhandle; it's been in Republican hands steadily since 1995, and he was re-elected last year with more than 67 percent of the vote.

We might further note that irrespective of the merits of the issue, the pressure on climate change is increasing. For instance, just on March 19, a federal judge in Washington State ruled that the Trump administration was in violation of federal law -- that is, by not considering the impact of climate change as it sought to open up federal lands in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming to oil drilling. In the words of Wyoming's Republican governor, Mark Gordon, ""Bringing our country to its knees is not the way to thwart climate change."" In other words, no energy, no economy, no country.

Unless something changes, there could be a lot more of this sort of judicial activism in the future. In fact, if we think back to the last half-century of bench-based crusading, there's plenty of reason to fear the road ahead. Surely it's at least possible that some judge will rule that more oil drilling -- and who knows, perhaps all oil drilling -- is in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, or some other statute. Yes, most likely, some court, somewhere, would eventually put a crimp on such overreach, and yet, in the meantime, the economic dislocation of litigation already is severe, as is the case with fights over pipelines across the country.

So we can see: Gaetz is smart to put a Republican vision forward, as a way of preempting green activism. And who knows, perhaps it's also solving a real problem.

Moreover, what's most encouraging about Gaetz's vision is that it puts heavy emphasis on carbon capture and storage (CCS).

CCS is simple, really. If carbon-based fuels are putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then let's take the CO2 right back out. As Gaetz's resolution reads, one key goal is ""driving investment in carbon capture storage, carbon capture and use, and otherwise reducing or achieving net-zero emissions from fossil energy.""

With viable carbon capture, we could have our cake and eat it, too; that is, we could burn our fossil fuels and not worry about any impact on the climate. Indeed, CCS could open up the prospect of burning more fossil fuel. And that could be a windfall for the U.S.; back in 2013, the Institute for Energy Research estimated that the total value of oil and natural gas, just on federal lands and waters, was $128 trillion. That's right, trillion with a ""t."" (And we could add to that total, potentially, the value of oil and gas that is not on federal property, as well as, of course, the potential abundance of clean coal.)

So it's little wonder that the carbon-capture idea has been gaining momentum. In an important op-ed published last December in The New York Times, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the mighty Environment and Public Works Committee, zeroed in on CCS:

Groundbreaking new research in the area of carbon utilization to turn emissions into productive commodities, and even direct air capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, also hold keys to major emission reductions. We have made meaningful progress on bipartisan legislation to help researchers engaged in cutting-edge carbon capture and utilization technologies.

And now Gaetz is getting the House Republicans in the game. Good.

The truth is, if carbon capture could prove itself, it would be a godsend for the country, and for red states in particular. That is, inevitably, carbon-capture plants would end up being located in places such as Wyoming, and that would mean jobs for Trump Country. Indeed, it could be kinda cool: One bunch of roughnecks enjoys good jobs at good wages as they go drilling, or mining, the carbon-based fuel, and then another bunch of roughnecks also enjoys good jobs at good wages as they go capturing the wayward carbon dioxide.

And what would be even cooler, as this author has argued, would be to turn carbon dioxide into a solid -- you know, as green plants have been doing for billions of years. So if we put our national noggin to work on a project that Mother Nature has long mastered, we could figure out how to solidify carbon, by turning it into landfill, plastic, carbon nanotubes, and even -- get this -- more carbon-based energy. The non-profit group Carbon 180 has it exactly right when it says, ""Carbon is much more than mere waste.""

Would all this effort be expensive? Maybe, at least at first, until the kinks are figured out; after that, as with all things technological, the cost would surely plummet. And in any case, carbon capture is cheaper than bringing the U.S. economy to its knees, as Wyoming's Governor Gordon says.

Admittedly, much of CCS technology is still speculative. Yet all of American history -- indeed, all of scientific and technological history -- tells us that where there's a will, there's a way.",6,Breitbart,Pinkerton: Matt Gaetz Calls for a 'Green Real Deal'
"After last week's novel two-game series in Japan that featured the retirement of Seattle Mariners ironman Ichiro Suzuki, Major League Baseball opens Thursday with a 15-game slate, an occasion marking the start of its sesquicentennial season.

In most cities, stadiums, festooned with bunting and filled with brass bands and military honor guards, will be near or at capacity. All but one of the games will be played in the daylight, a nod to either tradition or the reality of chilly March evenings - or maybe a little bit of both.

There was a time when baseball played an oversized role in this country, when ""America's Pastime,"" as it's known, garnered the interest, attention and affection of a vast swath of the nation's citizens. Technology helped to spread and solidify its popularity in the public's conscience. The telegraph enabled scores and highlights to be transmitted to distant places, and the advent of radio and the explosion of the newspaper only fed the frenzy of fans.

WHY I KEEP THIS LATE BASKETBALL COACH'S 7-POINT CREED IN MY WALLET

It's easy to qualify days long ago as ""simpler times"" - because in comparison to modern-day stresses, many of the strains of a century ago may seem quaint. But every era contains its challenges and some of yesterday's were far worse than today's. Case in point: the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 claimed between 20 million and 50 million lives worldwide, including 675,000 people here in the United States.

Yet the sport of baseball has remained a constant through it all, a predictable and peaceful presence in a country that has endured its share of volatility. For the last 150 years, the game has survived and even thrived despite world wars, economic roller coasters, national emergencies and political scandals of every size and party.

In fact, in a day and age of hyper-political polarization, baseball strikes me as one of the last bastions of bipartisanship.

I noticed this the other day while scrolling thru my social media feed. Having grown up in New York, many of my friends, some of whom have moved far from Long Island, continue to follow and support the Yankees or Mets, as do I. Many of my friends are super liberal, too, yet we continue to connect and bond over our mutual appreciation for our hometown teams.

Politics plays no role in our love of the game, a very refreshing fact.

There have been exceptions, but Major League Baseball has seemed to largely avoid the political minefields that have ensnared other sport empires like the NFL, NBA or even the ESPN television network.

Why?

Like anything else, there are likely a constellation of factors contributing to baseball's relative purity, from its management style to its player's temperaments.

But I think it also has something to do with the nature of the game itself.

Hugh Fullerton, a sportswriter for the Chicago Tribune in the early part of the 20th century, once observed that baseball was ""the most serious pleasure ever invented"" - a seemingly contradictory comment, except to any of us who love and cherish the great game.

In recent years, officials have been looking for ways to speed up the sport, a response to the average time of a game increasing from under two hours a century ago to over three hours the last few years.

I'm all for eliminating inefficiencies, though much of the extra time is likely attributable to ""profit-center timeouts"" as Rush Limbaugh calls commercial breaks.

Yet, I'm leery at the prospect of fundamentally changing the laid-back nature and pace of the game, an attribute that contributes to the charm and allure of the sport. What's the big hurry?

Whenever somebody tells me they think baseball is boring, I just smile. By ""boring"" they mean ""slow"" - and a lot of today's problems wouldn't blow up into full scale catastrophes if people would just slow down and take a big deep breath.

Growing up in the upper deck of Shea Stadium, I used to love watching the video highlights on the innovative (at the time) Diamond Vision out in left field. One of my favorites was an old black and white clip from the late Hollywood star, Humphrey Bogart.

"Adding justices to the Supreme Court would imperil the American experiment

Across the ebb and flow of history, presidents and senators have pushed and pulled the Supreme Court in one direction or another. Often buffeted by political winds, the Court has nevertheless maintained a safe remove from the whirl of everyday politics, insulated by the Constitution.

But these days, for some, the ""right side of history"" isn't arriving quickly enough.

There is a movement afoot to persuade the crop of presidential contenders to endorse the idea of adding justices to the Supreme Court -- not as a needed reform or a move toward easing the workload of the current justices, but as a naked display of power intended to shift the Court's ideological balance.

In a way, it's refreshing that the supporters of this idea are not trying to hide their intent. But even so, it's a dark road they are headed down.

To be clear, there is nothing in the Constitution that would bar Congress from adding justices to the Court. Through the 19th century, the number fluctuated several times before Congress settled on nine in 1869. It has remained at nine for a century and a half.

But norms play just as important a role in civil society as does law. And packing the Court would abandon 150 years of agreement that overtly politicizing the courts is dangerous to the foundational principle of an independent judiciary.

The Supreme Court, like all institutions of government, is a political body. But that does not mean it is a partisan body. The Court serves a different function than Congress and the president. While the Court has always suffered criticism depending on whose ideological ox is being gored, its legitimacy depends on its moral authority and on society's acceptance of that authority. Preserving that bargain is how we can ensure that the Court remains the protector of our freedoms no matter which way the political winds are blowing.

The very concept of packing the Court would establish a different vision -- a politicized judiciary with judges chosen solely to accomplish specific political results. It would convert the Court into a super-legislature, chosen for life and unaccountable to voters. At the same time, it would exacerbate the already troublesome trend toward abdication of Congress's role as lawmaker, as the elected branches would simply leave difficult political decisions to their unelected colleagues on the Supreme Court.

Judges are human and therefore imperfect. But the ability of litigants before the Court to have confidence in a neutral adjudication of the facts and application of the law is fundamental to our system of justice. Even if we don't assume that a tenth, eleventh, or 15th justice would be politically motivated, perception matters. The Court's decisions would be seen as nakedly partisan by many, diminishing respect for the rule of law and for the authority of the Court.

Apply a simple test to the court-packing proposal, one that should be applied to any argument for more political power: Imagine it in the hands of the politician or political cause you most oppose.

When President Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled his notorious court-packing scheme in February 1937, he was fresh off a landslide reelection and his party enjoyed huge majorities in both houses of Congress.

But history was moving too slowly by Roosevelt's reckoning. Several New Deal initiatives had been blocked by the Court, and he wanted justices who would do his bidding.

At first, it appeared he would get them. But opposition built slowly, led to a great extent by a member of his own party, Montana senator Burton K. Wheeler, an ardent New Dealer.

In a national radio address, Wheeler offered an eloquent explanation for his position that still rings true: ""Create now a political court to echo the ideas of the executive and you have created a weapon . . . that can cut down those guarantees of liberty written into your great documents by the blood of your forefathers and that can extinguish your right of liberty, of speech, of thought, of action, and of religion.""

In a 2017 paper titled ""How to Lose a Constitutional Democracy,"" University of Chicago Law School professors Aziz Huq and Tom Ginsburg called FDR's gambit a ""low point for the rule of law in the United States.""

Where would such a process end? Each party would pack the Court when it came into power (this is exactly what happened in 1801-02), risking legal havoc and further eroding the rule of law and popular respect for the Court.

That the American experiment has succeeded is no accident. It is, in part, the result of a carefully constructed system of government with checks and balances to ensure that power is not consolidated in one person or body, and our liberties thereby imperiled. Congress makes laws, the executive enforces them, and the judicial branch interprets the laws and applies them. Unlike members of Congress or the president, then, the best judges are not those who respond to popular will -- those roles are already taken -- but those who accept that they are restrained by the law and who apply it as written. Such judges, even when they reach results one may not like, serve as a critical check on the political branches, answering to the Constitution and ensuring that our freedoms are not subject to majority vote.

The Supreme Court is the last legal resort to which individuals can appeal to protect their freedoms and settle disputes. The cases, we often forget, involve real people with real problems. Would anyone want the final decision makers in their case to operate from such a blatantly political mindset, or to be chosen not for their fairness and expertise but to accomplish a specific result?

Packing the Supreme Court would make it far more likely that we would be faced with exactly that kind of justice. And that would be no justice at all.",8,nationalreview.com,Court-Packing: A Blow Against the Rule of Law | National Review
"Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume speculates on the contents of the Mueller report and the accuracy of AG Barr's summary.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's nearly two-year investigation is finally over. But President Trump's troubles aren't.

According to a four-page summary of the Mueller report - issued Sunday by Attorney General William Barr as a letter to members of Congress - Mueller confirmed previous intelligence community findings that Russia interfered in our 2016 presidential election; found no collusion by Trump, his campaign or associates with Russia; and reached no conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice by trying to block investigations of him, his campaign and associates.

However, Barr decided to settle the obstruction question himself, writing in his letter to Congress: ""Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""

JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO: ARE TRUMP'S LEGAL WOES OVER OR JUST BEGINNING?

These conclusions are not a full exoneration of Trump, even though the president has claimed they are. And investigations by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives may further examine the collusion and obstruction questions.

n fact, some Democrats are eager to launch multiple investigations of Trump, examining his administration, his campaign, his business dealings, the charity he set up, his tax returns and his personal conduct.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has already alluded to calling Attorney General Barr to testify about the Mueller report and investigation. Some Democrats want Mueller to testify as well. These investigations could go on for months and unearth material that could help Democrats who want to evict Trump from the White House in the 2020 election.

Almost every member of the House recently voted to call for the Mueller report to be made public. None opposed. Even President Trump has said he wouldn't mind the report being made public, but he's leaving the decision up to Barr.

There's no way to know, of course, if the president really wants the world to see the full contents of the Mueller report. But it's smart politics for him to say he's all for full disclosure, while perhaps counting on Barr to keep parts of the report hidden.

Beyond the Mueller report and congressional investigations, here are some dangers President Trump could still face, even with the Mueller investigation closed.

Potential indictments

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is continuing investigations involving some of Trump's associates and his business dealings.

The office employs one of largest group of federal prosecutors in the country, with more than 220 assistant U.S. attorneys and additional administrative and support staff. Its jurisdiction covers part of New York City, where Trump's business is based, and six nearby counties.

These lawyers are skilled and can tackle complex cases. And unlike Mueller, the Southern District does not have a limited mandate. That means prosecutors can follow all evidence of potential illegal conduct they uncover - wherever it takes them.

Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz has said that independence of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York is one of the reasons its investigations should give Trump ""much more to worry about"" than the Mueller probe.

The economy

The booming U.S. economy is slowing down. President Trump bears some responsibility for this due to his trade war with China, the needless federal government shutdown he created, and his erratic policy shifts announced on Twitter that have created uncertainty in financial markets about what he will do next.

Candidate Trump's grandiose promises of shuttered factories reopening and expanding have proven to be wishful thinking. And economists say the president's prediction that the economy will grow 3 percent or more this year was overly optimistic.

On top of this, growing numbers of voters are realizing that tax cuts passed by Republicans are doing much more for the rich than average Americans.

If voters aren't happy about their own economic situation, they're motivated to put the party out of power in the White House.

Allegations by Women

At least 23 woman have accused Trump of sexual misconduct since the 1970s. And adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal have said they had extramarital affairs with Trump and received hush money payments to keep quiet.

On top of this, the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that came out shortly before the 2016 election showed Trump talking about grabbing women by their private parts and kissing them.

Trump has always denied wrongdoing. But since he was elected the #MeToo movement has blossomed and some very prominent men in the media, business, government and other fields have lost their jobs after being accused of sexual misconduct.

The movement is not over and neither are the accusations. Although most of the women who accused Trump spoke out but did not take action. Summer Zervos filed a defamation suit that is still making its way through the courts. Alva Johnson, a former Trump campaign staffer, has filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump kissed her without her consent during the 2016 presidential campaign.

These two lawsuits might cause added pressure and negative news coverage for the president, and could prompt additional women to take legal action against him. This could worsen the gender gap in his approval ratings, costing him the support of more female voters next year.

According to an ABC News poll earlier this year, while 49 percent of men approve of the president's job performance, only 27 percent of women do.

Polls

And speaking of polls, they show the president's overall job approval ratings remain lower than his disapproval ratings. In rounded numbers, the latest RealClear Politics average of polls put his approval rating at 44 percent and his disapproval rating at 52 percent.

The midterm elections seemed to be a referendum on the president. Democrats gained 40 seats in the House and took over the majority in that chamber.

Since he is up for re-election next year, the 2020 election is far more likely to be a referendum on the president. Polls show Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by 13 points and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont by 11 points in head-to-head matchups in a presidential race.

Broken campaign promises

The president has a long list of broken campaign promises. There's not enough space to list them all here.

He told voters he would build a wall along our southern border and said Mexico would pay for it. Mexican leaders have made clear that their nation will never pay for the wall, so now Trump is willing to take funds from our military for the project, endangering our national security.

Trump promised to never cut Medicare but his latest budget proposal proposes large cuts to the health care program for older Americans.

And just this week the president again promised to come up with a better health insurance program to replace ObamaCare, while at the same time ordering the Justice Department to seek to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the courts.

If ObamaCare ends, about 21 million people could lose their health insurance coverage. It's a safe bet that this would increase votes for any Democrat who runs against Trump next year.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has come under fire from state Democrats over a $25,000-a-plate fundraiser. (Fox News)

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is reportedly facing criticism from at least three fellow Democrats over an exclusive $25,000-a-plate fundraiser held at the swanky St. Regis Hotel in New York City earlier this month.

State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi of the Bronx, State Sen. Jessica Ramos of Queens and Assemblymember Yiu-Line Niou of Manhattan accused the governor of hypocrisy after his promises of ""real campaign reform,"" the New York Post reported Thursday.

TRUMP, MEETING WITH ANDREW CUOMO ON TAX REFORM, PIVOTS TO LATE-TERM ABORTION

Biaggi implied that the governor might be engaging in ""pay-to-play"" politics.

""It's impossible to say that a $25,000 ticket is not influencing decisions,"" she said.

A spokesman for Cuomo called his critics ""hypocrites,"" noting they also hold their own fundraisers, the Post reported.

The lawmakers said the fundraiser was an example of why Cuomo should agree to a taxpayer-funded election.

"President Trump focuses on health care reform following Mueller report

On the heels of the Mueller report concluding there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, President Trump is arguably having his ""best week."" But reviving the health-care debate may derail it, Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt said Wednesday.

In a sharp policy piviot, the Department of Justice declared it would move forward to eliminate President Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), after a court deemed it unconstitutional.

During Wednesday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" Stirewalt -- along with National Journal politics editor Josh Kraushaar and national security analyst Morgan Ortagus -- weighed in on the political ramifications of Trump's renewed fight against the ACA, also known as ObamaCare.

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS RATTLED BY TRUMP'S PIVOT TO OBAMACARE FIGHT AFTER MUELLER SUMMARY

Stirewalt declared that this was a ""good week"" for the Republican Party and the ""best week of Donald Trump's presidency"" because of the positive outcomes of the Mueller report.

""To dive into this in this way is not politically savvy for one simple reason: ObamaCare is popular,"" Stirewalt told the panel. ""It's above 50 percent and people are generally satisfied. Quinnipiac polling this week was absolutely clear: People want status quo, don't take away what we got and that's exactly what Republicans are talking about.""

Kraushaar agreed, calling a battle over ObamaCare a potentially ""self-inflicting wound"" for President Trump because health care is the ""one issue that has dogged Republicans.""

""Voters, both Republicans and Democrats, are incrementalists. They're looking at the party that isn't gonna disrupt the status quo more. And you have a lot of Democrats talking about single payer, talking about a lot of really radical proposals on the presidential campaign trail,"" Kraushaar said. ""Well, here you have Trump now saying 'I just want to rip up ObamaCare and I'm gonna support this court ruling.' So you have a lot of congressional Republicans really scratching their heads.""

Meanwhile, Ortagus said Republicans ""shouldn't be running away from health care at all,"" pointing to how the 2018 midterms were about that issue and not Mueller's Russia investigation.

"According to left-wing media Romper, March 27 is annual Muslim Women's Day, an event said to ""elevate the voices of Muslim women by curating content that reflects their experiences.""

On social media, those celebrating the event are using the hashtag #MuslimWomensDay. Among the partners of the event are abortion vendor Planned Parenthood, Teen Vogue, Vice, HerCampus, and NylonMag.

Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, founder of Muslim Women's day and media outlet Muslimgirl.com, told CNN in an interview she and her colleagues ""wanted to create a day where we just celebrate Muslim women ... and engineer a new precedent for Muslim women's representation in mainstream media.""

""Muslim Women's Day is a call to action to ... center Muslim women's voices for the day, to empower us, to flood the Internet with new, diverse, positive stories and Muslim women's voices, and basically just pass the mic,"" she said.

According to Romper, Tlaib and Omar are among six ""amazing"" Muslim women.

Tlaib ""has been unapologetically vocal in her opposition to the Trump administration regardless of backlash and, in what's almost just as cool, as ELLE reported, she let her kids dab on the floor of Congress after she cast her first vote!"" touted Romper.

The media outlet described Omar as ""an iconic symbol for many Muslim woman wearing hijab [sic] hoping to pursue a life in politics.""

""Our theme for this year is 'Muslim women talk back to violence' so, whether it's gun violence or a #MeToo or #TimesUp movement, these are obviously themes that impact women from all backgrounds, across the board,"" said Al-Khatahtbeh. ""But this day is specifically to center Muslim women's voices that often get drowned out of the conversation.""

Al-Khatahtbeh explained that, last year, Muslim Women's Day allowed her organization a chance ""to change the culture around how we talk about Muslim women and how we cover their stories.""

This year, she said her group has more partners involved -- ""more social media networks that are elevating these conversations on their platforms, more organizations that are tapping into this really pertinent conversation.""",12,Breitbart,Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar Celebrated on 'Muslim Women's Day'
"Hollywood actor Chris Evans is launching a political website he hopes will create more ""empathic"" Americans. The Marvel star is pepping this platform despite his own intolerance for the political views of others.

According to a new profile piece from The Hollywood Reporter, Chris Evans has been meeting with lawmakers and looking to leverage his voice as part of the ""Resistance"" to create a new political website called ""A Starting Point.""

Evans campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016; and while he has not decided on his 2020 candidate, his crusading use of his platform has made him a real-life superhero to a certain segment of the online #Resistance. Days after we talk, he pops up on Capitol Hill to do some bipartisan grip-and-grins with Senate Democrats Brian Schatz, Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley and Republican Lisa Murkowski. In March, he does the same at the House of Representatives. It turns out he's conducting interviews for A Starting Point, a politics website whose mission is ""to create informed, responsible and empathetic citizens."" He's a co-founder, along with the actor Mark Kassen and entrepreneur Joe Kiani; the launch date has yet to be announced.

The website, which markets itself as trying to make citizens more empathetic, is being launched as Evans publicly debates cutting off friends if they support President Donald Trump.

As Breitbart News previously reported, in the same THR piece, Evans said that if he learned New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was a Trump supporter, he might have to end his friendship with the Super Bowl champion.

""I really hope he's not a Trump supporter,"" the 37-year-old said. ""I'm just hoping he's one of those guys that maybe supported him and now regrets it.""

""If he doesn't, if he's still on that Trump train, I might have to cut ties. It's really tough,"" the Avengers: Endgame star also said.

"There's ""no evidence"" that First Lady Chirlane McCray's mental- health initiative -- which has burned through $565 million in taxpayers' money so far -- has achieved any measurable results, a lawmaker said Wednesday.

City Councilman Ritchie Torres said he's not ready to scrap the entire ThriveNYC initiative, but wants each of its 41 programs studied with an eye toward dropping those that miss their targets.

""There's no evidence it's working,"" Torres (D-Bronx) said of the overall initiative, which was launched in November 2015 and now has a budget of $250 million a year.

""We have to evaluate the effectiveness of each program. It should be done on a case-by-case basis.

""If there's a program that's been found to be ineffective, we should pull the plug. If there's a program that's been found to be effective, we should continue it.""

Torres' comments came a day after McCray ducked questions during a two-hour City Council hearing about Thrive's spending and results.

""We know as little about the program after the hearing as we knew before the hearing,"" Torres noted.

Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said he's all for more mental-health services -- but wants to know where the money's going.

""We have yet to get a good analysis of where the money was spent and whether we should be adjusting as we move forward,"" he said.

""You have to be asking those questions when you're using government money.""

Despite her weak performance at the council, McCray took to Hot 97 radio Wednesday to attack her critics as ""haters.""

""The truth is haters gonna hate,"" McCray said. ""The haters want to hate because Thrive is doing very important work.""

Mayor de Blasio, who joined his wife on the show, claimed she deserves accolades, not criticism.

""Here's your quiz for the day: Is there a national mental-health strategy for the United States of America. Noooo!"" he said. ""Is there a strategy for New York state. Noooo! The biggest city in the country. She's the one who said we're going to come up with a strategy.""

Sources said it took lawmakers so long to scrutinize Thrive because it's run by the mayor's wife -- an unpaid volunteer -- and they don't want to look as if they're making politics personal.

Tuesday's hearing was tame by usual council oversight standards.

""As I understand, there was a lot of pushback"" from the mayor's office beforehand, another insider said. ""Members were going in knowing that the mayor and members of his team cared a lot about this and that being critical -- we're being critical to the first lady, his wife.""",14,New York Post,Chirlane McCray's ThriveNYC shows 'no evidence' of results: lawmaker
"ABUJA, NIGERIA - Nigeria has the largest economy and population in Africa. Unfortunately, it is also home to growing violence against Christians.

The Religious Liberty Partnership recently hosted a conference of international activists in Abuja to both show solidarity with Nigeria's Christians and consider strategies to battle discrimination and persecution. Stories told by Nigerian participants highlighted the threat posed by violent extremism in a country that otherwise seems destined to become a regional and perhaps world leader.

Unfortunately, Nigeria is not alone. Africa has become an epicenter of religious persecution. Much of the continent is inhospitable to those who worship a different god or the same god differently. Open Doors estimates that 245 million out of 631 million African Christians currently experience high levels of persecution, up from 215 million last year.

Africa remains far from the center of U.S. foreign policy. However, it has begun a long march forward, with democracy expanding and economies growing. That makes the fight against religious extremism and intolerance ever more important. Otherwise stability and peace are likely to remain out of reach, including in Nigeria.

The status of religious freedom varies widely by region and country. The most obvious difference is between the Arabic north and largely black Africa.

For instance, the latest report from the Aid to the Church in Need cites significant violations of religious liberty in Algeria, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya, Libya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, and Tanzania. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom focuses on the worst of the worst, highlighting the cases of the Central African Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, Nigeria, and Sudan.

Open Doors also lists the world's 50 worst persecutors. They include 14 African countries, home to ""extreme"" or ""very high"" levels of persecution: Algeria, the Central African Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, and Tunisia.

The Pew Research Center separates government restrictions from social hostility, rating a dozen nations as having high or very high levels of state control on religion: Algeria, Comoros, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mauritania, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. Eleven were on the high and very high social hostility lists: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Kenya, Libya, Nigeria, Somalia, and Uganda.

Egypt is on every list. Nigeria, Eritrea, Somalia, and Sudan are on all but one list. Algeria, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Mauritania, and Tunisia are on multiple lists.

Nigeria may face the greatest challenge. Christians in some of its Muslim-majority states are treated like second-class citizens. Boko Haram and other radical forces, most notably Fulani herdsmen -- ethnic and tribal and religious divisions largely fall together -- regularly attack Christian villages. Tens of thousands have been killed and millions of refugees created. One of the most poignant stories involves a 15-year-old schoolgirl named Leah Sharibu, kidnapped last year by Boko Haram with 104 of her classmates and denied release along with the rest when she refused to renounce her faith.

Such assaults have become routine. With government unable to stop the killing, the temptation to strike back indiscriminately is growing. Yunusa Nmadu of the Evangelical Church Winning All worries: ""We are at the precipice. If Nigeria goes into civil war, all of West Africa is gone.""

Algeria enforces Islam as a state religion, promulgates blasphemy laws, discriminates against converts, and closes churches. These measures, explains Open Doors, ""make proselytizing and public expression of the Christian faith dangerous as well."" In the Central African Republic, USCIRF cited escalating ""targeted killings based on religious identity."" Muslims there also cite discrimination and have suffered from reprisals launched by nominally Christian ""self-defense"" militias.

In Egypt, Copts are subject to attacks by mobs and terrorists, face legal discrimination, and are targeted by anti-blasphemy laws. Converts face social and legal pressure. Eritrea authorizes only four churches, which it closely regulates; it has raided numerous churches and arrested thousands of people for their faith. USCIRF details ""systematic, ongoing egregious religious freedom violations"" there.

Ethiopia has used its Anti-Terrorism Proclamation against people of faith. In rural areas where Muslims predominate, Christians face discrimination. In Kenya, members of the Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabab have launched terrorist attacks and the government has sought to extend its control over religious groups. In Libya, competing governments have created chaos, allowing extremist groups to operate, attacking Christians and other religious minorities. Christians worship underground; women are at risk of sexual assault and men of forced labor. Religious minorities are subject to laws that ban insults to Islam and ""instigating division."" In Mauritania, citizenship is limited to Muslims and renouncing one's faith is punishable by death. Sharia law and anti-blasphemy statutes apply. Radical jihadist thought is spreading.

Somalia's central government collapsed in 1991 and what laws exist reflect Sharia. Conversion is variously punished and prohibited. Islamist radicalism is spreading and religious minorities must practice their faith underground. Al-Shabab has expressed its determination to ""hunt down"" non-Muslims in areas it controls. In Sudan, religious minorities suffer systematic government harassment and the confiscation and destruction of church properties. Converts face prosecution and social pressure; religious offenses typically are judged by Islamic law. The regime has targeted churches based in the Nuba Mountains, home to a long-lasting insurgency. In Tunisia, according to Open Doors, ""life within Islamic society comes with hostility and daily pressure."" Believers fear the impact of Islamic State radicals returning from Mideast combat.

A number of these countries are North African and Muslim. A couple of them are closely divided, such as Nigeria and Eritrea. A couple are even Christian-majority nations.

The most important animating factor, though, is violent, repressive Islam. Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan are old-line, traditional Islamic oppressors, while rising radicalism has triggered growing violence in majority-Islamic countries Libya, Mauritania, Somalia, and Tunisia. This same force has wreaked havoc in divided Nigeria and majority-Christian Kenya. Similarly brutal are jihadist organizations active in the majority-Christian Central African Republic.

Notes Open Doors:

While the violence from Islamic State and other Islamic militants has mostly disappeared from the Middle East, their loss of territory there means that fighters have dispersed to a larger number of countries not only in the region, but, increasingly, into sub-Saharan Africa. Their radical ideology has inspired, or infiltrated, numerous splinter groups such as Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), a deadly group that broke away from Nigeria's Boko Haram.

U.S. involvement has also created and exacerbated persecutions. For instance, the overthrow of Moammar Gaddafi, backed up by American and European forces, led to chaos and a vacuum in which Islamist radicals have prospered. Washington's enthusiastic embrace of Cairo, which slackened only slightly after the 2014 coup, insulated the al-Sisi regime as it mistreated its sizable Coptic population along with most everyone else. Politics is the chief oppressor in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and an important factor in Sudan, which has killed promiscuously to suppress local and regional separatists. Authoritarian governments fear any opposition, especially one claiming a transcendent allegiance.

Africa is moving forward, but religious violence and persecution threaten its future. Unfortunately, there is little the United States can do, other than observe the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm. Misguided policies in the Mideast have created blowback in Africa. But even a more restrained, less destructive foreign policy will not end Islamic extremism or tyranny, the two most important causes of African religious persecution.

Africa needs reform. Politics needs to incorporate democracy and tolerance. Governments need to become more competent, honest, and responsive. Economies need to better deliver growth and opportunity. People need to reject extremism and cooperate. Although Christians bear the brunt of the persecution, in most African countries, only a handful benefit from the current strife. An end to religious persecution would be a gain for the vast majority.

Americans and other people of goodwill can help by backing peacemakers with resources and prayers. Africa has much to offer in the future. But success requires addressing the continent's internal crises, of which religious persecution is one of the worst.

"President Trump's tax overhaul reportedly led to ""significant savings"" for Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand -- who became the first 2020 presidential candidate to release her tax returns on Wednesday.

While the exact amount that she saved is unclear -- due to Gillibrand reporting a higher income in 2017 than in 2018 -- accountants who reviewed her tax returns told Bloomberg News that the New York senator appeared to save several thousand dollars.

Gillibrand had condemned Trump's sweeping tax law in the past as an example of ""Washington's culture of soft-corruption at its worst.""

""We need to start rewarding work in this country again - not doling out lavish tax cuts for giant companies,"" she blasted in 2017.

Gillibrand and her husband, Jonathan, reported $167,634 from her congressional salary and another $50,000 in business income from her book deal. They paid $29,170 in federal taxes.

Accountants Michael Knight and Steven Rossman -- who work in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, respectively, at two different firms -- reviewed Gillibrand's tax returns for Bloomberg and offered a summary.

According to Knight, the senator saw ""significant savings"" from the GOP tax bill and Rossman says one of the reasons for this is that she and her husband had previously fallen under the alternative minimum tax -- which applies to taxpayers with high economic income by setting a limit on the amount of tax benefits they can receive.

""It helps to ensure that those taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of tax,"" the IRS says on its website.

Trump's tax overhaul all but erased the AMT, and because of this, Gillibrand was able to pay her taxes using the regular system, Bloomberg reports.

That means the senator was able to write off $10,000 of her $35,606 state and local tax bill -- ultimately leading to the new tax cut, according to Rossman.

The tax returns that Gillibrand released Wednesday date back to 2007, when she first took office as a congresswoman.

""For public servants, releasing your tax returns shows the American people that you work only for them, not the powerful,"" she said in a statement.

""We can't fix what's broken in Washington unless we're brave enough to fundamentally change the way our government works, and detox our politics from the influence of unaccountable money,"" Gillibrand added on Twitter. ""Join me in asking every 2020 candidate to release their tax returns.""",16,New York Post,Kirsten Gillibrand benefited from Trump's tax overhaul -- which she
"What is a conservative Trump skeptic to do with the news this week that Robert Mueller's investigation found no conspiracy, collusion or any other word with a ""c"" between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia?

The correct answer is: Celebrate.

Everyone in America should be thrilled to learn that an undeniably aggressive investigation over the course of nearly two years that put the screws to practically everyone who would have been in a position to know about any conspiracy has cleared the president and the campaign of the charge.

Any conspiracy finding would have plunged the country into the greatest political scandal in our history -- a crisis of legitimacy with no parallel. That we have avoided such a crisis is the best news of the Trump presidency -- for everyone.

Those in the ""never-Trump"" camp who seem unwilling or ¬≠unable to accept Mueller's conclusions are exposing themselves as less interested in the truth than they are in having their negative judgment of Trump validated and their wish to see him driven from office fulfilled no matter the larger cost such a thing would have ¬≠imposed on the American future. (Yes, I am often listed as being among their number, but I always resisted having my views reduced to a Twitter hashtag.)

The Mueller finding means the 2016 election was not fatally compromised by Americans acting on behalf of a foreign power. It means that the choice of the American people at the ballot box in 2016 will be the subject of the 2020 election, as is meet and proper.

Has the change the American people sought to effect by giving Trump 306 electoral votes been good or bad for the country? Will Trump have fulfilled his constitutional duties and his political obligations? Will his Democratic challenger make a better case for running the executive branch of the United States from 2021 to 2025?

Only by answering these questions in the conventional way, at the ballot box, can the American people provide answers we desperately need to questions about how our politics are to work henceforth.

A conventional election will give the voters a chance to make clear to themselves and to the world whether they condone Trump's unprecedented example and think that it is a suitable baseline for ¬≠future political action.

If he wins, his personally aggressive and informal style of communication will set a new standard for the ways in which politicians talk about each other and themselves.

If he wins, the perceived link ¬≠ ¬≠between personal character and political leadership, stretched to the breaking point by Bill Clinton a generation ago, will be sheared completely -- to the benefit of ¬≠sociopathic politicians who will not be expected to show qualities of personal restraint or political generosity of any kind.

This is what the 2020 election should adjudicate. But its results will be muddied and accurate conclusions difficult to draw if Democrats continue along the irresponsible and reckless path they appear intent on following.

If the Democratic nominee comes from the fever swamps of the populist Left in the way Trump emerged from the bubbling cauldron of the populist Right, the choice before the American people will be a choice between extremes.

The Democratic line will be that Trump has unleashed the forces of fundamentalist fascism on the United States. The Trump line will be that Democrats seek to impose godless socialism on the nation. The ugliness of the campaign will be unparalleled, and the ultimate choice of the voters will be a choice between views and behaviors of which (I expect) most voters actually disapprove.

Over the past two years, one of the great tropes of the mainstream media has been the demand that Republican politicians and conservative thinkers show backbone in opposing Trump when he traduces political and cultural norms.

As someone on the Right who has not joined the Trump camp, I think I'm uniquely well-positioned to say: The shoe is on the other foot, you guys. The years through which you longed to learn the president of the United States was elected illegitimately should now be over.

And if your team picks an anti-capitalist America-hater who plays footsie or worse with anti-Semitism, I expect you to be on the barricades calling out the wrongdoing of your comrades and seeking a better American future.",17,New York Post,"If Dems and NeverTrump don't move on after Mueller report, they'll"
"Fiscal watchdog: A NY Tax Policy That Actually Worked

Back when New York's 2 percent property-tax cap was set to become law in 2011, the teachers union ""warned of an apocalypse,"" recalls Empire Center analyst Ken Girardin at auburnpub.com. Yet eight years later, ""districts are better funded than ever,"" with outlays ""nearly 90 percent more per pupil than the 50-state average."" Meanwhile, school-tax growth ""has slowed by more than two-thirds, to an average of 1.8 percent a year, saving homeowners and business billions in 2018 alone."" The cap, Girardin argues, forced districts to be more cautious with public funds and drive ""harder bargains"" in contract talks. And that's what the union really feared.

That ""crooked culture vaulted to national attention"" Tuesday with the ""inexplicable dismissal"" of charges against actor Jussie Smollett.

In the process, Smollett ""showcased for the country how the crooked Chicago way works.

Conservative: Anti-Semitism Resolution Bad for the Jews

Not surprisingly, Congress' recent move to condemn anti-Semitism ""began badly for the Jews; it ended badly for the Jews; and in the middle was whole heaping pile of bad for the Jews."" Yet the irony, notes Seth Mandel at The Washington Post, is that the resolution that passed ""wound up rebutting anyone who sees shadowy forces directing Washington."" After all, Jews were ""powerless to stop it."" The key problem, Mandel believes, is the way politics has become about hating the other political side, which creates ""an ideal setting for Jew-hatred to thrive."" For Jews, there's a Catch-22: Criticizing anti-Semitism is taken as proof of the anti-Semite's accusations. And Americans' obsession with ""sussing out ulterior motives"" doesn't just make common ground more elusive; it's also ""bad for the Jews.""

Foreign desk: Three Cheers for Trump's Golan Move

""There's a sound rationale for America's recognizing the Golan Heights"" as part of Israel, as President Trump recently did. So argues Douglas Feith in National Review. Syria, which formerly claimed Golan, is a ""failed experiment"" and a broken state. And it's not as if Syrian leaders respect the sovereignty of others. Indeed, ""they have continually used their military forces or terrorist proxies to violate the sovereignty of Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel."" Thus, ""there is no compelling reason"" to try to reassemble Syria exactly as it was before the civil war. The Golan, especially, shouldn't be returned: In the past, Syria's regime used its higher ground to terrorize Israeli civilians below. ""Preserving borders is a good thing,"" Feith says, ""but not always.""

"""You don't run for second place,"" Stacey Abrams told the ladies of The View this afternoon. Abrams, who refuses to concede her loss to Georgia governor Brian Kemp last October, is enjoying a second life as a potential candidate for U.S. Senate or, why not, president in 2020. Indeed, Abrams has become so popular among Democrats that a few advisers to Joe Biden recently told the New York Times that he might announce Abrams as his running mate long before the first caucuses and primaries are held next year.""With a younger but still accomplished vice-presidential nominee at his side,"" the Times reasoned, ""Mr. Biden could hope to demonstrate his commitment to diversity and to restoring stability to Washington.""

Well, it was thought. At the moment Biden is hoping to recover from all the bad press that the Times has brought him. The Abrams trial balloon popped soon after it was launched. Progressive critics found Biden's idea paternalistic and condescending. Yesterday, he fell face-first into the identity-politics cauldron by saying that America's ""English jurisprudential culture, a white man's culture,"" has ""got to change."" By dropping the principles of due process? Biden didn't elaborate.

Still, his gestures toward woke culture have won him few friends. Many Progressives can't forgive him for not being able to stop Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court three decades ago. His paeans to diversity only remind Democrats of his age, sex, and pallor.

Michael Tomasky stated Biden's dilemma well earlier this month. ""Nearly everyone thinks he can beat Donald Trump,"" Tomasky wrote, also in the Times. ""At the same time, no one thinks he'll get the chance to do it."" Nor are his chances improving. Biden maintains a double-digit lead in national polls of Democrats, but his margin in the states is narrowing, or gone altogether. He's one point ahead of Bernie Sanders in Emerson's recent Iowa poll. Emerson's Wisconsin poll has him 15 points behind Sanders. A February poll of New Hampshire Democrats had him 4 points behind Sanders.

Money will be a problem. ""Those close to the former vice president believe he would start off at a fundraising disadvantage compared with would-be rivals, whose campaigns have benefited from an early flood of small-dollar donations from the most liberal wing of the party,"" the AP reported earlier this month. If Biden isn't able to match Robert Francis O'Rourke's $6.1 million raised in 24 hours, his candidacy will be in trouble. For a popular former vice president who's been in public life since 1972 and run for president twice before to be outraised by an ex-congressman who has trouble controlling his arm movements and a 77-year-old socialist would be credibility killing.

Biden is reminding Democrats of his flaws, when he should be using this time to make an affirmative case for his candidacy that goes beyond airy assertions of ""electability.""

"Evans has criticized Brady before, and this latest slight against the NFL player comes in a wide-ranging interview with the Hollywood Reporter.

The Avengers: Endgame actor told the paper that he understands that actors may not want to ""alienate half your audience,"" but he had to admit that he just doesn't care what people he disagrees with think about politics.

That point brought the paper to ask the Captain America star about his constant needling of the Super Bowl-winning Brady for his support of Trump.

""His willingness to call bullshit on anyone abetting the disintegration of our republic extends to his home state's favorite sons,"" Hollywood Reporter gushed. The paper then asked if Evans would agree to play Brady in a movie. According to the Reporter, Evans ""looked grim"" at the very thought.

Maybe he thought it was going to be different -- and even that bothers me -- but maybe there's a chance now he just thinks Trump's an absolute dumb shit, which he is. If he doesn't, if he's still on that Trump train, I might have to cut ties. It's really tough.""

But Evans added, maybe Brady has reconsidered and just won't let on.

""I think maybe a couple of years ago,"" he added, ""I might have tried to pull some, like, mental gymnastics to compartmentalize, but I don't know if I can anymore. So I'm just hoping he's woken up.""

"The 'salacious and unverified' documents invaded the body politic like a cancer.

The Mueller investigation has concluded, and Mueller's declaration has now entered the public record: ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" But it's worth reflecting on how the contrary view -- the firm conviction that Trump did coordinate with Russia -- became so deeply embedded in the hearts and minds of millions of Americans. And it's worth reflecting on why another set of Americans could look at actual, troubling evidence of Russian contacts and simply not care at all.

The answer is complex, but at its heart is a set of documents compiled into a collection known as the ""Steele dossier."" The dossier, characterized by James Comey under oath as ""salacious and unverified,"" consisted of opposition research compiled by a former British intelligence officer and commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign. Taken as whole, it undermined the credibility of American intelligence agencies, corrupted elements of the media, and distorted the public debate. It may well be one of the most malignant documents in modern American history.

I'm not going to link to the dossier, but it's worth remembering its core claim. As explained in this December analysis in Lawfare, the document not only contained claims that Russia possessed lurid, compromising information on Donald Trump, it also made the sensational allegation that there existed a ""well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [Trump and his associates] and the Russian leadership,"" including an ""intelligence exchange [that] had been running between them for at least 8 years."" The very existence of this allegation detonated like a bomb in the American body politic.

It had an obvious distorting effect on the intelligence community and parts of the American government. To be clear, I believe that the Trump-Russia investigation would have existed even without the dossier -- I'm with Trey Gowdy on that point. As Devin Nunes wrote in his famous February 2018 memorandum alleging FISA abuse, information about George Papadopoulos triggered the opening of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016. Moreover, the multiplicity of problematic Trump-team contacts with Russians or Russian operatives justified an investigation regardless of the dossier's contents or the dossier's use by the FBI.

The dossier was used to form a crucial part of the Carter Page FISA-warrant applications, however: The Nunes memo notes that ""Deputy Director McCabe testified . . . that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the dossier information."" In addition, elements of the dossier made it to lawmakers including Harry Reid and John McCain, and the FBI ultimately even briefed then-president-elect Trump about its contents. While the summary it provided Trump is still largely redacted, it is easy to imagine how the existence of such a document could enrage the president.

I urge you to read Chuck Ross's well-reported account of the comprehensive efforts to ""seed the dossier with reporters and government officials."" The efforts were in fact so comprehensive -- and the existence of its allegations such an open secret with the press -- that I even heard about it in Tennessee during the later stages of the campaign. I was flat-out told that there was evidence Trump had been ""compromised"" by Russian intelligence.

Salacious rumor-mongering is par for the course in politics. I've heard the wildest stories about even the most staid politicians. And when politicians aren't staid, well, there are no boundaries. To this day, there are folks lurking around the dark quarters of the Internet absolutely convinced that the Clintons are responsible for a string of murders in Arkansas.

But even in the face of widespread rumors, responsible journalists -- or journalists who aspire to responsibility -- do not print the rumor, at least not without verifying or debunking it. They should not print the rumor even if they know that law enforcement is looking into it.

Let's try a hypothetical. Imagine if you're a reporter and you know that local police are investigating a wild claim against a prominent local figure. You've started to look into the claim yourself, but so far everything you've learned contradicts the allegations. Do you dump it into the public domain anyway, heedless of the impact on the public or the person?

Well, if you're BuzzFeed, that's exactly what you do. While it may well be newsworthy that the FBI is looking into claims that Trump is ""compromised,"" there's a vast difference between that factual report and just tossing a raw opposition-research file into the public square and telling people to ""make up their own minds.""

That makes no sense. None. Between taking kids to soccer practice and dance lessons, parents aren't able to determine whether Michael Cohen went to Prague. As I wrote at the time, ""individual Americans aren't free-standing intelligence agencies, ready and able to investigate alleged Russian operations in Moscow."" If a journalist hears a claim, he should investigate. Not punt to the public.

BuzzFeed's decision had two immediate effects. First, it demonstrated the extent to which an influential media outlet would depart from best practices when it possessed negative allegations against Trump. Second, the instant the claims were published, millions of Americans became convinced they were true. Combine the recent pain of a shocking electoral loss, Russia's intervention in the campaign to help Trump and sow chaos generally, Trump's incredibly odd behavior toward Putin, and the emerging reports (some overblown) of unusual contacts between Trump's team and Russians or Russian assets, and Democrats were primed to believe the worst. Moreover, the dossier's memo formats, which looked like movie versions of intelligence reports, enhanced their public credibility. They were official-looking.

And so we were off to the races. An odd sort of consensus developed on the left and the right. In essence, it was this: The dossier is the scandal. On the left, a kind of blind faith emerged that the purpose and ultimate inevitable outcome of the Mueller investigation were to prove the core claims (if not all the specifics) of the dossier. People weren't singing songs to Mueller with the expectation and hope that he'd simply lay out the facts. They believed that they already knew the facts, it was up to Mueller to come through with the proof.

On the right, when the dossier became the scandal, that meant that misconduct -- even lies about contacts with Russians or Russian assets -- that fell far short of the dossier's grandiose claims was treated simply as no big deal. If a meeting with a Russian lawyer with the intention of getting damaging information about Hillary Clinton or alleged efforts to establish back-channel communications with WikiLeaks through Roger Stone fell far short of the dossier's claims, then they were nothing to worry about -- a distraction from the ""real"" scandal of the ""Russia hoax.""

Moreover, a veritable industry sprang up that attempted to tie the entire Trump-Russia investigation to the dossier, to somehow prove that absent the dossier, there never would have been a comprehensive investigation of Russian contacts with the Trump campaign, much less a special counsel. Troubling conduct and contacts by Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and others were swept aside as meaningless. The dossier was the chief weapon in the effort to delegitimize the investigation itself, and it was a potent weapon indeed.

For all of their other accomplishments, the Clintons are leaving American public life with a legacy of lies and lawlessness. Bill Clinton's shameless behavior, perjury, and obstruction of justice led to his impeachment. Hillary's serial deceptions and her grotesque mishandling of classified information led to her defeat. The dossier, however, in its sheer negative impact on American public life, may be her most infamous ""achievement."" Her campaign -- and ultimately Hillary herself -- bears responsibility for the chaos it sowed.

But key members of the media and the government share in that responsibility. The dossier redefined the debate. It was a cancer, and it sickened American culture and politics. Our nation is weaker because that document entered the bloodstream of the body politic.",21,nationalreview.com,"The Steele Dossier, Hillary Clinton's Malignant Gift to America | National Review"
"President Trump declares victory on Mueller probe, counterattacks critics

After three major independent and special counsel investigations -- one which ended in the resignation of a president, one which went down the wire to impeachment and an acquittal in the Senate and now the Russia-Trump investigation has ended in all but clearing the president and his top staff, it is crystal clear that the important process of holding presidents accountable needs an overhaul.

I fought the 1998 attempt to unseat President Clinton, and when I saw how strong the bias was against this president, I objected to it on the grounds that there was never a real, verified basis for such an investigation. Any fair read of the dossier which seems to have prompted the Russia-Trump probe would have revealed its contents to be far-fetched at best. An investigation launched by a dubious document continued to be plagued by problems and politics. Now, one of the most important jobs coming off this experience is to prevent this from ever happening again by putting in place new safeguards and rules. For starters, we need some failsafe mechanisms that would block an administration from spying on opposition campaigns. The days of J. Edgar Hoover are long gone, but as we learned, some of his methods have crept back into the system.

THE MUELLER REPORT: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW SO FAR

To protect future presidents, whether they be Democrats, Republicans or Independents, let's agree to a ""bill of rights"" for political parties, campaigns and administrations to prevent the future weaponization of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies in gross violation of the First Amendment and other freedoms. Let's give special counsels the power they need, but curb their excesses. Here's what I propose:

1. Let's repeal or modify the Logan Act, the seldom-invoked law barring unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments so that it does not apply to incoming administration officials that are part of a transition team. This will avoid the kind of mischief played by Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover, on Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the incoming National Security Advisor.

2. All information used to initiate a special counsel investigation must come from regular intelligence sources, not extra-legal channels, and must meet the highest levels of verification before being utilized for the purpose of appointing a special counsel or to conduct wiretaps or other surveillance. Such verification must be signed and countersigned by top intelligence officials, who must also declare they have no conflict of interest arising from their employment or employment of family members. They must disclose the full history of where and how the information was received.

3. Warrants to surveil campaign or administration officials must be obtained through the regular federal courts, not FISA courts. Such courts have adequate safeguards when secrecy is needed but have higher standards for the issuance of warrants. FISA courts have become secret backdoor open channels for warrants to spy on American citizens.

4. The principal investigators of any issues that have arisen will be agents and prosecutors acting in the normal course of their duties and may be supervised, but not supplanted by, the political appointees at the top. Any unusual activities, like suggestions to wiretap the president or call investigations ""matters"" must be reported to both the attorney general and the inspector general.

5. Special counsels are hereby classified as principal officers, requiring confirmation by the Senate. Their terms will be for one year unless renewed by the Justice Department and confirmed by the Senate. If the investigation involves political campaigns or administration officials, the team will have roughly equal numbers of prosecutors from the two parties. Should the attorney general be conflicted out of selecting a special counsel, the task will be performed by unanimous agreement of the next two officials of the Justice Department. All selections will go through the highest level of conflict checks over past clients and internal relationships.

6. Excessive intimidation tactics are hereby banned. Such tactics include arresting or raiding the offices of non-violent suspects with armadas of agents with guns drawn at offices and private residences and rousting witnesses at 6 a.m., as we saw with raids on the homes of Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. They will be afforded reasonable bail and not be placed under any gag orders preventing them from commenting publicly upon the prosecution. Political prosecutions need air, not secrecy.

7. The use of process crimes to squeeze defendants to plead guilty to other crimes is hereby forbidden. Should such crimes occur during the investigation, they will be turned over to a separate group of prosecutors with discretion to prosecute those crimes on their own based on their materiality. Prosecutors may not use crimes like tax evasion or failure to register as lobbyists to extract guilty charges to other crimes that might not otherwise be proven in court to build a narrative.

8. Lawful campaign and government transition records such as emails will be obtainable only through the legal process, not through deals with holdover administration members. And all standard protocols will be observed for questioning and obtaining White House information, which include working through the White House counsel, not just sending agents over to interview subjects, as the FBI did with Flynn. Any unmasking - naming of Americans recorded on phone calls with foreigners under surveillance - involving campaign or administration officials will always be reported to the attorney general and the relevant inspector general, and unmasking will be greatly limited to the smallest possible circle.

9. Those who were investigated by a special counsel but not charged will receive the maximum possible protections of their privacy upon the conclusion of the investigation, the right to review and comment on the report before it is released and full recovery of all attorneys' fees. Anyone acquitted after being charged by a special counsel will receive double their attorney's fees.

10. This can only be advisory, but the press, courts and Congress will give appropriate deference to a completed report and they will have access to the non-classified, non-grand jury components of it -- no more and no less.

Let's get these measures in place now and we will still have special counsels when we need them. They will simply have to conduct themselves not through intimidation but with the fairness and due process that is the hallmark of American justice and democracy.",22,Fox News,Mark Penn: Fixing the special counsel statute in 10 not-so-easy steps
"In the early 1930s, the Bremen docked regularly on the Hudson River by West 46th Street -- and it was a wonder.

The length of three football fields, the ship was built for luxury. Equipped to host 2,200 passengers and 950 crew, with everything from Turkish baths to a library stocked with the world's finest literature, it was the ideal vacation-ready ocean liner.

The only drawback was the swastika flag flying high aboard its bow.

As the Bremen routinely sailed between Germany and New York, ferrying dignitaries and other wealthy revelers, the horrors of the Nazi regime were leaking out to the world. But too many -- including President Franklin Roosevelt -- chose to ignore or deny the atrocities at that time.

Yet merchant marine Bill Bailey knew the truth, and his protest against the Bremen would make him the first American to take a public stand against Nazi aggression, writes Peter Duffy in the new book, ""The Agitator"" (PublicAffairs), out now.

Bailey was born in 1915 in Jersey City. Living in dire poverty with his mother and five siblings, his drunken lout of a father having run off, he sensed early on that the sea would be his escape.

When he was 14, he visited every pier on the Hudson River until the captain of an old freighter agreed to take him on.

""I stood there lying like hell,"" Bailey later said. ""Told him I was an experienced seaman, been on all seven seas including the Dead Sea. I could do anything on a ship, blah, blah, and I'm 21 years old ... And the guy just said, 'Yeah, OK.' And from then on, I had a job as an ordinary seaman.""

Working on various ships throughout the years, Bailey saw the world for real. In 1932, he ended up in Germany, where he got a rare up-close look, for an American, at the encroaching Nazi horror.

""Bailey was inspired by the fighting spirit of the Communist longshoremen ... and outraged by the brutality of Nazi storm troopers, who were already running all over Germany, punching people out, kicking windows in, attacking Jews,"" Duffy writes.

Those experiences abroad colored Bailey's politics. In 1933, he was 18 and between jobs in New York, when he joined the Marine Workers Industrial Union. He began speaking publicly, recruiting union members among the dockworkers. He also became a member of the Communist Party.

By 1935, the Bremen was a popular attraction in the city. Whenever it docked to discharge passengers from Germany and take on new ones for the return trip, several thousand New Yorkers were allowed on board for a fee to party for one night. At night's end, a horn would blow, urging visitors off the ship.

By then, many New Yorkers were aware of Germany's atrocities, and the Bremen was increasingly met with thousands of protestors who felt Hitler's prized vessel should not be welcomed to our shores, much less be used to dine and dance. As authorities continued to allow it to dock, Bailey and his fellow party members decided to do something to ""wake this goddamn United States up,"" Bailey later wrote.

With the Bremen due in New York again on July 26, 1935, the leaders of Bailey's Communist Party branch came up with a plan. As protests were already expected on the street below, several dozen party members -- male and female -- would dress in their finest eveningwear and board the boat like revelers. When the horn blasted, telling non-passengers to leave the boat, several of the women would handcuff themselves to the ship's mast and create a distraction. Then, the men would seize the swastika flag and march it off the boat to the party chairman, who would set fire to it in the street.

At first, the role of capturing the flag fell to one of the party's longest-serving members, 36-year-old Merchant Marine Edward Drolette.

But Drolette ""couldn't keep his mouth shut,"" and the plan got leaked to the NYPD. When Drolette boarded the Bremen sometime after 10:30 p.m., police were on his tail. By that point, the ship was in full-on party mode, with passengers including Henry S. Morgan, grandson of J.P. Morgan and future founder of Morgan Stanley, and William Donner Roosevelt, ""the 2-year-old grandson of the president of the United States.""

Meanwhile, Bailey and two fellow Communists, Mac Blair and Paddy Gavin, wandered the deck toward the flag, ""occasionally barking out a 'Sieg Heil' for appearance's sake.""

By 11:15 p.m., the NYPD notified the Bremen's owners that infiltrators had breached their security, and the ship's commander ""issued an order seeking the removal of all visitors."" But the 4,800 people on board made that impossible while also blocking Drolette's starboard path to the flag.

So the infiltrators changed their plan, and agreed that Bailey, Blair and Gavin would capture the flag from port side instead.

At 11:45 p.m., the ship's horn blew, encouraging visitors to leave. In the melee, the handcuff plan was abandoned, but one lone Communist protestor marched toward a restricted portion of the deck.

When a Bremen crew member barked a rebuke, the rebel wound up his fist and ""lobbed a haymaker that knocked the man flat on his back.""

Chaos took hold, and Blair and Bailey seized their moment.

Bailey slipped past the authorities, but Blair felt a hand on his neck. Seeing it belonged to a Nazi crew member, he turned and stabbed him in the face with a fountain pen. Bailey paused to help, but Blair urged him on.

""Keep going!"" he yelled. ""Get up there!""

Leaping aboard the ship's gunwale with police nightsticks swinging around him, Bailey began to climb a flimsy ladder.

With ""a roar of triumph"" rising around him from the thousands of protestors on the street, Bailey reached for his target.

""Feeling 'almost stage fright,' Bailey took a moment to glance down,"" Duffy writes. ""Without a rail to brace himself, he understood that the slightest misstep would put him in the drink. He tugged at the swastika, which ripped along the top seam."" But he couldn't get the bottom half of the flag to move.

As he struggled, one of his comrades pulled out a switchblade and cut the rope holding the flag. Suddenly the swastika fell loose and was now fully in Bailey's hands.

It was now or never.

""Bill Bailey hurled Hitler's treasure into the Hudson River,"" Duffy writes. ""The swastika came sliding down, disappeared a moment, ballooned up and went skimming through the air dropping into the water below.""

Said Bailey later of his triumph: ""It was a moment worth everything ... just to see that sonofab***h in the water and the Germans going stark mad! And the crowd on the dock stark mad with delight.""

Afterwards, a State Department spokesperson issued an apology to Germany before one was even requested, saying, ""It is unfortunate that two or three persons should mistreat the flag of any nation with which the United States is at peace.""

Bailey, Blair, Drolette and three of their co-conspirators were arrested and dubbed ""The Bremen Six"" in the press, which at the time firmly took the side of the Nazis. They were charged with felonious assault on a police officer and intent to breach the peace, but after long, high-profile trials, all six were acquitted.

The Bremen, meanwhile, continued its New York to Germany route, with a new swastika flag flying high until September 1939, when Great Britain declared war on Germany and it returned home for good. The ship was destroyed in an attack by the British Royal Air Force and sold off for scrap metal.

In the postwar years, Bailey was destroyed as well, getting caught in the Red Scare of the time, blacklisted and kicked out of the Marine Workers union for being a Communist in 1950. Six years later, Bailey quit the Communist Party himself, because he realized that Stalin was a ""paranoid, sick SOB.""

He spent the next few decades as a longshoreman and activist in San Francisco where he gave radical walking tours of the city and reemerged as a father figure to other liberal organizers. Robert De Niro even relied on Bailey's experience on the blacklist for his 1991 film ""Guilty by Suspicion,"" in which the old seaman had a walk-on role as a security guard.

Bailey suffered from a lung condition caused by asbestos exposure from his work on the high seas. But even that didn't dim his passion until his death in 1995, age 79.

""To witness an injustice and do nothing,"" he once said. ""That is the biggest crime.""",23,Fox News,How one man launched a mutiny on a Nazi ship in New York City
"Just in case you haven't yet gotten your fill of post-Mueller commentary, I offer my download in list form, hoping that some of these key takeaways will find consensus agreement (they won't, but they should), and hoping that they will serve as a useful summary for those looking for a concise breakdown of what has just transpired.

1. President Trump did not collude with Russia to steal the election. Of course, all I am saying here is what the two-year, $25 million investigation said. It did not merely fail to prove collusion -- it made this finding ""despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."" If the point of the special counsel was to determine whether President Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia to steal this election, we now have our answer and can presumably move on with our daily practice of not listening to each other, misrepresenting each other's views, and choosing sides in each issue with as much tribal bias as humanly possible.

2. President Trump did not obstruct justice. Not only did both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (no friend to Trump) and new Attorney General William Barr (as respected a legal practitioner as D.C. has had in a generation) both say so, but our own logic and human reason mandates this conclusion. For the firing of James Comey to constitute obstruction, President Trump would have had to fire someone he had every legal right to fire because that person was investigating a crime that President Trump did not commit. It is an incoherent view, and any insistence from the Democrats to keep fighting over this issue will prove fatal to the Democrats' cause.

3. Now, before we get carried away here, the statement that President Trump did not collude with Russia (he didn't), or could not collude with Russia (truly, that campaign team could not have done so -- just in terms of basic acumen and sophistication), in no way means he would not collude with Russia. We already know from the Donald Jr. escapade what these folks think about the ethics of collusion. So I believe that he is, all at once, legally vindicated, operationally stunted, and, yes, morally flexible. All of these things strike me as somewhat undeniable by any pro-Trump or anti-Trump observer.

4. I find it hard to avoid the conclusion that Robert Mueller looks like an extremely objective and fair jurist in this whole escapade. I understand that many feel that some of the tactics along the way have been extreme (the early-morning raid on Manafort, for example), but does anyone believe that Paul Manafort was not as guilty as O. J. of the crimes he was accused of committing? At the end of the day, all nearly anyone knows about Mueller is that he has been radio silent through this entire affair, and in the end, went where the evidence brought him, which is an overwhelmingly unpopular place with the intelligence complex that he supposedly was loyal too.

I have been sandbagging this note from someone I respect as much as anyone I have ever met, and who worked closely with Mueller for many years: ""I did not know Comey, only knew a few things about him. I had met him and had the opportunity to speak with him briefly. He has proven himself to be a narcissist, a coward, and an opportunist. He damaged the FBI, and the country for his own benefit with no regard for the consequences. I blame him for the recent failures of FBI leadership in DC. Mueller, I know. He is a man of integrity. He is an honorable man and I believe he will bring the investigation to a conclusion without leaving any matters unattended. Mueller is a no nonsense, hard nosed patriot. He is not afraid of his detractors nor is he a politician. He has my confidence.""

It seems hard to conclude differently at this point in time.

5. Trump's innocence in the collusion charge notwithstanding, there is no reason to give him a pass for his ridiculous choice of lieutenants throughout the campaign, the early part of his administration, and for much of his adult life. A very simple question can be asked here: Would there ever have been an investigation had President Trump not retained the services of a lowlife such as Paul Manafort, or used Roger Stone as a political consultant, or rebuffed the advice of everyone under the sun to avoid Michael Flynn, or hired a degenerate like Michael Cohen? I am not suggesting that President Trump deserved this attack, because he did not. I am not advocating for a guilt-by-association ethic. I am merely saying the same thing I say to my own kids: Never forget that whom you associate with will end up sticking to you, either positively or negatively.

6. The Democrats risk losing the most winnable election of their lifetimes for a lot of reasons, first among them being the possibility they will nominate some type of pro-infanticide socialist who has sworn allegiance to a social-justice mission of identity politics that is repugnant to the vast majority of Americans. But they are also driving off the cliff with this insane narrative of Trump as a Russian stooge. There are cooler heads in their leadership who will do what they can to avoid this, but it is a political loser, and for good reason. Hillary Clinton lost the election in 2016 fair and square, and the $25 million that has been spent to delegitimize President Trump will now create ten times the benefit to his reelection campaign, twenty if they do not move on.

7. And last but not least, there is a significant amount of shame that ought to be spread around here. Yes, I agree with my friend David French that the Sean Hannity/Seth Rich conspiracy should not be forgiven. But as it pertains to this case, the opportunism of James Comey, the outrageous behavior of John Brennan, and of course the media coverage (from CNN to MSNBC to Buzzfeed to the major networks) have been nothing short of despicable. They ought not be forgotten, and all of these people deserve the humiliation they are enduring this week.

The aftermath to the special counsel's report is playing out much the same way that the lead-up did: in line with each observer's own tribalistic instincts. This is the state of American politics now, and there is no real end in sight. The Left has beclowned itself throughout this saga, and yet the points I make above (see Nos. 3-5 in particular) are likely to be met with opposition from many on the Right, for the simple reason that they don't go along with a narrative many want. I believe it is up to the president to lead the way out of this mess, to bring the China trade deal to a close, and to spend the next 18 months leading, guiding, and speaking with a more credible and morally authoritative voice.

And as has been the case since January 2017, the last thing I worry about in that objective for the president is Russian collusion. Rather, I just worry about his own temperament and discipline. But at least for this week, he has the benefit of achieving a major victory over a powerful enemy who wished to do him harm.

"House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell on standing by collusion claims against President Trump.

I'm confident that if there were another jihadist attack, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., would be right there with his fellow Democrats, demanding more legal rights for enemy combatants while his fellow progressive lawyers queued up from Harvard Yard to Guantanamo Bay to volunteer their services to those who'd been detained. After all, as they've told us for years, due process for the enemy is part of ""our values"" - it's ""who we are.""

But how about due process for their political adversaries? On that, Swalwell's interview last night by Fox's Martha MacCallum is a useful marker of how lunatic Democrats have become in the Trump era.

The congressman was asked about the implications of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's final report, which conclusively clears the president of ""collusion"" allegations first peddled by the Obama administration - allegations that, it is increasingly clear, were substantially based on a Clinton campaign opposition research document procured from a foreign operative and filled with sensational but unverified hearsay from anonymous foreign sources (purportedly including Russian officials).

ANDREW MCCARTHY: HOW LONG HAS MUELLER KNOWN THERE WAS NO TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION?

Specifically, Swalwell was asked if he stood by his slanderous claim that the president of the United States is a ""Russian agent,"" made two months ago in an MSNBC interview with Chris Matthews. It is worth watching the clip, played during the MacCallum interview. Just to make sure everyone understood the gravity of what was being alleged, Matthews emphatically repeats the term ""agent,"" and Swalwell reaffirms that, yes, Trump is an agent of Russia.

Maintaining his smarm while trying to deflect MacCallum's question, Swalwell played a couple of cutesy-pie lawyer games. First, he attempted to redefine ""agent."" The sense manifestly conveyed by his original defamatory claim was ""agent"" as an espionage term-of-art, referring to a clandestine operative. Now, however, we are to understand the congressman meant it almost benignly: agency as in ""just acting on someone's behalf"" - maybe coincidentally, perhaps not attuned to the elevation of Russia's interests over America's.

Second, asked about the dodgy dossier, Swalwell turned the tables and began to interrogate MacCallum rather than answer her questions. What part of the dossier, he demanded to know, had been disproved? (This echoed his risible explanation to Matthews that Trump was a Russian agent because Swalwell hadn't ""seen a single piece of evidence that he's not."")

It is good news for the White House and Republicans that Democrats continue doubling down on the indefensible. Two points, though, ought to be made here.

First, it is abundantly clear what Swalwell meant when he called Trump a Russian agent. At the time, the anti-Trump hopes for the Mueller probe were flying high, and the congressman was trying to be as razor's edgy as possible. When Trump was being described as a Russian agent, just like when the Obama Justice Department and the FBI branded former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page a Russian agent, the term had a very specific meaning. A foreign agent is a person who is knowingly engages in clandestine activities on behalf of a foreign power. Under our law, when the term is applied to an American citizen, ""clandestine activities"" means ""activities [which] involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States."" (FISA, section 1801(b)(2) - Title 50, U.S. Code.)

The congressman was not accusing the president of the United States merely of ""acting on Russia's behalf"" - it was not a matter of Trump happening to have the same position as Putin on NATO, as Swalwell ridiculously claimed last night (it would be truer to say that Putin and Obama had the same position on Iran, which never seemed to bother Swalwell). In calling Trump a Russian agent, Swalwell was effectively accusing the president of knowingly and secretly committing and planning to commit federal crimes in furtherance of Russia's interests. Espionage, the patent suggestion in Swalwell's accusation, is an egregious federal felony.

The Russian government is a murderous, anti-American regime - one of the most dangerous and capable in the world. If a president truly were a Russian agent, that president should not only be impeached and removed, but prosecuted and imprisoned. But to accuse a president of such a thing on scant evidence - actually, on partisan propaganda - is a disgrace. To persist in rationalizing the smear, now that it has been rejected after Mueller's lengthy, thorough investigation, is inexcusable.

From their perspective, there are plenty of things, personal and policy-wise, over which Democrats can feel good about opposing President Trump, with all the dudgeon and hyperbole that stamps our politics. The ""Russian agent"" claim, however, is a slander. It is too bad that Swalwell can't bring himself to apologize, but he should at least have the decency to retract it.

Second, as Swalwell would no doubt be the first to say if one of his own political allies was on the receiving end of libelous and criminal allegations, the burden of proof is on proponents of the dossier to prove the truth of its claims. In this country, you are not supposed to be able to make scandalous assertions and then dare skeptics to disprove them. The side relying on the claims has to verify them - particularly if the claims are used to obtain judicial warrants to spy and seize property.

It could be that I am just put off by the ""I'm a totally reasonable, bipartisan kinda guy"" veneer Swalwell assumes as he says totally unreasonable, rabidly partisan things. But it was tough to take his condescension when MacCallum tried to answer his challenge to refute the dossier. (I note in passing that Swalwell couldn't even get his set-up question right. Obviously meaning to ask MacCallum what part of the dossier had been disproved, Swalwell asked MacCallum, ""Which part of it hasn't been proved factual?"" Of course, virtually none of its significant allegations has been proved factual.)

MacCallum contended that, for example, the Michael Cohen Prague trip had been disproved. Oh, the congressman gleefully responded, well, if we believe Cohen about that, then we must also believe Cohen when he said Roger Stone gave Trump a heads-up that WikiLeaks was about to publish Democratic party emails. Mind you, (a) Mueller apparently believed Cohen on Prague but doubted him on Stone (neither allegation appears in the special counsel's many charging documents); and (b) House Democrats recently invited Cohen to testify at a hearing and, notwithstanding his multiple fraud and false statements convictions, repeatedly vouched for him. Perhaps Swalwell, who was a county district attorney for just a short time, was never trusted with a case involving a witness who lies about some things and tells the truth about others - though it is standard fare for prosecutors (and in everyday life).

But the point is, it was for those who proffered the dossier to verify the key ""collusion"" claim that Cohen was in Prague. It is not the burden of dossier naysayers to negate the allegation. And it is perfectly reasonable for naysayers to rely on a denial that Cohen has corroborated with his passport (which indicates no travel to the Czech Republic), coupled with the fact that if Cohen was in Prague when the dossier says he was, that would have been easy to verify. Swalwell can keep pretending that the dossier, which even Steele won't stand behind, is not a laughingstock, but it is he who looks absurd.

As a lawyer, Congressman Swalwell ought to be embarrassed. Alas, that doesn't appear to be in his repertoire.",26,Fox News,"Andrew McCarthy: Shameless Swalwell clings to dossier, libelous charge Trump is Russian 'agent'"

""Captain America"" star Chris Evans talked politics in a recent interview and said he ""really"" hopes the quarterback of his favorite team, Tom Brady, is not a supporter of President Trump.

Evans, 37, conducted a tell-all interview with The Hollywood Reporter that was published Wednesday. The discussion turned to politics when the issue of the actor's vocal political views on social media came up.

""You don't want to alienate half your audience,"" Evans told magazine of his tweets. ""But I'd be disappointed in myself if I didn't speak up. Especially for fear of some monetary repercussion or career damage -- that just feels really gross to me.""

The HR interview was conducted just days before the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams and won their sixth Lombardi Trophy. When asked about if he would ever consider playing the New England Patriots quarterback in a biopic, the ""Avengers: Endgame"" star was said to have looked ""grim"" at the mention of the athlete.

""I don't know,"" Evans told the outlet, speaking of Brady. ""I really hope he's not a Trump supporter. I'm just hoping he's one of those guys that maybe supported him and now regrets it. Maybe he thought it was going to be different -- and even that bothers me -- but maybe there's a chance now he just thinks Trump's an absolute dumb s---, which he is. If he doesn't, if he's still on that Trump train, I might have to cut ties. It's really tough.""

The actor continued to say that he hopes Brady has ""woken up.""

""I think maybe a couple of years ago,"" Evans said. ""I might have tried to pull some, like, mental gymnastics to compartmentalize, but I don't know if I can anymore. So I'm just hoping he's woken up.""

Evans, a native of Sudbury, Mass., is known to be a big Patriots fan who often attends NFL games to cheer on his team.

In 2015, a red Make America Great Again hat was spotted in Brady's locker during a televised interview.

Brady has been distancing himself from Trump since the 2016 election. In 2017, Brady declined to go to the White House after the Patriots won the Super Bowl.

Brady and Trump are reportedly friends and have played golf together in the past, but they don't see eye-to-eye on a key issue: kneeling during the national anthem. After Trump called the protests against police brutality against people of color unpatriotic, Brady said in an interview, ""I certainly disagree with what he said. I thought it was just divisive. Like I said, I just want to support my teammates.""

"With an already crowded 2020 presidential race, it may be hard for voters to keep the names of every candidate -- as well as their policies and platforms -- straight.

This may be an even more difficult task given many people frequently flub the pronunciation or spelling of the Democratic candidates' names. It's been such a source of confusion that some candidates and even their spouses have taken to social media or campaign videos to clarify.

WHO'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020? GROWING FIELD OF CANDIDATES JOIN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOD

Here's a quick guide to some of the most frequently mispronounced names in the 2020 field -- and how to say them correctly.

New York Magazine's The Cut wrote an article in March solely on the name of the openly gay Indiana mayor exploring a presidential run in 2020.

Buttigieg is even selling campaign swag with the label ""Boot Edge Edge"" to make things easier for constituents.

HICKENLOOPER TARGETS GREEN NEW DEAL AS 'UNACHIEVABLE'

Buttigieg's husband, Chasten, also gave supporters some ""options"" when it comes to pronouncing their surname.

""Boot-edge-edge or Buddha-judge or Boot-a-judge or Boo-tuh-judge,"" he wrote in a Dec. 17 tweet, which received hundreds of likes.

Castro is former President Barack Obama's U.S. housing chief and the previous mayor of San Antonio. As the grandson of a Mexican immigrant and twin son of a Latina activist, Castro said he is proud to represent the Latino community.

JULIAN CASTRO, FORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL, FORMS PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE

""I'm also very mindful, especially now for the Latino community, that there's a particular meaning to my candidacy,"" Castro said. ""We can't go through the 2020 cycle with nobody on that stage because of what's happened over the last couple of years,"" he said in December, as he launched a 2020 exploratory committee.

He says his first name with a soft Spanish J, which he explained in his memoir, he committed to officially in college.

As a freshman at Stanford University, Castro said he was shocked when students got the pronunciation of his name right on the first try.

""They pronounced it with a Spanish J and an emphasis on the a -- not 'JOO-lee-in,' but 'who-lee-AHN.' All through school, I'd grown up hearing the English-sounding Julian, even in Mexican American neighborhoods of San Antonio, and here in California, in a school with people from around the world, they nailed my name on the first try,"" he wrote, noting that he had an immense appreciation for the school's diversity.

""From then on, I always referred to myself as Juli√°n, never Julian,"" he continued.

Believe it or not, there's actually a Reddit thread that only discusses the pronunciation of the Hawaii congresswoman's last name.

""I'm a big fan of Tulsi, and when discussing politics I often bring her name into the conversation. However, I've recently heard a few people pronounce her last name as 'guh-BARD,' instead of 'GA-bird.' Which is correct for Tulsi? I don't want to look like an idiot here,"" one Redditor kicked off the conversation last year.

Her name is actually pronounced TUL-see Gab-bard.

Her first name is Hindu and refers to a ""holy basil plant,"" according to Slate.

When Gillibrand was named New York's senator in 2009, The New York Times wanted to ensure residents knew how to address her.

""It's a sibilant G ... JILL-uh-brand,"" an aide in her Hudson office told the newspaper back then.

""The vast majority of her constituents call her Kirsten -- it's very homey,"" the aide added. ""But you can mess that first name up, too. You can call her Kristen.""

According to the publication, many staff members at that time called Gillibrand by her initials: ""Keg.""

The California senator could make history if she wins the Democratic nomination and made it into the White House. She'd be the first female, first African American woman, the first Indian American and the first Asian American, according to The Washington Post.

""It's only been in the last year or so that she's really come out and embraced [her Indian heritage,"" Aziz Haniffa, executive editor of India Abroad, told the newspaper in February.

Her Indian first name, Kamala, translates to ""lotus flower,"" The Post noted.

In 2016, Harris posted a 20-second video clip to help people better understand how to say her name properly.

""People pronounce my name many different ways. Let #KidsForKamala show you how it's done,"" she tweeted at the time.

As Slate points out, the beginning of the Minnesota senator's name rhymes with ""blow.""

""That 'ch' is pronounced like an 'sh.' And in Minnesotan, the 'bush' is really quick,"" the Twin Cities Pioneer Press explained in a February article, adding that it's Slovenian.

A September 2018 YouTube video titled, ""How to Pronounce Beto O'Rourke,"" has been viewed nearly 60,000 times. The Houston Chronicle even wrote an Opinion piece on ""How to pronounce 'Beto,'"" at that time.

""You stress the first syllable, which is pronounced 'beh,' as in meh or heh. There is no 'y' or 'i' sound at the end of that 'e,'"" author Juan Ram√≥n Palomo stated in the piece.

Born Robert, the Texas representative says his nickname ""Beto"" is common in the Spanish community.

""From day one, in El Paso ... If you are born Robert ... your community calls you 'Beto,'"" he explained during a CNN town hall in Texas in October.",28,Fox News,"How to pronounce the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' names, from Buttigieg to Gillibrand"

BIDEN BUNGLES APOLOGY FOR SEXISM

AP: ""Former Vice President Joe Biden condemned 'a white man's culture' as he lashed out at violence against women and, more specifically, lamented his role in the Supreme Court confirmation hearings that undermined Anita Hill's credibility nearly three decades ago. Biden, a Democratic presidential prospect who often highlights his white working-class roots, said Hill, who is black, should not have been forced to face a panel of 'a bunch of white guys' about her sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas. 'To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,' he said Tuesday night... Biden's role in the 1991 Thomas confirmation hearings is among his many political challenges as he considers making a 2020 bid for the presidency. Should he run, he would be among a handful of white men in a Democratic presidential field that features several women and minorities.""

Harris flexes small-dollar fund-raising muscle - NYT: ""Over the last two years, Ms. [Kamala] Harris has systematically constructed a database of donors and email addresses that raised several million dollars for her fellow Democrats, demonstrating an uncommon potency for a first-term senator, according to federal election records and interviews with numerous political strategists. Now, as she makes her own run for president, her digital following serves as a kind of stealth weapon, putting her in perhaps the best position to challenge the small-dollar fund-raising operations of two top rivals, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Those two candidates outgunned every other 2020 Democratic candidate with their roughly $6 million hauls in the first day of fund-raising, besting Ms. Harris by 4 to 1. Ms. Harris raised $1.5 million, the next-highest total in the field, from more than 38,000 donors in the first 24 hours. In a campaign in which small donations have emerged as an early proxy for viability, Ms. Harris's team hopes her grass-roots appeal will allow her to compete at the highest level of American politics.""

Gillibrand makes 2018 taxes public - NYT: ""Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York disclosed on Wednesday that she earned about $218,000 last year through her congressional salary and a book deal, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to disclose her most recent tax returns and issuing a challenge to her rivals to do to the same. In a tax return shared with The New York Times, Ms. Gillibrand stated that she earned $167,634 from her salary and an additional $50,000 through a book that she reported as business income. She paid $29,170 in federal taxes. ... The release of Ms. Gillibrand's taxes may increase pressure on the other Democrats running for president to be open about their personal finances. With the exception of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has released a decade of her tax returns -- though not yet for 2018 -- none of the major Democratic presidential candidates has given the public more than a highly selective look at their personal taxes.""

Tim Ryan gets closer to 2020 decision - The [Youngstown] Vindicator: ""U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan said he's going to make a decision shortly on whether he'll run for president.

I'm a little concerned that I'm not hearing about jobs and health care and pensions. We're not hearing a lot about that. I think those are the most important messages. I'm also not hearing a lot about how we're going to be competitive as a country. We're so divided right now that the challenges are unbelievable coming from Russia, coming from China, economic challenges.'""

TRUMP'S $1 BILLION 2020 STRATEGY

Forbes: ""In the days preceding the official conclusion of the Mueller Report, Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, was on a trip to Romania, where he outlined a $1 billion dollar strategy to get the U.S. President re-elected in 2020. Parscale's visit was received with great public interest in this mostly pro-American country located on the European Union's Eastern border. Officially appointed at the helm of Trump's 2020 re-election efforts in 2018, Parscale had previously been in charge of the candidate's digital marketing efforts during the 2016 campaign. Parscale delivered a talk on Thursday at the Romanian Academy with the title 'Let's Make Political Marketing Great Again' in the presence of numerous personalities of Romania's political and academic elite. ... In this unlikely context so far from home, he shared fascinating details about the Trump campaign's plans to use 1.6 million volunteers in a data-driven, large-scale ground game operation to win the next Presidential election.""

Lawmakers intensified their demands for access to the special counsel's full report.

DEMS SEE LIFELINE IN TRUMP'S RENEWED OBAMACARE ATTACK

NYT: ""The Trump administration's decision to ask a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act has given House Democrats a new opening to pursue what they see as a winning political strategy: moving past talk of impeachment to put kitchen-table issues like health care front and center. The notice to the court, filed late Monday by the Justice Department, could not have come at a more opportune time for Democrats. ... Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who celebrated her 79th birthday on Tuesday -- had already planned to move to change the conversation with the unveiling of the Democrats' own health care plan on Tuesday. The Democrats' bill aims to lower health insurance premiums, strengthen protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and ban the sale of what Democrats call 'junk insurance.'

Both are close allies of White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who helped to engineer the move.

But he said that after meeting with various groups of House Democrats, 'I'm not particularly hopeful.' The divisions, which include disagreements about spending levels for the Pentagon, make it unlikely a budget resolution would pass on the House floor. Such a failure would be an embarrassment for the new majority and one Democratic leaders would rather avoid -- especially because a budget resolution is a largely symbolic document that serves mostly to lay out a party's priorities. ...

The Senate did not proceed to debating the measure, as 57 senators voted against it and 43 Democrats and independents who caucus with them -- nearly all of the Democratic caucus -- voted 'present.' Four senators who vote with Democrats -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama and independent Angus King of Maine -- voted against the resolution.

'I think this is such a dumb idea I don't think it's going to last long,' Pocan said in an interview. 'I think it was someone thinking they were being clever. ... I think it's a bad idea. I think it sends all kinds of wrong messages and doesn't accomplish anything they want to accomplish. I hope they'll revisit that idea in some way.' ...

Armed with a crossbow, the 57-year-old unnamed individual was spotted launching the jet ski off Punsand Bay, off the northern tip of Queensland, and was believed to have set his sights on Papua New Guinea. Australian police gave chase and eventually apprehended the man on mudflats near Saibai Island, just south of his intended destination. Saibai Island belongs to Australia but is only separated from PNG by a short channel of water less than 5 kilometers across. The island represented the fugitive's best chance of landfall, but authorities would no doubt have been alerted to his potential, though somewhat bizarre arrival.""

"DOJ sets timetable for release of Mueller report to Congress, public

Democrats have been building up the credibility and investigative professionalism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller for virtually two years. To maintain intellectual integrity, Democrats should now accept the conclusion as it relates to the seemingly defunct Russia-Trump conspiracy and focus on policy-related concerns.

In fact, this should have never simply been about Russian collusion but rather Russian interference with our most sacred civic duty - voting. Attorney General William Barr's rendition of Mueller's report concluded that Russia did in fact attempt to influence the presidential election, something President Trump still has a hard time believing.

MUELLER REPORT MAY BE GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS IN 2020

Many America-loving citizens sincerely believed that there was some level of criminal coordination with the Trump campaign and Russia. This is largely due to President Trump's insistent protection of Vladimir Putin and the obvious lies told by Trump surrogates to cover-up their meetings with known Russian operatives.

Today, President Trump continues to disregard findings from his own federal agencies as it relates to Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, even though one of those agencies just concluded Trump did not engage in a criminal conspiracy -- something Trump obviously agrees with.

Now Democrats are faced with an undeniable reality; they will have to work for their victories the old fashion way - electoral politics. It may sound clich√©, but the best way to defeat Trump is at the ballot box.

Even Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi decided to publicly back away from the impeachment narrative just days before the special counsel report concluded. This did not go unnoticed by mainstream media, and many saw this as a strategy shift.

Let's leave the court of law for just a moment and explore the court of common sense.

Understand Mueller's job was to simply investigate and bring facts to the prosecutor -- in this case Attorney General Barr. Even though Barr's summary report concludes that Mueller did not find evidence of criminal conspiracy with Russian operatives (which has been interchangeable with collusion), it is clear that Mueller left the door open for a possible obstruction of justice investigation.

Mueller knew that his decision to render an ""inconclusive"" finding would guarantee additional scrutiny from congressional oversight committees and possibly even other federal investigative agencies.

While this opening will be examined primarily through the lens of partisan politics, it does not mean there's nothing to investigate. If Republicans accept Mueller's findings on Russian collusion, they must also accept his findings on obstruction of justice.

According to Mueller, he cannot exonerate Trump from this possibility. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the criminal justice standard and the bar is high as to whether Trump and operatives knowingly crossed those lines with the appropriate end goal in mind (intent). Many times, prosecutorial discretion is utilized to bring charges only when the investigation yields enough evidence for a likely conviction in court.

Former FBI Director James Comey used similar logic as to why Hillary Clinton would not face charges for allegedly sending State Department emails from her private server.

Without the full Mueller report or an exhaustive congressional oversight hearing, we may never know the full background as to Robert Mueller's rationale for his conclusions.

Until (or unless) Robert Mueller's report becomes fully available, many will continue to distrust the current attorney general's summary. After all, we are accepting context from an AG who expressed explicit bias in favor of President Trump before being tapped for the position. The optics are just bad.

But once again, I caution Democrats not to hang their political hat on this investigation nor its findings. Mueller is not the answer; policy is. You don't need Mueller to fight for issues: citizens without control of healthcare expenses, kids in cages, increasing costs of higher education, immigration reform, Muslims being banned from traveling to America or the insidious reemergence of white nationalism.

Regardless of which side you're on as it relates to the aforementioned issues, we can all agree that these issues were here before Mueller's report and will be here long after.",30,Fox News,Mueller was never the answer for Democrats
"Cook County prosecutors in the Jussie Smollett case are facing backlash from law enforcement and the mayor's office; Matt Finn reports from Chicago.

Livid Chicago law enforcement officials are furious Jussie Smollett has had all 16 felony charges dismissed against him after he was accused of staging his own hate crime - and they smell a political rat.

""The Chicago Police Department is not happy. Our Superintendent expressed his displeasure about the charges being dropped,"" one officer in the Chicago Police Department told Fox News. ""The Department exhausted manpower and numerous hours investigating this case to make sure it was handled properly.""

The wiping of the case has been seen as nothing short of a ""real blow"" to those in Chicago's law enforcement. The department insider also noted that they have been left scratching their heads as to why the case was suddenly sealed, thus not allowing public scrutiny, and pointed to ""politics"" and questionable shuffles and possible interference in handling the case.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT HOAX CHARGES DROPPED, BUT FEDERAL INVESTIGATION, LAWSUITS COULD BE NEXT

""The police department worked super hard on this. They put a ton of manpower on it because they knew it sounded wrong from the beginning,"" another former Chicago-based law enforcement source said.

""What's interesting is that the former chief-of-staff of Michelle Obama called the state's attorney about the case, saying the (Smollett) family was concerned. Shortly after, the state's attorney recused herself and now the charges are dropped and the court has sealed the record.""

Reports emerged last week that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx had been in contact with Mrs. Obama's former chief-of-staff, Tina Tchen, who emailed her expressing the ""concerns"" that the Smollett family had about the ongoing investigation. Foxx is alleged to have then spoken with a Smollett relative whose number was provided by Tchen, and subsequently reached out to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.

RAHM EMANUEL CONSIDERS SUING JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO RECOUP MONEY WASTED ON INVESTIGATION: REPORT

Ahead of the charges being dropped, the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police President Kevin Graham alleged that Foxx may have interfered with the police probe and sought an investigation into whether Foxx herself had violated any laws.

Another retired police chief in the region told Fox News that politics has long plagued the Chicago judicial system.

""Politicians run for office promising to change the way things are done and this is what they do,"" he said. ""Policemen work their butts off to do a good job and this is what they get. The least a prosecutor could have done was to send it to the grand jury. It's no wonder policemen get discouraged.""

BRIAN STELTER CAUTIONED BY CNN COLLEAGUE STEVE CORTES: 'DON'T DISRESPECT THE COPS' IN SMOLLETT CASE

Johnson claims to have been blindsided by the sudden dropping of charges, and others connected to law enforcement officials in Chicago told Fox News that conflict between the DA and the PD could ""get pretty ugly.""

In late January, the black and openly gay actor told police that he was attacked by two men who jeered him with homophobic and racial epithets. While sympathy poured in for him from Hollywood and high-level advocacy organizations, skeptics also started to raise red flags. The two alleged assailants turned out to be brothers who previously worked with Smollett, and told investigators that they have been paid to assist in staging the incident.

Chicago's Cook County State's Attorney's Office did not specify if any information had arisen on the case, and simply stated that ""after reviewing all of the facts and circumstances, including Mr. Smollett's volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his [$10,000] bond, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to the case.""

Other less pronounced theories have emerged as to why the charges were abandoned, with some in the broader law enforcement community suggesting that presumptions of guilt put forth by state officials in recent weeks may have ""tainted the jury pool.""

At a press conference announcing the charges in February, Superintendent Johnson chided Smollett, questioning how an African-American man could use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations"" and mandated that ""bogus police reports cause real harm."" But both Johnson and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel doubled-down and again came out lambasting the actor for his ""hoax"" on Tuesday after the charges were tossed.

""Police should never be conducting press conferences where they convict an individual of wrongdoing because that is not their job,"" said Joe Ested, a former law enforcement official and author of ""Police Brutality Matters.""

""The job of law enforcement is to gather all evidence and present it to the prosecutor. When you hear of a dismissal of this nature, it usually comes from improper police procedures or misconduct somewhere during the evidence gathering.

"Senator Kamala Harris has proposed a $315 billion program to raise teachers' salaries by $13,500. There is nothing quite as fine to the worst kind of politician as buying an election with someone else's money. Given that teachers' unions are the financial bedrock of Democratic campaigns -- together the NEA and the AFT were the third-largest spender in politics, and they donate almost exclusively to Democrats, with most of that money derived from dues deducted from teacher salaries -- this is the Democrats voting tax dollars into their own political coffers, world-class log rolling.

That aside, it's also lousy policy.

Dozens of academic studies over the years have failed to establish any consistent link between changes to teachers' pay and students' educational outcomes. The most reasonable interpretation of those data is that teachers' compensation already is well above whatever hypothetical point it would need to be raised to for educational purposes. But Senator Harris frames this instead as a question of social justice.

That's a peculiar way of looking at it. The average teacher's individual compensation slightly exceeds the median household income of the United States; two married people each earning the average teacher's pay would have a joint income placing them at the 90th income percentile. Households in the top 10 percent are not the most obvious cases of economic marginalization.

Senator Harris and others complain that teachers have lagged in compensation when compared with those who have similar education and experience, by which they mean college degrees and years of service. But this is a case of conflating credentials with education: Undergraduates entering colleges of education in pursuit of teaching careers reliably have the lowest test scores and grades of students in any major; a master's degree in education is by no means comparable to a master's degree in, say, electrical engineering, and doctorates in education are basically clipped from the backs of cereal boxes.

Even if such degrees were intellectually comparable, that would have little bearing on their economic value: Professors of art make substantially less money than professors of finance not because art is less valuable than banking but because finance professors have many high-paying alternatives to teaching, and professors of art have Starbucks.

Senator Harris might have proposed a $315 billion program focused on -- imagine! -- students. But students mostly are not old enough to vote, and they make very few campaign contributions.

Public schools are run largely at the local level, and for good reason. Decisions about compensation and other factors relating to teachers' work belong at the local level, too -- because that is where there is the most ready and direct democratic accountability. The Democrats' push to federalize everything from policing practices to cow ponds to teachers' salaries runs contrary to local democratic accountability and is part of an effort to centralize power in Washington for purely political purposes.

The Democrats have for more than a generation resisted every substantive attempt at reforming the public schools, especially in Democrat-dominated places such as New York City and Cleveland, where the public schools are failures overall and catastrophic failures for the poor, African Americans, and Latinos. They have fought school choice, targeted assistance for grossly neglected communities, accountability measures, and more -- all while their most important political constituents were busily engaged in standardized-test fraud for students and professional-certification fraud for themselves. The system is dysfunctional, and Senator Harris proposes to shovel money into the fire.

Consider the African-American dropout rate in Wisconsin, where the Democrats will be holding their convention in 2020: More than a third of the state's black students fail to graduate from high school. At Milwaukee's North Division High School, nearly 40 percent of the students are absent on any given day, fewer than a third graduate in four years, and the ACT math proficiency rate is 0.0 percent. There are many reasons for this, but it seems unlikely that the average total compensation for a Milwaukee public-school teacher -- more than $100,000 a year -- is prominent among them.

Funny thing about big money in politics. The truth isn't the story you usually hear from the Democrats and their media allies: With more than $40 million in combined 2018 giving, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers were jointly the third-largest donor of the last election cycle. That is not unusual for them. Overall, they are the largest long-term source of political donations for Democrats. Those big-money malefactors you're always hearing about from the likes of Senator Harris have in reality nowhere near as big a financial footprint in politics: Koch Industries is way down the list at No. 30, the Club for Growth at No. 37, and the almighty National Rifle Association at . . . No. 517. If you're wondering what kind of political clout buys you a $315 billion windfall, that's it.

There are good teachers and bad teachers, underpaid teachers and overpaid teachers. Senator Harris's scheme has nothing to do with any of those issues, which are best addressed at the local level. Her proposal is not at heart about education at all. It's an opening bid for the 2020 Democratic primary, and a high one.",32,nationalreview.com,Kamala Harris's Teacher-Pay Plan: Adventures in Log-Rolling | National Review
"The matriarch of the Bush dynasty, the wife of one president (George H.W. Bush, who died in November of last year) and the mother of another (George W. Bush), passed away in April of last year at the age of 92 after a years-long fight with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Nevertheless, in June of 2016, Trump gave her a heart attack -- sorry, I mean, a ""heart attack.""

Barbara Bush blamed Donald Trump for her heart attack.

It wasn't technically a heart attack, though she called it that. It was a crisis in her long battle with congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease that hit her like a sledgehammer one day in June 2016. An ambulance was called to take her to the hospital. The two former presidents who had been at home with her that day, her husband and her oldest son, trailed in a car driven by the Secret Service. The tumultuous presidential campaign in general and Trump's ridicule of son Jeb Bush in particular had riled her. ""Angst,"" she told me.

Afterward, Jeb, whose presidential campaign was already history, urged her to let it go, to focus on herself and have faith in the country.

""There's just a lot of angst"" among those distressed by President Trump's leadership, Jeb Bush told me, using the same word that his mother had used. ""So I think one of the solutions is don't watch it; don't obsess.""

""Jeb said, 'Mom, don't worry about things you can't do anything about,' "" Barbara Bush recalled. ""He's right. Just do good, make life better for someone else.""

This is an excerpt from Susan Page's upcoming biography, The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty, published Wednesday by the far-left USA Today.

And it's fake news.

As you can see, the headline debunks itself in the next sentence. On top of that, Bush was 90 or 91 at the time and already sick with COPD ... but we gotta sell some books, smear Trump, keep the hate campaign against the president going....

This particular anecdote is also deeply unflattering to Mrs. Bush.

By this time, Jeb(!) had already dropped out of his hapless low-energy bid for the 2016 Republican nomination, so why would a 90-year-old woman who had already been through four decades of the political wringer allow a presidential primary, allow a Donald Trump, allow anything other than a family crisis to discombobulate her to where she had a fake heart attack?

There's more...

When asked in February of 2018 if she was still a Republican,. She said, ""I'd probably say no today.""

And then there's this...

""I woke up and discovered, to my horror, that Trump had won.""

She didn't hide her horror from those close to her. After Trump was elected, a friend in Kennebunkport gave her a Trump countdown clock as a joke. The red, white, and blue digital clock displayed how many days, hours, minutes and seconds remained in Trump's term. She parked it on the side table in her bedroom, next to the chair she would sit in to needlepoint or watch television.

She liked the countdown clock so much that when the Bushes returned to Houston that October, she brought it with her. It sat on her bedside table, where she could see it every day. It was there to the day she died.

You know, I have no idea how I'm going to exit this life. I might be found under a stripper covered in cocaine dust or buried under all the cans of food amassed in my doomsday prepping, but I sure as hell know how I'm not going out -- and that's while obsessing to the point of fake heart attacks over politics, or who's president, or glued to the criminal stupidity of cable news.

Barbara Bush literally had everything -- a fairytale marriage, wealth, success, a place in history, a tight-knit family, countless grandkids and great-grandkids... And still.

You have almost have to feel some pity for someone buried in monetary and familial wealth who still allows a politician to undermine her peace of mind, to in any way affect what should have been the most contented winter years imaginable.

Honestly, Barbara Bush always struck me as a much stronger woman than this, someone with poise and self-control. Even more surprising is that she would admit to such a thing. If that were me, I would at least have the self-respect to keep something so embarrassing to myself.",33,Breitbart,Nolte: Barbara Bush Blamed Trump for Her 'Heart Attack'
"The future? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kdRdzxdZQ""Wall-E screen grab from Food Juggler)

Ben Stoeber played two years of tennis for Pinckney High School.

This year, he's trading in his racket for a mouse and the court for a video screen.

And he's more nervous now than he ever was wearing a Pinckney tennis uniform.

The junior is a member of the school's first esports team, which began its season Feb. 18 in a 48-team league sponsored by Lawrence Tech University.

""There's a couple players on the team who played traditional sports here before this year,"" Stoeber said. ""I'm nervous. There's more pressure on us than in tennis. It's our first year of esports, so if we don't do well, who knows if there will be another year.

So this kid left his body, and now lives inside his head.

What a tragedy this is! I'm serious. I say this as a 52-year-old man who is trapped living inside his head, and wishes he had developed the habits as a young man of living otherwise.

There is this sort of prejudice technophiles have that sees all activity as of equal value. No, sorry, that's not true. A kid playing video game tennis is not doing the same thing as a kid who picks up a racket and swings it, and sweats. I would not go so far as to say that physical labor is more valuable than cognitive labor -- we need both, actually -- but it is certainly true that doing work with your body (or playing games with your body) is a phenomenologically different thing than doing it with your head.

The book to read about this is Matthew Crawford's The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming An Individual In An Age Of Distraction (2015). In it, the philosopher talks about how the way we live -- increasingly abstracted from the physical world -- reflects early Enlightenment views of human nature. When we remove ourselves from the physical world and retreat into our heads -- as these young people are doing -- we habituate ourselves to a false narrative about who we are, and what we are. We also become weaker, more subject to authoritarian rule.

Here's an excerpt from a 2015 interview National Review's Ian Tuttle did with Crawford about his book:

TUTTLE: Your book is political philosophy, but you are not above engaging the grubby world of politics. Both Left and Right (libertarians, Tea Partiers, and Mitt Romney) come in for criticism. While we often hear about the polarization of American politics, it seems you might be suggesting that both sides share troubling philosophical commitments. Is that right?

Crawford: There do seem to be some affinities. Both invoke ""choice"" as a content-free meta-good that bathes every actual choice made in the softly egalitarian, flattering light of autonomy.

Here's another. The ongoing ""creative destruction"" of capitalism celebrated on the Right clears away settled forms of social life. Cultural progressives find their work made easier by this; they get to re-engineer the human landscape with less interference. They do this by moving the threshold of offense ever lower, creating new sensitivities and then policing them. The institutions of civil society (universities, corporations, etc.) then scramble to catch up with the new dispensation and demonstrate their allegiance to it -- by expanding their administrative reach into ever more intimate corners of the psyche. This dynamic has given us a stunning expansion of coercive power over the individual, but it has nothing to with ""the government.""

While we're scrambling ideological divisions, allow me to make a suggestion: Marx is due to be discovered by conservatives. Seriously. Not the positive, utopian program, obviously. But the critical part. Arguably, Marx was a conservative, initially. Read the 1844 Manuscripts -- much of it is straight out of Aristotle. I am not the first to notice this. His account of what we require to flourish is rooted in the idea that there is a distinctly human form of activity, one that answers to our ""species nature."" We're the kind of creatures who need to see our own thought manifested concretely in the world, through productive activity. It may well be that no viable form of large-scale economic organization can take this as its guiding insight, but I think the perspective Marx offers is timely, and can cast new light on what we are doing to ourselves. With the Cold War now decided, I think we can safely start to ease our way out of certain intellectual habits that arose from our defensive posture against the Soviet threat, and take a more cold-eyed look at the trajectory of our own economy. In thinking about economics, conservatives would do well to recover the more tragic view of the human condition that is part of their tradition, and a more pessimistic take on history, as against triumphant neoliberal enthusiasms.

TUTTLE: Re-engaging with ""the world beyond our heads,"" you contend, can put democracy on a firmer foundation. How so?

Crawford: That's in the final pages where I suggest that an aristocratic ethos needn't be thought threatening, that it can in fact strengthen democratic solidarity and place it on a more real psychological footing. Our attraction to excellence -- our being on the lookout for the choicer manifestations -- may lead us to attend to human practices searchingly, and to find superiority in unfamiliar places. For example, in the embodied cognitive finesse of the short-order cook, or the intense intellectual labor that may be required in work that is dirty, such as that of the mechanic when he is diagnosing a problem. With such discoveries we extend our moral imagination to people who are conventionally beneath serious regard, and find them admirable. Not because we heed a moral demand such as the egalitarian lays upon us, but because we actually see something admirable. Our openness to superiority is what connects us to others in a genuine way, without a screen of abstraction.

By contrast, egalitarian empathy, projected from afar and without discrimination, is more principled than attentive. It is content to posit rather than to see the humanity of its beneficiaries. But the one who is on the receiving end of such empathy wants something more than to be recognized generically. He wants to be seen as an individual, and recognized as worthy on the same grounds on which he has striven to be worthy, indeed superior, by cultivating some particular excellence or skill. We all strive for distinction, and I believe that to honor another person is to honor this aspiring core of him.

It is interesting to contemplate the implications here for our democracy in what Crawford is saying. If I'm reading him correctly, he indicates that by living mostly inside our own heads, we lose a sense of reality, and what living within reality requires of us politically. The engagement of our attention by an artificial world inevitably forms us in ways that are antithetical to true liberty. Put simply, who is likely to be a better subject of authoritarian control: the boy who plays tennis, or the boy who sits all day in front of a screen playing an electronic simulation of tennis?

It's not a silly question. Crawford says in his book that immersion in technology conditions us to expect that we can control the world beyond our heads, and never have to encounter anything that we have not chosen to encounter. This is not how reality works, and if we allow ourselves to be seduced by a politics based on how technocracy forms our understanding of what man is, and what mankind is together, we are going to make terrible mistakes.

Lest you think I'm being a nanny here, let me assure you that I'm accusing myself of having screwed up on this front. I think of my own childhood, of my father constantly telling me to get my head out of a book, and to look around me at the world, and to engage with it. My dad was brilliant, but not an intellectual; in fact, he hated intellectuals. I honestly can't say to what extent my resisting his attempts to get me into the world beyond my head was about a character flaw within me, or it was about him pushing too hard for me to do something that went against my nature. Had my dad not been so pushy about it, or if he had tried more gently to introduce me into nature, or if he had ever shown interest in the books and ideas that captivated me as a child, maybe I would have been different. Or not. I'll never know.

But I can say that I regret having decided so early to retreat inside my head. I did it in part because the world beyond my head was dominated by my father, who was very strong and adept at manipulating that world. There was nothing he couldn't do, it seemed. I hid in books and ideas -- and, when they were invented, video games -- because there I was the master, and he was not. I was not athletically inclined; he had been a good athlete, and forced athletics on me as a kid, even though they made me miserable. I tell you all this as background for why I got so bound up inside my head, and why as I've gotten older, it has become even harder to leave that sacred grove, to my displeasure.

I was worried that my oldest child, who is so like me in many ways, was going down the same path. When he lived with us at home, he stayed deep inside his head, even more than I had been, because he did not have a father who forced him to do physical activity. So he went off to college last autumn, and somehow, discovered the joy of biking. Now he's a passionate cyclist. Last month, I was on campus and met him for dinner at a pub that was my hangout when I was his age, at LSU like him. The drinking age was 18 in Louisiana then, and I spent a goodly portion of my freshman year downing pitchers of beer there. Well, my son shows up, and it struck me how fit he had become since leaving home. It's all because of cycling. He told me he had lost 20 pounds. Dang! See, by this point in my freshman year, I had gained 20 pounds, from all the beer. And he's telling me he lost it because he cycles so much.

I'm really proud of him, and more than proud, happy for him -- because he found a way to break out of his head. See, I read the story about the gamer kid giving up tennis to play video games competitively, and I see a boy who has resigned himself to a kind of prison. It's not that it's always wrong to play video games; it's that he has chosen to leave behind an activity in which he used his body to retreat into a world in which the only part of his body he uses is the twitch of his wrist and finger. This can't be progress.

I found myself thinking this morning about the tennis kid who has surrendered to technology and the Pixar film Wall-E, which is a parable set in a future dystopia in which mankind has alienated himself from his true nature by creating technology that enslaves him to machines, and allows him essentially to live without going beyond his head. Most of the action is set aboard the Axiom, a 28th-century spaceship that has been a kind of Noah's Ark for humans escaping the wreck they have made of Earth. Take a look at this clip, showing what existence has become for humans aboard the consumerist, technocratic utopia:

I wrote a commentary on the film on my old Beliefnet blog, but it has disappeared from that site. I found these fragments elsewhere. Here's what I wrote back in 2008:

What I found especially interesting about this epilogue is how it showed the robots from the Axiom helping humans rebuild civilization. See, ""Wall-E"" is not a Luddite film. It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature -- that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along. Where humanity got into trouble was allowing technology to exacerbate its own internal disorder -- to alienate people from their labor, from each other, and ultimately from themselves. The film is wise enough to know that we can't go back to a pre-technology state, so it says the best thing to do is to put technology in its proper place -- which we can only do when our own souls and communities are rightly ordered.

""Wall-E"" says that humans have within themselves the freedom to rebel, to overthrow that which dominates and alienates us from our true selves, and our own nature. But you have to question the prime directive; that is, you have to become conscious of how they way you're living is destroying your body and killing your soul, and choose to resist. ""Wall-E"" contends that real life is hard, real life is struggle, and that we live most meaningfully not by avoiding pain and struggle, but by engaging it creatively, and sharing that struggle in community. It argues that rampant consumerism, technopoly and the exaltation of comfort is causing us to weaken our souls and bodies, and sell out our birthright of political freedom. Nobody is doing this to us; we're doing it to ourselves. It is the endgame of modernity, which began in part with the idea that Nature is the enemy to be subdued -- that man stands outside of Nature, and has nothing to learn about himself from Nature's deep logic.

If Wendell Berry made a sci-fi movie for kids, it would be ""Wall-E."" I'm very eager to hear what the rest of you have to say about it. I notice Julie and I are already starting to critique our own daily behavior and choices by saying, ""That's like on the Axiom."" Saying, ""We're on the Axiom!"" is our way of taking note of our own mindless consumerism.

I wrote elsewhere:

In another twist on the Genesis story, ""Wall-E"" contends that what makes us human is labor. In the film's most meaningful iconic image, the Tree of Life on the new earth grows out of an old work boot. You'll recall that when Adam and Eve were cast out of Eden, Adam was cursed for his sin by being condemned to draw his sustenance from the very Earth from which he was drawn. God says to Adam, ""In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."" (Gen. 3:19) In ""Wall-E,"" humanity discovers that it can only complete its own given nature through labor -- first agricultural labor, then the labor of building cities.

Please, Ben Stoeber, pick your tennis racket back up! You don't have to quit playing video games, but make them secondary to your life. Watch Wall-E and think about the choice you're making (and more than Ben: teachers, coaches, principals, and parents, think hard about what you're doing to make it so much easier for young people to choose to live more and more inside their own heads). Here's the final credit sequence of the movie -- the epilogue to which I refer above. It shows how a future humanity recovers from a catastrophe caused by creating machines so good that they allow people to live completely inside the world of their heads. It doesn't destroy the machines, but makes them work subject to helping humans fulfill their nature. Watch:",34,The American Conservative,"Tennis, Technocracy & Servitude"

MICHAEL AVENATTI 'NERVOUS,' 'SCARED' ABOUT PROSPECT OF PRISON TIME, LABELS NIKE EXTORTION ALLEGATIONS 'ABSURD'

""As alleged, Michael Avenatti approached Nike last week with a list of financial demands in exchange for covering up allegations of misconduct on behalf of the company,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge William Sweeney Jr. said in a statement.

""The lofty price tag included a $1.5 million payoff for Avenatti's client and upwards of tens of millions of dollars for the legal services of his firm - services Nike never requested. This is nothing more than a straightforward case of extortion""

On the same day as the Nike case, he was charged with wire fraud and bank fraud in a separate case out of California.

The latest lawsuits against Avenatti mark the end of attempts to rehabilitate his reputation in the public eye that included taking up high-profile cases like the one against R&B star R. Kelly in an effort to move away from the shadow of controversy and redeem himself as a lawyer who holds the powerful accountable.

But Avenatti continues to grapple with the fallout stemming from accusations of domestic violence, along with mounting legal and financial problems.

He first entered the spotlight in March of last year as Stormy Daniels' lawyer, appearing on CNN and MSNBC hundreds of times in just two months, often on issues not related to the case.

MICHAEL AVENATTI'S RISE AND FALL: FROM MEDIA DARLING AND POTENTIAL 2020 CANDIDATE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARREST

He used the national spotlight as a springboard to build a following and openly float the possibility of running for president in 2020 as the Democratic candidate, starting a now-largely-defunct PAC. He even toured across the U.S., visiting early primary states such as New Hampshire and Iowa, raising speculation that he was actually serious about his run.

But then an avalanche of controversies hit the lawyer, who has maintained his innocence at all times while issuing increasingly conspiratorial claims that he was being targeted over his politics and opposition to Trump.

Avenatti was first hit with two criminal investigation referrals for his role in pushing the allegations against Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh, with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley directly accusing Avenatti of conspiring to provide false statements to Congress.

Those statements stem from his representing Julie Swetnick, who said Kavanaugh took part in ""gang"" and ""train"" rapes at parties in high school, allegations so outlandish that even Swetnick had to retract key claims - all while saying Avenatti ""twisted"" her words for publicity.

Then came the allegations of domestic violence in November, when actress Mareli Miniutti claimed Avenatti dragged her by the arm across the floor of his apartment after an argument.

Avenatti maintained his innocence and suggested politics were behind the accusations. Despite repeating such claims multiple times, he never produced evidence showing how his ex-girlfriend's accusations were politically motivated.

MICHAEL AVENATTI ACCUSED OF TRYING TO EXTORT NIKE FOR UP TO $25M, FEDS SAY

Similarly, he suggested politics were behind the latest accusations in relation to the bank and wire fraud case in California, where he's facing 50 years if convicted.

The fallout after the domestic violence accusations was immediate. Democratic groups, which apparently saw an opportunity in associating with the firebrand lawyer who could prove to be an effective anti-Trump messenger, began quickly breaking from him and canceled speaking invitations.

Shortly after that, Avenatti announced the end of his possible bid for the Democratic Party's nomination in 2020.

Authorities in Los Angeles opted out in February against formally charging the lawyer over the alleged abuse of the woman, though left a window open amid the hearings on the case.

At the same time, Avenatti was facing financial problems and accusations of illegally withholding settlement funds in a ""Ponzi-like"" scheme and then repeatedly lying about it.

PROSECUTORS DECLINE TO CHARGE MICHAEL AVENATTI ON ABUSE CLAIM: REPORT

Financial documents reviewed by Fox News showed that the funds pursuant to a settlement agreement were wired to an account designated by Avenatti while the lawyer continued to dodge the client's questions about where the funds were.

The client, Gregory Barela, outlined the charges in a statement of claims against Avenatti filed with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), a private entity that, as opposed to a trial court, has jurisdiction over the complaint pursuant to the lawyer-client agreement between Barela and Avenatti.

The allegations in the statement, which were first reported by the Daily Beast, include that Barela relied on relatively modest ""advances"" of funds from Avenatti to make ends meet while he awaited the settlement funds.

Despite all the controversies, Avenatti remained defiant that he'll overcome the challenges and come out on top, once again embraced by the media and higher echelons of the society.

But the latest charges in California and New York may have particularly struck a nerve. Avenatti sounded somewhat defeatist during a recent interview when he admitted that he's ""nervous"" and ""scared"" about potentially being put behind bars.

""No, and any suggestion is absolutely absurd,"" he told CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan when asked if he tried to extort money from the sports company.

"U.S. geopolitical power needs a steady supply of fresh immigrants to serve as soldiers and workers, according to a pro-migration op-ed in Bloomberg news.

""A large working-age population serves as a source of military manpower,"" says the op-ed by Hal Brands, the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. He continues:

... a relatively young, growing and well-educated population is a wellspring of the economic productivity that underlies other forms of international influence ... countries with healthy demographic profiles can create wealth more easily than their competitors [and] can also can direct a larger share of that wealth to geopolitical projects as opposed to pensions and health care.

Brands acknowledges -- but denounces -- the reality that immigration is largely unpopular among the voters who suffer from the resulting diversity, elite disengagement, job theft, and wage loss. That turmoil helped outsider Donald Trump win the White House in 2016. Brands dismisses the public's measured response as ""draconian ... xenophobia ... race-based politics,"" and says:

... if current trends are any indication, the U.S. could easily squander its demographic advantages [over China and Russia] by enacting draconian immigration restrictions or simply destroying its image as a country that welcomes ambitious newcomers. Conversely, if the proportion of immigrants continues to rise while the white population shrinks, xenophobia and race-based politics could become more common and more toxic.

After making these dire predictions, Brands declines to offer the public anything in exchange for the diversity, political divisions, taxpayer costs, and wage losses caused by the government policy of ""refreshing the population"":

If the U.S. is to keep its demographic edge, it will have to find ways of reconciling two competing imperatives: refreshing the population through immigration while preserving social and political stability.

Brands dismisses the public's expectation that their government serves citizens and their children, and he instead echoes the 1960s demand that Americans must give up their homeland to become a ""nation of immigrants"" to help beat Russian communism.

In an October 2018 article for Time magazine, Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy explained the government-boosting origin of the ""Nation of Immigrants"" claim:

Few felt it as deeply as President John F. Kennedy. In his 1964 book A Nation of Immigrants, recently re-released, my great-uncle outlines the compelling case for immigration, in economic, moral, and global terms. ""The abundant resources of this land provided the foundation for a great nation,"" he writes. ""But only people could make the opportunity a reality. Immigration provided the human resources.""

Both Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush strongly favored this cheap labor, high growth policy. In 1990, the first President Bush signed a bill doubling legal immigration, and in 2006 and 2007, George W. Bush pushed for a bill that would have further increased immigration.

In March 2019, the George W. Bush center released a video which effectively wrote Americans out of their own nation, while urging more immigration to spur national economic growth by reducing wages. ""America's story is an immigrant story,"" says the video. ""Now as before, American is a nation of immigrants,"" says the video which refers to 280 million Americans as the ""population,"" ""labor force,"" ""workers,"" and even ""natives.""

Brands' pitch, however, ignores the recent report by President Donald Trump's economic advisors which said the nation can continue to grow without an extra supply of foreign workers.

There are ""plenty of [American] workers on the sidelines able to come off"" and fill jobs in the growing economy, said Rich Burkhauser, a member of Trump's Council of Economic Advisors. Americans' productivity is rising and more sidelined Americans are returning to the workforce as wages rise, said the report, titled, ""Economic Report of the President.""

Investors and CEOs are increasingly desperate for an infusion of more foreign workers to lower the marketplace pressure for wage increases during 2019.

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019, because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts, the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 Central American laborers into the U.S. job market, even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

Overall, in 2019, the U.S. government will allow at least two million new foreign workers into the United States to compete for the starter jobs sought by the latest wave of four million U.S. graduates. The new migrants also undermine the 24 million other Americans and the roughly three million legal immigrants who have joined the workforce since 2014.",37,Breitbart,"Bloomberg: Immigrant Soldiers, Workers Needed for Geopolitical Power"
"KIEV, Ukraine - As Ukraine's presidential election draws near, its ultranationalist groups are becoming increasingly visible, posing a dilemma for the West.

Thousands of far-right activists marched to incumbent President Petro Poroshenko's administration headquarters earlier this month, chanting about alleged corruption and throwing funeral-style bouquets and toy pigs to symbolize the embezzlement of state funds. Ultranationalists have also gone to campaign rallies where they fight with police and heckle Poroshenko, who is running for a second five-year term in the March 31 presidential election. And earlier this month, the ambassadors of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations sent a letter to the Interior Ministry voicing concern about the ultra-right's assertive posturing ahead of Sunday's presidential vote.

The protests reflect the growing presence of far-right groups in Ukraine and their power in shaping the nation's political agenda, leaving the West in a quandary. On the one hand, the ultranationalists have played a key role in fighting Russia-backed separatist rebels in the east and are now challenging government corruption. On the other, they are pushing with increasing boldness for changes that go against traditional democratic ideals.

In a series of violent actions that underline their strength, right-wing radicals in recent years have assaulted gatherings by LGBT and women's rights activists, attacked Roma encampments around the country, derailed a lecture on the history of the Holocaust and brawled with pro-Russia veterans. The ultra-right groups also have a strict, military-style structure, and many of their members have battlefield experience from years of fighting in the east.

While the far-right groups have so far failed to unite behind a single presidential candidate, they have gained growing clout, with the government reluctant to challenge them. Andriy Biletsky, the leader of the National Corps, one of the most visible ultra-right groups, predicted that the nationalists ""will become the backbone of civil defense in Ukraine.""

Andriy Yermolayev, the head of the New Ukraine independent thinktank, said the government in the past had turned a blind eye to the rise of nationalist groups, using them as a scare tactic. He added that now the ultra-right has turned on the authorities.

""The well-organized and aggressive nationalism in Ukraine is a child of the government,"" Yermolayev said. ""The government has lost control over radical nationalists. Poroshenko has lost that game.""

The government has also been beset by allegations of corruption, after a journalistic investigation linked Poroshenko's top associate and an arms factory he controls to alleged embezzlement in the defense sector. The president denied any wrongdoing and ordered an official probe into the claims.

The country's ultranationalist groups came to the fore in 2014, when they spearheaded massive street protests that led to the ouster of Russia-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and backing separatists in the east, moves that drew Western sanctions. Thousands of Ukrainian nationalists then headed to the east, forming volunteer battalions that served as a vanguard for the Ukrainian forces in the rebel regions.

Since then, the influence of nationalist groups has steadily grown, driven by public dismay over the country's economic woes and rampant corruption. Mostly teenage members of the ultra-right groups have followed the guidance of war veterans, practicing martial arts and learning how to handle weapons. The number of ultra-nationalists is estimated at about 10,000, and they can quickly take thousands to the streets and resort to violence.

""They have undergone organizational, military and ideological training,"" Yermolayev said. ""They are strongly motivated and active.""

Torch-bearing ultra-right activists regularly march to the beat of drums across the downtown Ukrainian capital, chanting ""Death to Traitors of Ukraine!"" During one scuffle at the memorial to a Red Army general killed in WW II, an elderly woman approached a group of radical nationalists shouting ""Hang the Russians!"" and defied them, saying: ""I'm Russian, hang me!"" One of the right-wingers, Kiryl Nedin, pushed her back and was briefly detained for resisting police.

At one demonstration, Yevhen Karas, the leader of C14, a highly visible nationalist group, boasted of the growing power of the ultra-right.

""Of all the political parties in Ukraine, I think, no one (except us) can gather so many people, who sincerely and regularly will come to protests and actions,"" he said.

International human rights groups have strongly criticized the Ukrainian government for failing to track down and punish those responsible for the acts of violence and intimidation. The government has promised to rein in the ultranationalists, but has taken no action.

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the right-wing organizations will be stopped.

""They all know it very well,"" he said. ""And... there will be no amnesty for them.""

The Ukrainian ultra-right argues that the nationalist ideology will eventually prevail not only in Ukraine but across Europe as well. A growing nationalist wave has taken hold in Europe, with populist governments in countries like Hungary and Poland and an increased presence of the far-right Alternative for Germany party in Germany's politics.

Miroslav Mares, an expert on right-wing extremist groups at Brno University, said Ukraine's far right has been successful in reaching out to ultranationalist forces in Europe.

""They have good relations to some neo-Nazi groupings in Central and Eastern Europe,"" Mares said. He added that early in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, some members of Europe's neo-Nazi groups trained and fought with the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian ultra-right paramilitary group created by Biletsky that advocated white supremacist views.

The Ukrainian far right also appears to have ties in other countries. Australian Brenton Tarrant, accused of slaughtering 50 people at two mosques in the city of Christchurch in New Zealand, mentioned a visit to Ukraine in his manifesto, and some reports alleged that he had contacts with the ultra-right. The Soufan Center, a research group specializing on security, has recently alleged possible links between Tarrant and the Azov Battalion.

Yermolayev, the political analyst, noted that a violent image projected by Ukrainian nationalists could serve as an argument for those in the European Union who are reluctant about putting Ukraine on a membership track any time soon.

"Chicago's mayor blasts decision to drop Jussie Smollett charges

The shocking announcement that the 16 criminal charges previously made against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett had been dropped may have reinforced many people's negative assumptions about the criminal justice system in the U.S., the Federalist publisher Ben Domenech suggested Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the Cook County (Ill.) State's Attorney's office declared that while Smollett wasn't exonerated for allegedly staging a hate crime, his case was dismissed and the evidence remained sealed. In remarks to reporters, Smollett maintained his innocence, telling the world he was ""truthful"" since day one.

JUDGE NAP ON PROSECUTORS DROPPING CHARGES AGAINST JUSSIE SMOLLETT: 'ALMOST UNHEARD-OF'

During Tuesday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" Domenech -- along with ""The Next Revolution"" host Steve Hilton and the Cook Report national editor Amy Walter -- weighed in on the fallout of the dramatic plot twist in the Smollett case.

""This is a situation that has to damage your faith in the judicial system,"" Domenech told the panel. ""The truth is that, in this context, I think in Chicago, in the Illinois context, this is kind of a battle between Kim Foxx, who had to recuse herself from her position on this investigation at the State's Attorney's office, and the Chicago Police Department.

""I think this was clearly something that internal politics played a role here,"" he continued. ""Keep in mind that 18 people were killed with guns in Chicago during the time this investigation was going on, using up resources that otherwise could have been [brought] to bear on that front.""

Domenech added that Smollett may not be ""out of the woods"" just yet, pointing to the federal investigation into the threatening letter he reportedly sent to himself.

Walter insisted that no one ""should be surprised"" that wealthy and well-connected people ""get away with things"" that poor and non-well-connected people do not.

"Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg joked about brokering a ""peace deal"" between Chick-fil-A and the LGBT community during an interview on Tuesday.

The openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana declared his appreciation for the fast food chain even though they have been accused of supporting causes that discriminate against the LGBT community.

""I do not approve of their politics, but I kind of approve of their chicken,"" Buttigieg said during an appearance on ""The Breakfast Club.""

""Maybe if nothing else, I can build that bridge. Maybe I'll become in a position to broker that peace deal.""

The 37-year-old mayor, who has formed an exploratory committee to run for the Democratic nomination, also stressed the importance of finding common ground with those who may be different.

""We've got to find a way to use our identities to reach other people,"" Buttigieg said.

""What can we talk about that brings us together? Because I have no clue what it's like to walk in the shoes of so many other people. But I can talk about some of the pieces of what I carry with me, and see if it rhymes with their life experience.""

Buttigieg mentioned a number of experiences that could allow people to better understand each other.

""Good art has that, good music has that, good literature has that,"" he said about bridging the gap.

"If you don't follow First Amendment case law, the headline of this post reads like an ultimate ""man bites dog"" scenario. What? I thought we could predict case outcomes based on presidential appointments? That's far less true than you might think, and close observers will note that the judicial left frequently restrains the worst impulses of the social justice left. For example, progressive California state court judges are currently drawing a legal line in the sand in favor of due process rights in colleges and universities and against campus kangaroo sexual assault courts.

Though it was lost in the national news cycle, Central District of California Judge Jesus Bernal -- an Obama appointee -- issued a ruling that directly challenged government boycotts and reprisals against allegedly intolerant business owners. The case is called Riley's American Heritage Farms v. Claremont Unified School District, and the facts are similar enough to government actions against Chick-fil-A that the franchise's lawyers should take notice. The farm is a ""living history farm,"" and it frequently hosts school field trips. At the farm ""immersive presentations focused on the American Revolution, Civil War, American colonial farm life, California Gold Rush, and pioneering homesteading history."" The presentations strive to be historically accurate and contain no political or cultural commentary. The farm maintains a social media presence, and its social media accounts are also politics-free.

One of the farm's owners, James Riley, has his own Facebook account and is outspoken about politics and culture. For example, he once posted, """"I have just realized we may have been the last generation born with only two genders."" He also compared Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to an ice sculpture and ""juxtaposed Black Lives Matter members and ISIS.""

After private citizens complained about the posts, a number of principals prohibited teachers from sending their classes to the farm. When the farm complained to the school district, the district wrote a letter admitting that it was took action because of the owner's speech:

The District's letter referenced Riley's social media commentary and asserted that ""[n]othing in the First Amendment obligates the District to continue doing business with any individual or organization that makes public statements which are inimical to the District's educational mission . . . The District has . . . no obligation to expose children to an individual who engaged in these crude and tasteless comments."" The letter further insinuates the action was necessary to ""secure and protect"" students from""discrimination and harassment"" and to avoid ""expos[ing] them to inappropriate sexist or racist attitudes"" or ""sexually explicit, indecent or lewd speech.""

There was no claim, however, that Riley had engaged in any offensive speech in the presence of students.

The farm sued, and the district filed a motion to dismiss the case, claiming that the farm didn't have a constitutionally-protected interest in its business relationship with the district and that it had a pedogogical interest in ""disassociating itself from offensive speech and in maintaining its education system."" Judge Bernal's opinion is a short master class in unconstitutional retaliation, and his key conclusion is spot-on:

Defendants cancelled scheduled field trips to the Farm and created a policy prohibiting future field trips. Terminating this benefit is a matter of discretion reserved to the District and its agents; however, Defendants' cannot terminate the benefit for unconstitutional, retaliatory reasons. Because Plaintiffs plausibly allege the cancelled field trips and prohibition of field trips were in retaliation for Riley's online political commentary, Plaintiffs state a claim for First Amendment retaliation.

Judge Bernal's response to the district's pedagogical argument was direct and unambiguous: ""[A]lthough planning field trips may be a pedagogical matter entrusted to the District's discretion, the private views of a field trip venue owner do not motivate legitimate pedagogical concerns as a matter of law.""

The lesson here is clear. While private citizens may boycott businesses because they don't like the owner's politics, the government faces profound limits on its ability to punish offensive speech -- especially when that punishment means taking aim at a business for the purely private actions of its owner. The comparison to the government campaigns against Chick-fil-A is clear. Government bodies like San Antonio's city council are punishing Chick-fil-A not because of anything that happens in its restaurants but rather because they oppose the Chick-fil-A Foundation's private, constitutionally-protected contributions.

Before I close, let me note that I'm not entirely unbiased in my assessment of Judge Bernal. He's defended the First Amendment before -- in one of my cases. In 2013, he rejected UCLA's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit I brought on behalf Dr. James Enstrom, a researcher the university fired after he blew the whistle on government misconduct and academic fraud. After Judge Bernal's ruling, we were able to settle the case on very favorable terms. UCLA paid Enstrom compensation and effectively rescinded his termination. In fact, Enstrom's case was my last case before I joined NR full time the next month.

Judge Bernal was right on the law then, and he is right on the law now.

"Franklin D. Roosevelt making a national address at the White House in 1936. (Library of Congress)

The last time anyone sought to ""pack"" the Supreme Court, that hallowed independent branch of government was in the hands of conservatives imbued with the imperative of maintaining a strict construction of the Constitution.

That rankled Franklin Roosevelt, who got his big and innovative agenda through Congress with ease, only to have major elements of it nullified as unconstitutional. By 1937, the court had struck down nine out of the 11 major New Deal initiatives, leaving intact only the Tennessee Valley Authority and the devaluation of the dollar.

The ensuing battle, in which Roosevelt sought to remake the court to render it more hospitable to his thinking, consumed American politics for 168 days. Ultimately the president lost. He had overstepped and the political system slapped him down.

That episode from long ago may be instructive in our time. Leading liberal Democrats are once again contemplating initiatives to remake the Court, not through the normal course of nominations and confirmations but through a maneuver to alter suddenly the political balance of power in the country.

Back in 1937, FDR feared for the fate of major foundations of his bold agenda, including Social Security, the Wagner collective bargaining law, and the Utilities Holding Company Act. All were working their way up for judicial tests, and Roosevelt knew the court could very well strike them down too. He decided he had to do something about it. He had to remake the court.

And why not? In the wake of the 1936 elections, he stood at the pinnacle of his power. He had won reelection with nearly 61 percent of the popular canvas and an Electoral College tally of 523 to eight. The opposition Republicans held only 17 seats in the Senate and 89 in the House (to 333 for the Democrats). As journalists Joseph Alsop and Turner Catledge wrote in The 168 Days, their book on the subsequent political battle, ""Who was there to say him nay?""

Politically emboldened, FDR came up with a simple solution. He would foster legislation that allowed him to appoint a new justice, up to a total of 15, for every sitting justice who refused to retire at full pay within six months of reaching age 70. This was enough power to remake the court, given the justices' ages. Six of the nine justices were 70 or older.

When Roosevelt unveiled his plan on February 5, 1937, first to aghast members of Congress and then to reporters, he invited a political struggle far beyond anything he had anticipated. What followed were months of political maneuvering, intrigue, backroom bargaining, and furious oratory as the president pressed his plan with all the force and cunning he could muster. Meanwhile, his opponents, including many Democrats and New Dealers, moved to check his power grab.

When FDR's chief defender, Senate majority leader Joe Robinson, died in his bed of a heart attack, the president's court packing scheme died with him.

Capturing the drama, Alsop and Catledge shaped the story into a kind of Greek drama, with the president cast as the hero of the realm brought down by his own arrogance. ""Suddenly,"" they wrote, "" the old Greek Theme of Hubris and Ara, of Pride and the fall that comes after, dominated the play.""

And yet soon afterward it all seemed an unnecessary spectacle, because enough of the justices departed the bench the routine way to allow Roosevelt to recast the court. And then began a new era in American judicial history, one of court liberalism when judicial activism reigned in a host of areas. Roosevelt's New Deal emerged as a powerful altering force in American politics.

This era reached its flowering during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren, who headed the court from 1953 to 1969. The Warren Court demonstrated its activist sensibility chiefly in the areas of civil rights, civil liberties, judicial power, and federal power. Conservative writer Brent Bozell captured the era in the title of his 1967 book, The Warren Revolution.

This era came to an end with court nominations put forth by subsequent Republican presidents, notably Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But Nixon had two conservative court nominees from the South rejected before settling on the centrist Harry Blackmun. And some Republican court appointees turned out to be less conservative than anticipated. The result was that the court entered an era of relative political balance, with ""swing vote"" power wielded by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy. During this time, major decisions were handed down by both liberals and conservatives.

Now it seems the court is heading into a new conservative era, with a slim right-leaning majority of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. But Roberts seems more interested in maintaining the court's standing in the eyes of the American people than in any political ideology, and he could emerge as its next swing vote.

In any event, this brief history, starting with the conservative court that so rankled Franklin Roosevelt, demonstrates that the American republic has survived these swings in the court's general political outlook. Roosevelt ultimately got the court he wanted even after his blatant power grab was thwarted. The Warren court's lurch to the left ultimately was leavened by a more centrist judicial sensibility. And now a conservative court might be just what's needed to check the burgeoning power of the executive branch and the unelected managerial mandarins of the government and to thwart the judicial activism of the lower federal courts.

Many liberals, including some of the announced or putative Democratic candidates for president, have been flirting with the idea of a new court packing scheme of their own. They want to expand the court to 15 members and give the next (presumably Democratic) president a chance to remake it outside the normal course of presidential nominations.

Good luck with that. The American people don't like that kind of raw power maneuver, as FDR discovered to his chagrin. Any presidential candidate who pushes too hard on this issue will live to regret it, as will any president who seeks to succeed where Franklin Roosevelt, at the height of his influence, so abjectly failed.",45,The American Conservative,168 Days: Recalling an Old-Fashioned Court Packing Drama
"Mixing It Up: A South-Watcher's Miscellany, John Shelton Reed, Louisiana State University Press, 288 pages

Give you one reason you should read another book on the South, you say? Howabout: John Shelton Reed. The sociologist, long-time University of North Carolina professor, and barbecue connoisseur (I could say ""North Carolina barbecue,"" but that would beredundant) has been one of the most original and entertaining voices on all things Southern for nearly 50 years. His 1972 The Enduring South, in which he argued that the South is different from the rest of the United States but that what makes it different is always changing, put him on the map. Since then there have been touchstone sociological studies (One South (1982) and Southerners (1983)), a humorous typography of white Southerners (Southern Folk, Plain and Fancy (1986)), several collections of essays (Whistling Dixie (1992) and Minding the South (2003), among others), and, of course, the one and only Holy Smoke: The Big Book of North Carolina Barbecue (2008), which he wrote with his wife, Dale Volberg Reed.

His latest is Mixing It Up: A South-Watcher's Miscellany, which collects a selection of hiswork over the past 20 years. Reed is not sure, he tells us in the preface, that the pieces""hang together enough to make a book."" They are varied. We have essays on what it means to be Southern, lectures and op-eds on Southern politics, reviews, short pieces on food, brief analyses of the 1991 Southern Focus Poll, and even an interview. But Reed shouldn't worry. They hang together just fine -- all of them deal with the South in one way or another, and what better way to reflect a motley people than a motley collection of writing?

If the South is still different from the rest of the United States -- and Reed thinks it is -- what makes it the South today? It's not an agrarian way of life -- something that was already becoming a thing of the past when Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom, Donald Davidson, et al. extolled its virtues in 1930. Nor is it the ""burden of Southern history."" ""Southerners,"" Reed writes, ""are quite likely to agree that the Civil War doesn't mean much to them personally."" Civil War monuments continue to be removed from public spaces (or pulled down by mobs, like UNC's Silent Sam) and support for displaying the Confederate flag on state property has waned. Rural poverty (Northern poverty is almost entirely urban) and terrible test scores are two things that many people still associate with the South, but even those are increasingly things of the past (Mississippi aside). ""Someone described the economic South a few years ago,"" Reed writes, ""as something like 'patches of green in a vast brown swamp.' These days it would be more accurate to say that there are patches of brown in a flourishing green forest.""

Then, of course, there are the regional differences across the South that can make it sound absurd to talk about it in the singular. Barbecue is not the same in Memphis and Goldsboro, nor are accents in Savannah and Boone, nor the flavor of local politics in southern Louisiana and middle Tennessee.

And yet, Southerners still have more things in common with each other than they do with non-Southerners. ""Southerners,"" Reed writes, ""really do tend to be more religious, more conservative, more polite, more 'touchy.' They're more likely to hunt and fish, stop their cars for funerals, and eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day."" The economic progress of the South (a miracle if one considers where the South was a hundred years ago) has led Southerners to invent ""new and unpredictable ways to be different."" Consider two stereotypical Southern obsessions: country music and NASCAR. ""We need to remind ourselves,"" Reed writes, ""that both of those were twentieth-century innovations, made possible by technologies that didn't exist before. So, for that matter, were key lime pie and ice tea, which required sweetened condensed milk and reliable supplies of ice, respectively."" ""I would bet the farm, if I had a farm, on two propositions,"" Reed continues. ""One is that people will still be talking about the South a hundred years from now. And the other is that the South they'll be talking about will be a very different place...from the South we're in right now.""

Though this may be changing, black and white Southerners also still share more in common than their counterparts to the North. One thing they share more than others is food, and by food, of course, I mean barbecue. When we lived in Texas, some black neighbors once invited us over for a birthday party. We talked more over and about brisket than we had about anything else in the preceding six months. ""I don't think,"" Reed writes, ""you can really understand the South if you don't understand barbecue -- as food, process, and event."" Barbecue, like the South, is both regionally distinct and pan-Southern. The best places are in small towns or out-of-the-way holes in the wall in ""unsavory neighborhoods."" Recipes differ from cook to cook and the quality of the batch from day to day. But if you ""want to talk about heritage, not hate,"" Reed writes, talk barbecue. ""I once suggested half-seriously that if the South needs a new flag -- as it surely does -- we could do worse than to use a dancing pig with a knife and fork.""

One thing that hasn't changed is how Southerners do death. In a review of a book on Southern funerals, Reed remarks that ""a genteel Southern funeral is not the time or place for innovation."" ""Whether you're talking about flower arrangements, hymns, liturgy, or funeral food, there's a right way and a wrong way to do things, and the right way is usually pretty much the way it has always been done."" This includes making homemade mayonnaise to accompany the ""tomato aspic God meant for it to go with,"" though some traditions differ across denominations. Episcopalians ""tend to drink after funerals...and often before, as well."" They will happily eat a ""green-bean casserole with Campbell's soup and onion rings,"" but they would never bring one to a funeral. Methodists, on the other hand, ""believe that to get into heaven you have to bring a covered dish.""

On the topic of heritage -- and symbols like the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments -- Reed is an eminently practical man. ""The beginning of wisdom when it comes to the Confederate flag,"" he writes, ""is to recognize that it means different things to different people"" -- ""heritage"" to some, oppression to others. But he also suspects, and I think he's right, that ""many Southerners of both races are profoundly bored with the subject."" While he doesn't address the issue of Confederate monuments, he does make the case that late defenders of slavery or segregation should not simply be erased from the past. ""It's not that these views 'deserve a hearing,'"" he writes in a review of The Oxford Book of the American South, ""it is rather that the dominant voices of the South, not the dissenting ones, are now the most alien, the hardest for most modern readers to understand, and thus, in some ways, the most challenging."" It may be a clich√© that those who cannot remember the past ""are condemned to repeat it,"" as George Santayana put it, but it's no less true for being one.

Most of the essays have been published previously, and readers may wish to skim the section on Southern polling data, though Reed does draw some interesting conclusions from them. But if you've enjoyed Reed's charm and humor over the years, you'll want to pick up a copy of this book. I read most of it on my front porch waving to the occasional neighbor, which is the perfect way to read Reed. I would suggest reading him at your local barbecue joint, but not even John Shelton Reed can compete with pulled pork.",46,The American Conservative,The South Really is Weird
"Tuesday's 57-0 Senate vote against the Green New Deal, with 43 Democrats voting ""present,"" shows how Republicans can win on this nutty issue. But their attacks haven't quite yet hit the bull's-eye.

At the heart of the GND is a plan to outlaw hydrocarbon energy and produce all electricity from wind, solar and other ¬≠renewables. This isn't just wildly impractical. It would deliver a crippling blow to the economy. Coal, oil and gas left in the ground are jobs and income buried forever, causing a permanent contraction in the productive capacity of the economy. The GND would thus be a declaration of war on blue-collar America, imperiling the Trump recovery and its half a million new manufacturing jobs.

Republicans have decried the GND as ""socialist."" But whatever its real-world outcomes, and they were horrendous, at least the old socialism in theory sought to advance the economic interests of the working class. The GND does the opposite.

Subsidizing wind and solar while rooting out carbon is very expensive. That's why industrial electricity prices in Europe are nearly 50 percent higher than they are in the rest of the Group of 20 advanced nations -- and why energy firms are loath to invest in Europe.

Transplanting such European-style policies across the Atlantic, as the GND essentially aims to do, would kill energy jobs and drive up the price of energy in America. For American workers, the unspoken message from GND environmentalists is: Go and learn computer programming, or at best you will end up wiping snow and sand off solar panels.

The GND, in other words, is ¬≠redistributionist, yes, but the redistribution goes from the bottom to the top -- from the poor and from workers to wind and solar investors. Again, Europe's example is ¬≠instructive. The drive to subsidize renewable energy led Britain to drop its pledge to abolish fuel poverty. The official measure of fuel poverty, defined as households spending 10 percent or more of their income on energy, kept rising. So it was ¬≠replaced with a new government definition less sensitive to rising ¬≠energy costs, instantly halving the number of households officially deemed fuel poor.

Meanwhile in Germany, Europe's wealthiest country, at one stage more than 300,000 households a year were being disconnected ¬≠because of ¬≠unpaid bills.

""It is only gradually becoming apparent how the ¬≠renewable energy subsidies redistribute money from the poor to the more affluent,"" the left-of-center Der Spiegel newspaper editorialized. Energy companies know that the best way to avoid accusations of price gouging is to claim that it's to fight climate change. For this reason, ¬≠renewable energy acts as a conspiracy against the less well-off.

In the US, a capitalist aristocracy is pushing wind and solar. Its members include blue-blooded capital from the likes of the Rockefeller, MacArthur and Ford foundations, and Silicon Valley billionaires touting phony claims of 100 percent ¬≠renewable energy. Climate change is ethics for the super-rich. The self-righteous rhetoric of this aristocracy legitimizes the vast accumulations of wealth by the green robber barons of the 21st century.

The big question Republicans should ask is: Why?

Successful prosecutors show the motive behind the crime. So it is in politics. The supposed motive ¬≠behind the GND -- fighting climate change -- doesn't wash. If the scheme were genuinely about climate change, green activists would be campaigning to expand nuclear power rather than trying to shut it down. The truth is the climate war isn't about climate. It is and always has been deeply ideological.

Control energy to reverse the ¬≠Industrial Revolution and abolish industrial capitalism -- these are the real targets of green ideology.

The progressives' climate war is a war that will be lost before the first shot is fired. America doesn't exist in a climate bubble. China, India and other developing economies are going to keep growing and keep emitting. The good news is that the GND could well fracture the Democratic coalition, pitting billionaire funders and upper-middle-class green ¬≠activists against blue-collar workers and ethnic minorities for whom well-paying jobs and cost of living come first.

Both for reasons of principle and political advantage, Republicans are right to put GND front and center. But the message they need to ¬≠develop shouldn't just focus on the plan's impracticality. Instead, the right should hammer at the left's class war against workers. Hone and repeat that message through 2020, and they will win.",47,New York Post,Behind the Green New Deal: an elite war on the working class
"Of all the reputations in tatters now that Robert Mueller has exploded the Russian-collusion fantasy, Obama-era spy chiefs John Brennan and James Clapper stand out.

For the past two years, the men prominently insisted not only that President Trump had teamed up with Russian President Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election but that Trump was Putin's pawn.

""I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was"": That was Brennan's pathetic response to Mueller's findings -- after years when he regularly traded on his status as former CIA director to defame Trump.

""When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,"" he tweeted at the president. Russia ""may have something"" on Trump, he told the world. Now he thinks he suspected he didn't know as much as he'd thought?

Former Director of National Intelligence Clapper has yet to express even that much regret for his pointed comments, such as that ex-KGB officer Putin ""knows how to handle an asset.""

These two weren't average citizens: They spoke with the authority of having headed federal intel operations. Brennan even cited his training as an ""intelligence professional"" as the basis for his views.

By milking that status for brutal hits on Trump, they not only misled and divided the country, they damaged the credibility of the US intel community.

Of course, they were crossing the line while in office, running interference for President Barack Obama's disastrous Iran deal and other policies.

But America's top spooks are supposed to steer clear of politics completely once they leave office. By ignoring that rule (as well as basic honesty) for purely partisan ends, Clapper and Brennan violated their duty -- despicably.",48,New York Post,Mueller's conclusions expose disgrace of Obama's spy chiefs
"Forty-three Democrats voted ""present"" and three Democrats -- Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Doug Jones (D-AL) -- voted against the resolution. Independent Angus King (I-ME) also voted with Republicans against the measure.

Many Democrats -- including Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who sponsored the resolution in the Senate -- called the vote a ""sham"" because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called for it without scheduling any hearings.

""[Climate change] is the national security, economic, health care and moral issue of our time,"" Markey said at a press conference at the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""We must act now.""

""Republicans and President Trump may choose to be in denial about the consequences of climate change,"" Markey said. ""But to ordinary people, climate change is not politics. It is life and death.""

""It is not a resolution,"" Markeysaid. ""It is a revolution.""

But even if Democrats voted ""present,"" McConnell said Tuesday's vote put them on the record in favor of the radical resolution, which calls for the transformation of the American economy and infrastructure, including ending air travel and retrofitting every building in America.

""I ask again if you believe the Green New Deal is the prescription for America, why would you not want to have a vote?"" McConnell told reporters ahead of the vote.

"Rep. Ilhan Omar criticizes Israel at Council on American-Islamic Relations fundraiser

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back Tuesday at Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) weeks after her remarks deemed anti-Semitic triggered controversy.

""Take it from this Benjamin: It's not about the Benjamins!"" Netanyahu said to the Washington conference via satellite in response to a tweet Omar posted in February.

Omar drew condemnation from members of both parties last month after she suggested in the tweet that AIPAC has been paying members of Congress to support Israel. She later apologized for the tweet -- and for other comments -- but also insisted on what she called ""the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.""

Weeks before elections in Israel, Netanyahu's poll numbers have sagged since the announcement of a pending indictment on corruption charges.

""It's because America and Israel share a love of freedom and democracy. It's because we cherish individual rights and the rule of law,"" Netanyahu told AIPAC, as USA Today reported.

Netanyahu cut short a visit to the U.S. and rushed back to Israel on Tuesday to deal with the military response to Palestinian militants firing rockets at Israel this week.

Netanyahu on Monday visited the White House, where President Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel occupied in 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1981.

This, even though ""from the earliest days of this administration, Donald Trump never executed the kind of rapprochement with Russia he advertised on the campaign trail."" Instead, the 45th president sanctioned Kremlin figures, sold weapons to anti-Moscow allies like Poland and Ukraine and even struck Russian mercenaries in Syria. All this, plus the Mueller outcome, Rothman argues, ""should be cause for celebration.""

But ""now Santa Mueller has gone back to the North Pole, leaving just a written report,"" whose gist is that Trump hadn't, in fact, ""colluded or coordinated with Russia.""

Lately, tensions have been boiling over, while ""demonstrations against Hamas have been continuing throughout the Gaza Strip."" With Hamas' popularity on the decline, the group likely launched the missile in the hope that it ""bring a strong military ¬≠response from Israel"" and galvanize Palestinian opinion in its favor.

"Ezra Pound, who might have recognized a thing or two in our current political environment and found them familiar, once defined literature as ""news that stays news."" Two of William Shakespeare's plays have for the past ten years or so been of particular interest for the light they shed on American political news. The first is Macbeth, which is in the end a play about debt, a subject from which there is no escape in this life. The other is Richard III.

Richard III is an interesting play and Richard III is an interesting character because of the way in which contradictory tendencies come together in them: the gravity of high affairs of state conducted with glib frivolity, crimes of the worst depravity perpetrated with lightness of spirit, civil war understood as a kind of schoolboy romance. Nobody, including Shakespeare, seems to be taking things quite as seriously as they should be taken.

Richard III is a play in which the principal characters lie to one another -- and to themselves -- about their motives. In the famous opening soliloquy (""Now is the winter of our discontent""), Richard, who is a hunchback, informs the audience that he is embarking on a course of treachery as a balm for his romantic exclusion: ""Since I cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well-spoken days, I am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days."" He convinces Elizabeth that he killed her husband, the Prince of Wales, and her father-in-law, King Henry VI, out of desire for her. She eventually marries him, purportedly out of pity -- continuing the theme of self-deception -- and he murders her children. Elizabeth asks the elderly Queen Margaret for advice on how to curse Richard, and Margaret offers a master's course in self-deception:

Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;

Compare dead happiness with living woe;

Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,

And he that slew them fouler than he is:

Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.

Fouler than he is. That is the current operating mode of American presidential politics, which in these imperial times comprehends American politics as a whole.

There was a great deal to dislike about Barack Obama, and much to oppose. He was preening and dishonest, a serial violator of constitutional constraints, an aggrandizer of presidential power with contempt for the legislative branch and its prerogatives, and, not least, an assassin. But for many of his critics -- Donald J. Trump prominent among them -- that wasn't enough. He had to be something more and something worse, something fouler than he is: a secret Marxist agent, a Kenyan-born crypto-jihadist, a Manchurian candidate. None of that was exactly political in the conventional sense: Conservatives and Republicans were going to oppose the Obama administration because of its left-wing agenda and its contempt for the constitutional order. The Kenyan/Marxist/Muslim stuff was not about how Republicans thought about Obama -- it was about how they thought about themselves.

And now the same story repeats itself in the matter of President Trump and the Russia investigation. Trump's defects as a man have been uncontested public knowledge for decades now -- he has made them part of his brand. His deficiencies as a president are well known and admitted even by those of his partisans who have a measure of intellectual honesty. But that is not enough for his opponents -- not as a matter of politics but as a matter of theater, the dramatic narrative in which they understand themselves to be plucky heroes standing bravely against the incursions of an alien menace, soldiers in the resistance, anything other than ordinary political partisans whose personal bitterness and bile are grossly in excess of what the actual facts of the political case would justify.

It is of course more comforting for Democrats to believe that they were sucker-punched in 2016 by a conspiracy led by the Russian intelligence apparatus rather than bested in ordinary electoral politics by a man who, though a teetotaler, took as his unstated campaign slogan: ""Hold My Beer!""

Who would choose to be feckless chumps when they could instead be martyrs to democracy? Who could resist bettering the conditions of their loss by making the bad causer worse? Only those who are willing and able to make the supernatural effort to be honest with themselves.

Like Richard III, our political partisans tell themselves that they are acting not out of inchoate malice or thirst for power but out of love: love for the one half of the country that they do not hate, and hate utterly. But Richard loves no one -- least of all himself. As he waits sleepless on the night before a battle in which victory is far from assured, he faces the facts: ""I love myself. Wherefore? For any good that I myself have done unto myself?"" In the end, we all face the facts -- we are made to.

For the Democrats, this is a springtime of discontent: They had been hoping, with a smile inside, to hear a tale of treason authored under the imprimatur of the special counsel, and are bitterly disappointed to be denied it. What good have they done unto themselves?",54,nationalreview.com,Springtime of Their Discontent | National Review
"Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, highlighted the evidence of Russia-related political corruption connected to Bill and Hillary Clinton and John Podesta while reflecting on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian political interference involving President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

Schweizer joined Monday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight for an interview with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.

LISTEN:

Schweizer said, ""The very thing that they are accusing Donald Trump of having done, which Mueller has come back and said there's no evidence for -- not that there's a little evidence or a small amount of evidence; there's no evidence -- is the very sort of behavior that you could look at the Clinton relationships in Russia -- the commercial ties, the financial ties, the favors done -- and raise those very same questions.""

Schweizer added, ""In the case of the Clintons and the Clinton world, they have long, deep, abiding ties with Putin's Russia. On the Uranium One deal, this is basically a company that was formed back in 2005 when Bill Clinton helped a Canadian named Frank Giustra obtain uranium rights in Kazakhstan in 2005.""

Schweizer continued, ""There's been really no investigation of the Clinton world, where you have all of these financial transactions and political favors being done. It's quite an astonishing contrast between the two.""

""Mainstream media news outlets,"" observed Schweizer, refuse to inquire about relationships between the Russian government and the Podesta and Clinton families.

Schweizer explained how the Clinton Foundation received money from Russian sources who directly benefited from a State Department initiative led by Hillary Clinton to enhance Russia's technological capacities -- including military applications -- via its Skolkovo Innovation Center.

""Another [event] that goes to the heart of this issue with Russia ... is an initiative that Hillary Clinton had while she was secretary of state called Skolkovo,"" stated Schweizer. ""Skolkovo was an initiative by the Hillary Clinton State Department to help the Russians during the Russian Reset -- so this is 2009 through basically 2011 and 2012 -- develop their own Silicon Valley.""

Schweizer went on, ""Now, what could go wrong with an idea like that? Essentially what they did was, they lined up Western tech companies to help the Russian government develop its technological capabilities. Some of the members of Skolkovo became donors to the Clinton Foundation and the Russians took Skolkovo.""

Schweizer continued, ""This is of course all happening while her foundation is getting money from Russian-linked companies that wanted the Uranium One deal to go through -- that Skolkovo ends up enhancing the Russian military, and that was the conclusion of the U.S. Army and the military who did reports [saying] Skolkovo helped the Russian military develop its hypersonic cruise missile. That's their words, not mine.""

Schweizer concluded, ""Yet again, here you have another area in which team Clinton [is not investigated]. ""There's a transference of funds, some of the Skolkovo participants on the Russian side are giving money to the Clinton Foundation, and Hillary Clinton as secretary of state is carrying out initiatives that are beneficial to the Russian military, and nobody asks a question about it. Nobody challenges her about it. She is somehow the adult in the room that is going to handle Russian policy and is going to be so much better at it than anybody else.""

""It's always hard to know why political leaders make certain decisions,"" stated Schweizer. ""In the case of the Clintons, we know that they were getting paid and we know that they were taking favorable actions for these foreign entities. ... I don't know why the Justice Department under Donald Trump didn't seem to investigate these matters related to the Clintons.""

Combating foreign-funded political corruption must be prioritized by the Trump administration, advised Schweizer. ""This is vital to pursue, not so much because it's Hillary and Bill Clinton, but because it cuts to the heart of the problems we have in Washington, DC,"" he said. ""And that is the fact that the permanent political class -- this includes Republicans and Democrats -- are cashing in big time with foreign entities. We are long past the day when we should be worrying just about pharmaceutical companies or oil companies or labor unions manipulating our politicians.""

Schweizer explained how the Clintons innovated and set new precedents for the monetization of political influence.

""The game in town, now, is foreign money, because there's a lot more of it,"" remarked Schweizer. ""What the Clintons basically did was set up a system that said, 'We are going to get paid while we are in political office.' Think about this. The idea, 20 years ago, that you could be the secretary of state -- America's lead diplomat [and] strategist on foreign policy -- and your husband could be getting paychecks from foreign governments for speeches, and be paid speaking fees that are multiple times more than he was getting before you became secretary of state, and that you family foundation -- which had your name on it until you took it off the day before you became secretary of state -- could be taking in hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign governments at the same time you're America's chief diplomat is mind-boggling. And yet that's what the Clintons did.""

Schweizer lamented what he described as partisan and political favoritism afforded to Democrats by the federal government's investigative bodies.

""[With] Hillary Clinton, you didn't have some anonymously-sourced dossier that nobody would independently verify that launched a thousand ships to investigate the president,"" Schweizer compared. ""You had a secretary of state and her husband who were taking donations from individuals and foreign governments, they were hiding those donations, they signed an agreement with President Obama saying they were going to disclose all of them, they were actively hiding them from public scrutiny, and they were making decisions that benefited the people that were paying them money. That's legions more evidence than you had in the Trump case, and yet one gets investigated and on does not.""

""There needs to be a standard in looking looking at a problem or issue,"" declared Schweizer. ""So if you're concerned about Russian meddling in American politics and that there's some kind of collusion or favoritism going on, why are you only interested in one person doing it? Why do you not say, 'We're concerned about Russian influence at the highest levels of American politics'?""

Schweizer closed, ""My larger point is, why are you only interested in contacts, possible collaboration or collusion, or transactions involving one political figure and administration, and not another? If the problem is a problem, it should be an equal problem whether the person has a D or R after their name.""",55,Breitbart,"Schweizer: Legions More Evidence on Clinton, but Mueller Chases Trump"
"Court avoids ruling on gerrymandering constitutionality in two cases, one from Wisconsin Democrats, the other from Maryland Republicans that challenged redrawn congressional and legislative districts; Doug McKelway reports.

The Supreme Court appeared convinced Tuesday that congressional maps drawn by two state legislatures were overly partisan, but worried whether judges themselves should be the ones to remedy the long-simmering issue.

Partisan gerrymandering may be the wonky side of politics, but the stakes are huge: the balance of power in state legislatures and Congress could tip in coming years, particularly after the 2020 census, when voting boundaries will be redrawn based on population changes.

The justices heard two separate cases. In North Carolina, the 2011 map drawn by the GOP-led legislature now has 10 of 13 congressional seats held by Republicans, despite an overall state population that is mostly divided along party lines, and where statewide elections have recently been close.

And in Maryland, the issue was whether Republican voters could go to court and challenge a redistricting plan they say violated their First Amendment rights. That 2011 voting map shifted the political balance in the state's rural 6th congressional district, turning a traditional GOP stronghold to Democratic control in an overall blue state.

GOP VOTERS WIN GERRYMANDERING LAWSUIT FORCING MARYLAND TO DRAW NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP FOR 2020

""Under any measure, this is excessive, isn't it?"" said Justice Elena Kagan.

""The stated goal was seven/one,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh told the lawyer representing Maryland, saying Democrats openly boasted of their efforts to have only one Republican member of Congress. ""I mean, I don't think you should run away from the obvious.""

A new round of nationwide redistricting will occur after next year's census. Republicans used strong state victories in 2010 to significantly shape electoral maps to their advantage.

The nearly 80-minues of arguments inside the courtroom showed again the justices would be hard-pressed to articulate a clear, definitive ruling on limiting partisanship in the map-drawing process.

The justices have never invalidated a voting district because of an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. And the targeted questioning from the bench suggested they would not use the pending cases as the precedent to decide the landmark issue.

""The Supreme Court will soon hear arguments over whether politicians can be trusted to draw up their own districts,"" wrote the governors of Maryland and North Carolina in a joint Washington Post op-ed on Monday. ""Take it from us. They can't.""

SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH TEXAS ON GERRYMANDERING DISPUTE

In arguments, lawyer Paul Clement, representing North Carolina lawmakers, pointedly told the court to be wary about wading too deeply into the discretion of lawmakers. ""Once you get into the political thicket, you will not get out and you will tarnish the image of this Court.""

Justice Stephen Breyer said that was why the court needed to find a ""clear standard"" going forward. Without it, ""you will turn many, many elections in the United States over to the judges,"" he said. ""There's always someone who wants to contest it. They will always find experts of all kinds. And what you'll discover is judges simply deciding too much.""

""Have we really reached the moment, even though it would be a big lift for this Court to get involved, where the other actors can't do it?"" asked Kavanaugh.""

Justice Neil Gorsuch was more pointed: ""Why should we wade into this?""

But Justice Sonia Sotomayor and others on the bench pushed back.

""It can't be that simply because the Constitution says that a particular act is in the hands of one branch of government,"" she said, ""that deprives the courts of reviewing whether that action is constitutional or not.""

""This is what this is about,"" she added of the North Carolina map. ""You're discriminating on the basis of a group's speech and diluting their vote accordingly.""

MYSTERY COMPANY MUST COMPLY WITH SUBPOENA LINKED TO MUELLER PROBE, APPELLATE COURT RULES

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted previous high court precedent gives it jurisdiction over the issue, including the mandate of giving equal individual weight in legislative apportionment, the so-called ""one person, one vote"" standard.

""Does one person have one vote that counts equally with others if the impact of her vote is reduced based on her party affiliation?"" she asked.

Courts nationwide in recent months have tossed out GOP plans in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Opponents of the plans say their constitutional rights were violated.

Attorney Emmet Bondurant -- who in 1962 successfully argued one of the first partisan gerrymandering case at the high court -- called out GOP lawmakers in North Carolina.

""They take the position that no matter how predominant the intent, no matter how extreme the effects,"" he told the justices, ""there are absolutely no constitutional limitations on partisan gerrymander.""

Several conservative justices repeatedly questioned the alternative formulas offered by Bondurant and the attorney opposing Maryland's map.

""I think is going to turn on numbers, right? How much deviation from proportional representation is enough to dictate an outcome?"" asked an exasperated Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""So aren't we just back in the business of deciding what degree of tolerance we're willing to put up with from proportional representation? We might pluck a number out of the air or see that, you know, maybe two-thirds is used for veto overrides, so we like that. Where are we going to get the number on the business end of this?""

More than three-dozen states rely on the state legislature to directly redraw boundaries, now using sophisticated computer models that have the ability target voters by their street or household. Other states such as California rely on an independent commission to create what supporters say would be less extreme districts.

The justices appeared aware of the consequences, with Kavanaugh saying ""extreme partisan gerrymandering is a real problem for our democracy -- and I'm not going to dispute that.""

But Chief Justice John Roberts stated the obvious in politics -- if one party is enjoying the benefits of a redistricting map, it will be loath to change it.

""I suppose the members of Congress are pretty happy with the way the districting has been done,"" he said, bringing uneasy laughter in the crowded courtroom.

The Maryland case is Lamone v. Benisek (18-726). Rulings are expected by June.",56,Fox News,Supreme Court warily weighs partisan gerrymandering
"You know the constant griping I hear from a certain kind of Christian conservative, concerning the Benedict Option: that it's a call to retreat from the front lines of the culture war. They're not exactly wrong. It is a call to disengage from the primary front, and to take up new forms of resistance, because under present conditions, we cannot hope to win in a conventional way.

I was thinking about this the other day when considering the case of Vaclav and Kamila Benda. Vaclav was a Czech anticommunist dissident who really was on the front lines -- and who went to prison for his political labors. Kamila, his wife, was equally a dissident, but she did not put herself on the line in precisely the same way her husband did. Her resistance was quieter; it was one of nurturing the movement. She told me last year that when her husband had been suffering in prison for years, the government offered him amnesty in exchange for leaving Czechoslovakia with his family. He was tempted to take it, in part because he hated that his wife was having to raise their large family on her own in his absence. Kamila wrote to him to say no, stay there; we're fine on the home front. If we take the easy way out, she said, what will that say about our cause? What kind of message will that send to the dissidents who don't have the same opportunity?

So Vaclav Benda (d. 1999) stayed in prison, and Kamila Bendova remained at home, raising their children, doing her part for the resistance.

Vaclav Benda was a more conventional hero. We find it harder to appreciate the heroism of a Kamila Bendova -- but that is exactly the kind of heroism we need as much if not more than the former.

I say this because a reader asked me to reply to this talk by an Estonian Catholic lawyer who calls for Catholic men to recover their militancy. He writes, in part:

In many ways, the battles we face today are more complicated than the military conflicts of the past. Every man knows what he is called to do when a hostile army invades his country. But what do when it is difficult even to understand the nature of the battles - inside the Church, and outside in the realm of philosophy, morals, culture, law, politics and the economy - let alone our role in them? It requires prayer, contemplation and doctrinal formation to understand the sly and insidious Revolution that does not show itself openly yet seeks to corrupt everything true, beautiful and good.

Our battles are predominantly spiritual. As Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, ""the battle line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man."" This is where our most important battle is fought because it profits us nothing to win the whole world but lose our soul. We must bear in mind that when we fight the forces of evil we cannot succeed if we rely on our own strength. Our only hope is that God works in and through us. However, we must prepare ourselves properly to make this possible. If sin lives in us, we cannot fight sin outside us. This is why the sacraments, prayer and proper spiritual direction are so important.

There is a lot we can learn from the words of the Greek statesman, Demosthenes. When difficulties caused his fellow citizens to lose hope he told them: ""Athenians! Certainly, things are going badly and you are in despair. But in this you are wrong! If, after having done all that was necessary to ensure that things should go well, you had still seen them turn out badly, you might have reason to despair. Yet hitherto things have gone badly only because you have not done what was necessary so that they should do otherwise. It is still open to you to do what you have so far not done. Then things will go well. Why, then, should you despair so soon?"" Let us bear these words in mind and think about what we can do, firstly to understand the battle, secondly, to prepare ourselves for it, and finally, to engage in fighting for the values, principles and ideals that form our Catholic faith.

We are told by the modern world that the problem with society is excessive masculinity. Nothing could be further from the truth. The meaning of masculinity has been distorted and it is our task to restore it - first of all in ourselves and then in society at large. This restoration begins in the understanding that masculinity is about militancy in the broadest sense. Men, by their nature, are called to be defenders of truth, justice, goodness and other high ideals. To fight against the enemies of the Church in the spirit of love, dedication, perseverance and sacrifice is a vocation we are called to for the greater glory of God, for the salvation of souls and for the sanctification of our own soul. This fight must begin in our soul but it extends to every aspect of our spiritual and social life, with kindness and love, but without sentimentalism, false piety and softness. If we are to be the light of the world we must let the light of God shine, without fear or compromise, without counting the cost, trusting in God and relying on His grace. Fighting goes hand in hand with sacrifice and suffering and this provides us with a simple, but effective test: if we do not suffer, then we are not fighting any serious battles.

I agree with this, and I'm not sure at all that the writer, a man named Varro Vooglaid, would disagree with the Benedict Option. The battle we face really is more complicated than in the past! And that's why the heroes we need are fit for the battle we face now, not the one we faced 50 years ago. Tactics the French army learned for the conventional battlefield were only of limited use to the French Resistance.

I think of these white nationalist armchair soldiers who express concern with the unwinding of Western civilization, but who don't do anything about it except nurture violent grievance fantasies and, on occasion, act them out. Do they marry? Do they have children? Do they start or help build up schools where children are taught about Western civilization? Are they part of a church? And so forth. If not, why not? Is it because doing the dutiful things necessary to build and to hold something of worth seems too boring?

To switch the metaphor: for traditional Christians, this crisis is not the 100-meter dash; this is a marathon. We are going to have to find a way to revive the militant spirit of which Vooglaid speaks, but also to channel it in prudent ways appropriate to the nature of the war we fight.

What I'm hearing from my traditional Christian contacts around the country is frustration over the unwillingness of people who think of themselves as religious conservatives to do the hard work of building and sustaining a real resistance. One man told me not long ago that he and his wife took their kids out of their local Catholic school and put them into a classical Christian school because their kids weren't learning anything at the Catholic school. He said that he and his wife finally concluded that most parents didn't want the Catholic school to be challenging, not on faith matters or anything else.

I heard the same thing last year from a Catholic educator who told me that the Catholic school bureaucracy in his city was mediocre and fiercely devoted to protecting that mediocrity. And most parents, in his view, were happy with that, because they were only really interested in alleviating their anxiety over their children's education. That is, they wanted to be able to tell themselves that their children were getting a ""Catholic education,"" whatever that turned out to be. This, in a deep Red State diocese.

As an Evangelical educator told me once, ""A lot of people who send their kids to classical Christian schools are really only concerned with saving their kids from liberalism.""

In his talk, Vooglaid identified three battles as having been crucial for the survival of Christendom: Tours, Lepanto, and Vienna 1683. He's right about that, but notice that all three of those battles were literal battles, and were against an outside enemy (forces loyal to Islam). Today, the battle is within. Vooglaid says:

The militant spirit and the virtue of militancy cannot merely be intellectual they must also be practical - that is, about our own lives. It is wrong to fall into the error of activism, seeing action as the sole means of our fight, it is just as wrong to adopt pietism or intellectualism, refusing to engage in action and hoping that prayer or endless discussions will solve our problems.

He's completely right here as well. To this I would add, again, that militancy is not an either-or question. Yes, we have to fight for religious liberty, and for other things we hold to be true and good. But as Christians, none of it matters if we fail to pass on the living faith to our children.

Here's an example, though not about religion in particular. It has helped me think more clearly about my next book project (of which I expect to have good news to report soon). As I was struggling with the nature of the project, and whether or not to focus on recrudescent socialism, a friend put a couple of questions to me. Basically, she said:

If we kept electing Republicans from here until kingdom come, would that change the threat you see?

If we kept the economic status quo, would that change the threat you see?

The answer to both questions is: No.

That being the case, then the problem is not really socialism, is it?

In the same way, if traditional Christians can't identify specific, achievable goals that would enable them to say, ""We have won this war,"" then we had better reconsider how we fight it.

True, the battle is never truly winnable until the end of time. We know this. At this point in our time and place, ""winning"" is not even converting the world; it's simply holding our own. We should want to convert the world, but right here, right now, it is more important to convert ourselves and our children. Or, as the church historian Robert Louis Wilken put it back in 2004:

Nothing is more needful today than the survival of Christian culture, because in recent generations this culture has become dangerously thin. At this moment in the Church's history in this country (and in the West more generally) it is less urgent to convince the alternative culture in which we live of the truth of Christ than it is for the Church to tell itself its own story and to nurture its own life, the culture of the city of God, the Christian republic. This is not going to happen without a rebirth of moral and spiritual discipline and a resolute effort on the part of Christians to comprehend and to defend the remnants of Christian culture.

Fighting for the independence and liberty of Christian schools is extremely important. But if those schools don't use their liberty and independence to form intellectually, morally, and spiritually serious Christians -- as opposed to good middle-class American achievers with a veneer of Christianity -- it will all have been in vain.

Philip Rieff said:

The death of a culture begins when its normative institutions fail to communicate ideals in ways that remain inwardly compelling, first of all to the cultural elites themselves.

The greatest challenge facing believing Christians today is to communicate the faith and its teachings in way that remain inwardly compelling to ourselves and our children.

Not outwardly compelling, but inwardly. Vooglaid is right: we do need militancy, but rightly targeted. Francoist Spain was thoroughly, formally Catholic. And when Franco died, so did a large part of the Church there. Similarly with Ireland, where the Catholic Church was formally dominant, but which had ceased to be able to convey its ideals to its people in ways that were inwardly compelling. This is why Irish Catholicism collapsed so quickly.

So it will be with the rest of us. Choose your enemies wisely.",57,The American Conservative,Choose Your Enemies Wisely

Harris unveils $315 billion teacher raise package - Axios: ""2020 Democratic candidate Sen. Kamala Harris has unveiled a teacher pay plan that would give the average teacher a $13,500 raise, after saying at a Houston rally last weekend that she would make the largest-ever federal investment in educators' pay if elected president. Why it matters: Harris is the first 2020 candidate to release a plan like this. This proposal helps her expand her economic message to address one of the public crises we've seen play out over the last two years through teachers' strikes around the country. The plan would cost around $315 billion over a span of ten years, 'paid for by strengthening the estate tax and cracking down on loopholes' on tax breaks for wealthy people. The $13,500 pay raise is equivalent to a 23% base pay increase for the average teacher, according to the plan.""

MUELLER OUTCOME DOESN'T MAKE OR BREAK HOGAN 2020

WashEx: ""Gov. Larry Hogan was still mulling a 2020 bid after special counsel Robert Mueller cleared President Trump of colluding with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016, an aide to the Maryland Republican confirmed on Monday. Hogan has been encouraged to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination by opponents of the president inside the Republican Party. The governor has emphasized he would not wage a quixotic primary against Trump. But even though Trump appeared stronger politically post-Mueller, Hogan was still weighing several factors, and did not plan to make a definitive decision about running for president until as late as early fall. 'It's not moving the needle one way or the other,' the Hogan aide said of Mueller's findings, in an email exchange with the Washington Examiner. ... But Hogan appears patient, content to wait and see if other probes into Trump -- by House Democrats and possibly the Southern District of New York -- net more political trouble for the president.""

Weld will announce Trump primary challenge decision in April - Politico: ""Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld says he's leaning toward challenging President Donald Trump in the 2020 Republican primary, and expects to make a decision in April. Weld gave the clearest sense of his intentions yet, and laid out a path to the GOP nomination during an appearance on the New Hampshire radio talk show Pints & Politics on Monday afternoon. 'I'm leaning towards doing it unless something changes, and set myself an informal deadline of the month of April to pull the trigger,' Weld told reporters here during a stop. The former two-term governor said he'll focus on the early-voting state of New Hampshire... If he runs, Weld said he expects to be competitive across New England and in the mid-Atlantic states. He also expects his challenge could gain traction in California, which votes the first week in March.""

HOUSE VOTE ON BORDER EMERGENCY VETO LIKELY TO FAIL

Politico: ""The House on Tuesday will try -- and fail -- to overturn President Donald Trump's veto of a congressional resolution killing his national wall emergency, capping off a months-long congressional battle over the president's signature campaign issue. But even as some members of the GOP face a backlash for defying Trump, few if any House Republican defectors who supported the disapproval resolution are expected to flip their votes and side with the president in the override vote, according to lawmakers and aides. After the effort to block Trump's veto fails, the fight over his attempt to use executive action to build a border wall will shift to the courts, where its fate is far less certain. Still, Tuesday's override vote will hand the president yet another victory this week following the conclusion of special counsel Bob Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, adding a cherry on top of what is undoubtedly the GOP's best stretch since losing their House majority last fall.""

Pentagon authorizes up to $1 billion to start border wall construction - Fox News: ""The Pentagon notified Congress late Monday that it authorized the transfer of up to $1 billion to erect 57 miles of 'pedestrian fencing' along the U.S.-Mexico border in direct support of President Trump's national emergency declaration from last month. The fencing, which will be 18 feet high, is to be erected in the Yuma and El Paso sectors, the statement read. The Pentagon's announcement was notable. A reporter from the New York Times tweeted that it is the first time the funds will be transferred under section 284 for the border wall. Section 284 allows the Pentagon to 'construct roads and fences and to install lighting to block drug-smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States in support of counter-narcotic activities of Federal law enforcement agencies,' the statement read.""

""Chris, Can you recommend the name of a good general American history book? Nothing to deep, not a history major, just an old retired West Virginia boy looking to learn some more. Read your book, excellent."" - Michael Strader, Toccoa, Ga.

[Ed. note: That's a tough one, Mr. Strader. General histories of topics so large tend to be out of proportion. When you're covering 500 years in a few hundred pages, things get out of whack. May I suggest a few books that would provide some building blocks for further inquiry? ""1776"" by David McCullough, ""Founders' Son"" by Richard Brookhiser and ""American Colossus"" by H.W. Brands. That ought to get you up to the modern era in pretty good shape!]

""Chris, Your note yesterday that '[Alexander] Hamilton was permanently disgraced because of hush money he paid to cover up an affair' was certainly somewhat true, but a bigger reason that Mr. Hamilton was marginalized after President [George] Washington's second term was that he opposed John Adams in favor of Thomas Pinckney for president in 1796 and Charles Pinckney over Adams in the 1800 presidential election. Right or wrong, it is a significant political gamble to oppose the leader/President of your own party. Alexander Hamilton was unable to unite the Federalists with him as the head of the party. To succeed, it takes talent, timing, good judgement, wisdom and charisma, all of which Ronald Reagan had when he successfully united his party in opposition to the less conservative Ford Republicans."" - Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.

[Ed. note: Certainly a factor, Mr. Haldorson. Hamilton's impetuousness was hardly limited to marital matters! But I think the whole *ahem* affair was what finally rendered him as a political untouchable.]

""This 'uncalled for' statement of opinion on the part of Mueller, has no reason for being, other than to wedge a disparaging observation into a report which was trumpeted to be factual. Of course, nothing can exonerate Trump or anyone else. When one thinks about it, one realizes that it is not possible to prove that something never happened. In this clumsy stretch to restate this manifest axiom, Mueller exposes his hand and panders to the left."" - Brian Kellogg, Derby, N.Y.

[Ed. note: Holy smokes, Mr. Kellogg!

""From the 'Not Quite Never Trump' wing of the Republican Party, this weekend's events makes me feel a lot more positive about President Trump and I know I'm not alone. One thing I've really taken to heart in the last few years is that people feel personally attacked when you demean/insult their political standard-bearer, even if they don't personally support that person. As a lifelong Republican, I don't like Donald Trump. I don't like his pettiness, lack of self-control or these huge fiscal deficits. But the constant drumbeat of outrageous, over-the-top 'Russian collusion' attacks and the sudden demolition of that line of attack in the Mueller Report instinctively makes me want to rally around him. What I take from this is that I myself need to avoid vicious personal attacks on Bernie Sanders, [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez and the Ilhan Omars of the world. Plenty of my liberal friends might not support these people but if I start insulting those politicians, my liberal friends are more likely to rally round and support them. I know because I can feel it happening to me."" - Brian D. Liddicoat, Watsonville, Calif.

"Here's a superb Ross Douthat column on what the Mueller affair means for US politics. In it, he talks about the ""paranoid center,"" and draws an interesting parallel:

This pattern points to the essential difference between paranoias of the fringes and what Reason's Jesse Walker once called ""the paranoid center."" Because the center believes in the basic goodness of American and Western institutions, the basic wisdom and patriotism of their personnel, its threat matrix is always attuned to Great Enemies outside and radicals within, and its greatest fears tend to involve the two groups working together -- whether that means Middle Eastern dictators and Islamist sleeper cells after Sept. 11 or the grand alliance of Putinists and homegrown white nationalists that's blamed for Donald Trump.

Meanwhile the extremes, in different but sometimes overlapping ways, are much more skeptical about American institutions, much more ""unpatriotic"" in the way that David Frum once dismissed right-wing critics of the Iraq war, and thus much more likely to be skeptical of any narrative that asks you to simply trust the wisdom and good intentions of, say, figures like James Comey and John Brennan.

This gives both the far left and the far right an advantage when it comes to seeing through the paranoias of the center -- even as both are tempted toward paranoias that locate all the evils of the world within the establishment, in the interlocking directorates of Washington and Wall Street or the military-industrial complex or the Brussels-Berlin axis.

Neither form of paranoia is necessarily worse or better than the other -- and neither, it should be stressed, is always wrong. The paranoid center tends to take real threats and then inflate them, rather than inventing them ex nihilo; the paranoid fringes tend to identify real establishment failures and corruptions but then over-imagine conspiracies and puppet masters.

But the paranoid center generally has a power that the fringes lack -- both the formal power of institutions and the cultural power to set narratives and declare the boundaries of legitimate debate. And this can make centrist paranoia more dangerous and more easily disguised.

Read the whole thing. Especially that last paragraph.

I didn't embrace either Russiagate narrative, because I didn't feel enough of a personal investment in the Mueller investigation to get into the weeds. However, I assumed that there probably was collusion with Russia, given how shady Paul Manafort is, and his longstanding, deep ties to people there, and given how morally lax Donald Trump always has been. But I didn't know that there was Russia collusion, and -- this is key -- I didn't want it to be true. Nor, I should say, did I feel strongly that I wanted it to be false. I didn't have strong feelings one way or the other, which is why you didn't see me writing about it much here.

Again, I will confess that I assumed it was probably true. I am happy to learn that it was not true, as every American should be. If you find that you are the sort of person who is disappointed to learn that your president did not collude with agents of a hostile foreign power to win the election, then something is wrong with you.

I remember well being caught up in the paranoid center back in 2002, during the march to war with Iraq. I've written about that here recently, and only repeat a bit of it here because lots of people come to these blog entries via social media, and don't have the running narrative that regular readers do. I believed the Iraq-has-WMD story because I wanted it to be true, to justify a war of vengeance against the Muslim world for 9/11. I believed the Iraq-has-WMD story because it was being told to me by establishment figures I trusted -- especially Colin Powell. I believed that story because everybody around me in the conservative Establishment believed it was true. The only reason you disbelieved it, and didn't want to go to war, was that you were either a fool or a coward.

If you weren't in the middle of all that then -- I was a New York-based writer for National Review -- it is very hard to imagine what it was like to be smack in the center of a universe where a lie was widely taken as truth. It may also be hard for you to imagine the courage it took for Pat Buchanan, Scott McConnell, and others involved in the founding of this magazine to do so in the face of overwhelming contempt from the conservative Establishment.

I've admired conservative journalist Mollie Hemingway's bulldog resistance to the collusion narrative, but it must have been so much harder for left-wing journalists like Glenn Greenwald to have resisted it, because so many people among their tribe wanted it to be true. If the past re: the Iraq War is any guide, Greenwald and his left-wing dissenters will not profit from having been correct on Russiagate, and those who are most prominent in Sohrab Ahmari's funny Mueller Madness bracket will continue to rise, as if this had never happened.

(As for Hemingway, she deserves her own interview show on Fox. I'm serious. She's a friend, and man, is she ever smart and funny and nobody's fool. The term ""dame"" was invented with women like her in mind.)

Anyway, Douthat is so very, very right about the paranoia of the center. I'm going to repeat his paragraph:

But the paranoid center generally has a power that the fringes lack -- both the formal power of institutions and the cultural power to set narratives and declare the boundaries of legitimate debate. And this can make centrist paranoia more dangerous and more easily disguised.

Having been on the inside of the boundary-setters on some issues, and on the outside of the boundary-setters on others, let me assure you that this is TRUE. For example, just think about how the transgender narrative colonized all the institutions and the cultural elites. If you disagree, you're a bona fide bigot. Motivated reasoning -- that is, looking for evidence to confirm what you want to believe -- is a problem for all of us, but when those with power engage in motivated reasoning, look out, because some bad stuff is about to go down.

One reason that all the establishment talk about ""diversity"" and ""inclusivity"" is so infuriating is because the people who are most enamored of it are the most rigid progressive dogmatists you can imagine. They don't want to know what they don't know, and don't want to hear from people who would contradict their narrative. If you really do believe that the American news media really cares about diversity in terms of viewpoints, you are living in a fantasy world. Their interest in ""diversity"" and ""inclusivity"" is motivated reasoning, all the way down, toward the goal of permanently excluding disfavored groups.

One more thing. I'll repeat Douthat here:

Because the center believes in the basic goodness of American and Western institutions, the basic wisdom and patriotism of their personnel, its threat matrix is always attuned to Great Enemies outside and radicals within...

That was me, prior to the Iraq War, and prior to the Catholic abuse scandal. I believed in the basic goodness of American institutions, of the Catholic Church, and of their personnel. I don't anymore, or at least not in the same way. It's not that I believe that America and its institutions are bad -- I do not believe that -- nor do I believe that the Catholic Church is bad. It's that I no longer take their goodness and trustworthiness for granted (or, if I'm honest, the goodness and trustworthiness of any institution, including the Orthodox Church, of which I am a communicant).

It's a crappy headspace to live in, because we all want to be able to rest in trust. There's a reason why Dante put traitors in the lowest pit of his Inferno: because those who rob the ability of the people to trust each other implicitly take away the most basic thing necessary for civilized life. You never really know whether the threat is coming from within, or without. Trying to find the sane and livable middle ground between wise skepticism and paranoia is difficult. It's so much easier to believe your own tribe, and refuse any information that doesn't confirm the narrative the tribe has embraced.

"""These people who are already insecure about losing their job switch on the TV, look at the newspaper and hear that they are being described as bigots, racists,"" Andrew Sullivan said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""And they resent it, and the one thing I would urge you people who do this type of content is try and complete the idea of 'the other' being in the room because they can hear what you are saying.""

THR also reports that Sullivan was eventually shouted at by an audience member.

Moments later, the author and New York magazine columnist doubled down on his idea, saying: ""Don't tell them everything is good. That you deserve it and that you are all basically slaveholders under their skin blah, blah, blah, which is what Hollywood is saying to them every second of the day."" Those comments, which were met with audible gasps, set the stage for an immensely tense 20-minute panel which ended in Sullivan being shouted at by an audience member, prompting the moderator to step in and end the panel.

He later told a reporter, ""When you're a struggling, white working-class person in say, Kentucky, and a Yale student says, 'You have white privilege,' what do you think happens? [Donald] Trump gets elected -- that's what happens.""

""And they don't seem to understand any of the lessons from the last time and I don't want [Trump] to be re-elected, but I don't think the left is helping and I don't think Hollywood is helping.""

Breitbart News has previously reported on Sullivan's contrarian takes on modern liberalism and the far-left in America.

Sullivan, who was born in England, is openly gay and has often been described as a ""conservative."" He argued for gay marriage decades before it was mainstream in the United States, and was criticized by left-leaning gay activists at the time who thought marriage would inappropriately ""mainstream"" gay people into straight culture.

He has repeatedly called out the current progressive movement for their fixation on intersectionality.

""(T)he animating goal of progressive politics is unvarnished race and gender warfare,"" Sullivan wrote last year.

""What matters before anything else is what race and gender you are, and therefore what side you are on. And in this neo-Marxist worldview, fully embraced by a hefty majority of the next generation, the very idea of America as a liberating experiment, dissolving tribal loyalties in a common journey toward individual opportunity, is anathema.""

The 55-year-old also slammed campus politics last year, arguing in a column, ""When elite universities shift their entire worldview away from liberal education as we have long known it toward the imperatives of an identity-based 'social justice' movement, the broader culture is in danger of drifting away from liberal democracy as well.""",60,Breitbart,Hollywood Heckles Andrew Sullivan for Defending Middle America at Inclusion Event
"Sen. Kamala Harris wants to give teachers across the country a raise.

In the first major proposal of her presidential campaign, the Democrat from California unveiled a plan on Tuesday to eliminate the teacher pay gap and give the average teacher a $13,500 per year raise.

The price tag for the ambitious plan? $315 billion over 10 years.

KAMALA HARRIS TAKES AIM AT BETO O'ROURKE

""We are not paying our teachers their value,"" Harris said in a statement. ""Teachers should not have to work two or three jobs to pay the bills. This proposal will lift up teachers and families across America, give every American teacher a raise, and make a much-needed investment in our country's future.""

Elementary, middle, and high schools obtain most of their funding from local and state governments, with Washington contributing less than 10 percent of funding. But Harris says if elected to the White House, she'll push for an immediate federal investment to provide 10 percent of the funding needed to close the teacher pay gap between teachers and professional workers with similar college degrees.

Harris is calling for the Department of Education to work with the states to set a base salary goal for entry-level teachers, with more advanced teachers seeing increases based on their years in the classroom. The proposal also includes additional federal funding for the country's highest-need schools and a multi-billion-dollar investment in programs that the Harris campaign says ""elevate the teaching profession and support principals and other school leaders.""

LATEST FOX NEWS 2020 POLL: BIDEN AND SANDERS REMAIN AT TOP OF FIELD

The campaign explained that the $315 billion plan would be paid ""by strengthening the estate tax and cracking down on loopholes that let the very wealthiest, with estates worth multiple millions or billions of dollars, avoid paying their fair share.""

The Republican National Committee called the plan ""another liberal pie-in-the-sky proposal that will never see the light of day.""

""With a $315 billion dollar price tag, no real plan to pay for it, and new spending mandates slapped on states, this proposal has big-government written all over it,"" RNC National Press Secretary Blair Ellis argued.

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS PRESIDENT TRUMP A RACIST

Calls for increasing teacher pay are nothing new in politics. For decades, school teachers have argued that they're underpaid and that the schools in which they work are underfunded by state and local governments.

But the issue's been increasingly in the national spotlight, with some high-profile walkouts over pay over the past year by teachers in more than half a dozen states. And teachers unions traditionally have been key players in Democratic Party politics.

The powerful American Federation of Teachers - which remains neutral in the wide-open race for the Democratic presidential nomination - predictably praised the Harris plan.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, is also pushing for increases in early education teacher pay as part of her plan to provide universal child care.

The average annual salary for a public school teacher during the 2016-2017 academic year was $58,950. That was down slightly from the previous year, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.

"There's a divide forming among left-of-center journalists. Some are dead-enders and truthers. They're dug into their foxholes on remote islands of the Philippines and they're prepared to keep fighting for another 50 years. David Leonhardt of the New York Times is usually an excellent exemplar of what non-crazy progressive thinkers are saying, but for two days he's been hinting darkly that Attorney General Barr's summation of the Mueller Report must be deliberately misleading and that the truths contained in it are likely to be far more damaging to President Trump than everyone presumed after the weekend's events. From Leonhardt's newsletter this morning:

But I think much of the media was too credulous about Barr's letter, producing banner headlines and chyrons that treated it as an objective summary of Mueller's work rather than as a political document meant to make President Trump look good. And it was very much a political document.

Barr, the attorney general, works for Trump. [etc.]

There is a lot of this going around, but other left-of-center voices are saying: Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge something. Trump was legitimately elected. He is not Putin's stooge. He didn't get to the White House by cheating. Let's talk about how the United States got to the point where Trump was our choice. Even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (!) is saying this. In her fashion.

There was no collusion. The president was not a Manchurian candidate. And we can't lay the blame for this whole thing on Vladimir Putin.

Indeed, the truest horror in Mr. Mueller's finding is that we did not need Mr. Putin to be pulling the strings. We know now that under our shambolic democracy, a man as unfit as Mr. Trump really can legitimately acquire all the terrifying powers of the presidency without being controlled by a foreign puppet master.

Unlike Leonhardt, Ryan Lizza of CNN (who said the media's Russia coverage was ""somewhere between about right and not quite aggressive enough""), Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post and other apologists, Manjoo calls for a reckoning in the media. He says Mueller's report

lands like a rotten egg on a political and media establishment that had gone all-in on its own self-serving -- and wrong -- theory of the case. Before we embark on yet more investigations, it is worth examining, now, why the collusion fantasy proved so irresistible to so many of us -- and what we all might have done with our time instead.

David Brooks, not exactly a member of the MAGA chorus, takes the measure of how scandal-based politics substitutes for thinking, arguing, persuading. He writes:

The sad fact is that Watergate introduced a poison into the American body politic. Richard Nixon's downfall was just and important, but it opened up the mouthwatering possibility that you don't need to do the hard work of persuading people to join your side.

McGregor was suspended from UFC for six months for a post-match brawl that erupted after UFC 229. That suspension ends April 6. He also recently had an incident where he smashed a fan's phone.

If he stays retired, McGregor finishes with a 21-4 record in Mixed Martial Arts and a 9-2 record in UFC. He won two division championships.

UFC President Dana White said the announcement ""totally makes sense.""

""He has the money to retire, and his [Proper 12] whiskey is KILLIN' it,"" White told ESPN via text. ""It totally makes sense. If I was him, I would retire too. He's retiring from fighting.

"Australia's One Nation party accused asking NRA for money in bid for increased political power

Australian right-wing party officials have blamed alcohol after they were apparently caught seeking a donation from the U.S. National Rifle Association in an effort to lobby a change in gun laws in the country.

The One Nation party was criticized by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday for trying to ""sell Australia's gun laws to the highest bidders"" after asking for the donations.

The criticism came after an Al Jazeera undercover documentary in which One Nation party officials, Steve Dickson and James Ashby, flew to the U.S. and met with NRA officials.

AUSTRALIAN SENATOR WHO CAME UNDER FIRE FOR BLAMING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION FOR SHOOTINGS PUNCHES TEEN AFTER HE WAS EGGED

They were caught allegedly asking for financial support just weeks before the Australian Parliament banned foreign political donations.

But the party defended itself this week, blaming alcohol for the officials' loose tongues and slammed the broadcaster for putting their comments out of context.

""These conversations with the NRA were to look at nothing more than their techniques,"" Ashby told reporters, adding that the trips he made were about learning about the ways President Trump won the election in 2016.

""These conversations with the NRA were to look at nothing more than their techniques. This was not about sourcing money from the NRA, this was about sourcing technology, an understanding of how they operate, but never was it about seeking $20 million from the NRA.""

-- James Ashby

""This was not about sourcing money from the NRA, this was about sourcing technology, an understanding of how they operate, but never was it about seeking $20 million from the NRA,"" he continued.

""The conversations that have been recorded where there is talk of $10 and $20 million dollars -- I'll be the first to admit, we'd arrived in America, we'd got on the sauce, we'd had a few drinks. And that's where those discussions took place. Not with any potential donors. No one but Rodger Muller, Steve Dickson and myself.""

DEMS WANT $50 MILLION FOR BIASED RESEARCH TO ATTACK GUN OWNERSHIP

The broadcaster was able to catch the One Nation officials after one of their journalists, Rodger Muller, pretended to be a grassroots gun rights activists in the U.S. who set up a meeting with the NRA, which he then covertly filmed.

Dickson, the other One Nation party official recorded at the meeting, said they hadn't broken any rules during their trip to the U.S. and reiterated that the comments were made under the influence of alcohol.

""Just to clarify a lot of this. We've landed in the United States, this trip has been organized by Rodger Muller -- who again, I want to make this point very clearly, was employed by a Middle Eastern country, Al Jazeera, to come to Australia as a spy to infiltrate into Australian politics.""

""There are many, many things that were videoed, and I believe a lot of those things were taken out of sequence,"" he continued.

""Americans all over the country are asking when our leaders, from every party, are going to put aside partisan politics and work to address the challenges that are threatening American lives and livelihoods,"" Gabbard continued.

"Virtually everyone in politics and media was stunned Sunday afternoon as the Department of Justice announced Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Donald Trump or his campaign associates colluding or conspiring with Russian nationals.

Everyone, that is, except for alternative media like Breitbart News -- which for years called out rumors and conspiracy theories, facing ridicule from establishment outlets for defying their provincial speculation dressed up as facts and analysis. As Mueller's investigation wraps up, the ""experts"" were wrong -- again -- and if there is one ""told you so"" moment that sums up this entire media humiliation, it comes from one of the rare television appearances by Alex Marlow, Breitbart News' Editor in Chief.

June 2017 on HBO's Real Time, Marlow spoke with host Bill Maher, who tried to cajole him into agreeing with the conventional wisdom of the time: ""you cannot claim to me that they did all this shit with the hacking and the emails and it didn't tip the election."" Marlow shot back that ""hard evidence"" of collusion ""does not exist"" and pledged that he would return to show to ""eat crow"" if his assertion was proven false.

The Special Counsel's findings killed any leftist viewers' hopes for that particular public shaming. Last Friday evening, Maher appeared unfazed by early reports that Mueller would not file any more charges. ""I don't need the Mueller report to know he's a traitor,"" he quipped during his weekly broadcast. ""I have a TV.""

In that wide-ranging 2017 interview, the pair discussed Breitbart News' coverage, Russia, the establishment media, and free speech.

On the topic of Russia's alleged interference in the last election, Marlow told Maher that Breitbart doesn't cover the subject aggressively akin to the vast number of news outlets because there is no proof of collusion by the Trump campaign, but noted that the site does report important stories on the subject.

""We don't cover it because every other outlet in the world, particularly the left-of-center outlets, which are the vast, vast, vast, number of news outlets, are obsessed with this story, covering it around the clock by nine months,"" Marlow said.

""But not at all, Alex?"" asked Maher.

""We cover it a little if something big -- if there's something that breaks that is a big, important story -- but we don't have any evidence of collusion. We don't have any evidence of obstruction of justice, yet,"" Marlow replied.

Seemingly unsatisfied with Marlow's unwillingness to hype the ""Russia Collusion"" narrative, the HBO host pressed him on Russia's hacking and subsequent release of emails from the Democrat National Committee. Marlow said that while he concurred Russia attempted to impact the election's results, there was no proof the Trump campaign asked for or needed their help to defeat Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

""There's no doubt about it that Russia wanted to sow discord in the United States. They want us to lose faith in our institutions. But what's happening with this story is we're nine months in, no hard evidence of collusion,"" he stated, before adding, ""If you present evidence of collusion Bill, I'll come back on your show and eat some crow.""

Marlow then chided the establishment media for choosing to cover the ""Russia collusion"" story, rather than President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" agenda.

""You guys continue to talk about this story in the establishment press instead of talking about the president's agenda, which is by design. Because you guys won't apologize if it turns out there's nothing, no one will come out on MSNBC, they'll just move on to the next hysteria, and that's a huge advantage for people like me who are covering the rest of the news,"" he said.

Following the release of the Mueller report summary, various high-profile media figures have done just that -- refuse to apologize for their insistent hyping of the collusion narrative and instead moved their goalposts. On Monday morning, the New York Times' Michael Schmidt said the Mueller probe appears incomplete because President Trump was not exonerated of obstruction of justice, and raised questions about the special counsel's decision not to interview the president in person. However, instead of an interview, Mueller accepted written answers submitted by President Trump through his legal team.

""I understand why legally that may not have happened and it's hard to subpoena the President and there's real difficulties in that,"" Schmidt said of Mueller's decision to complete the president for an in-person interview. ""But if you're the average person and you're looking at this you're saying, hold on a second. They looked all of the things about the guy's intent and he didn't have to answer any questions and they never subpoenaed him? That's not a satisfying answer.""

In another case of goal-post moving, Mother Jones' David Corn told MSNBC host Ari Melber that the Mueller probe was ill-equipped to determine whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, saying the investigation was ""not a good process for getting to the truth.""

Meanwhile, some media figures refuse to accept Mueller's findings and are still spinning theories of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Sunday questioned why President Trump and his associates made false statements during the investigation, suggesting that Mueller may not have all the facts about collusion.

""I think one of the questions that will remain for quite some time is that if there was no collusion, and we can be convinced of that today, why did Donald Trump, and why did his administration and why did everybody close to him lie about contacts that they had with Russia throughout the course of the campaign? I guess the answer to that may just be pure, basic greed. He wanted to build a tower in Moscow,"" he declared.",66,Breitbart,Called Shot: Breitbart's Alex Marlow Predicted Russia Hoax Outcome in 2017

The man who saved Japan's cherry trees: ""Almost all lords brought cherries -- wild and cultivated -- from their principalities with them. And so in Edo gardens -- in varying blossom colours, petal numbers and tree shapes -- Japan's diverse cultures, traditions, climates and peoples were represented and celebrated. For months at a time, blossoms of the different varieties, which each bloomed at different times of the year, would put on colourful displays.Today, however, Tokyo's cherry trees are known for their synchronous blossoming. Along the Arakawa River, great rows of trees turn pink for eight days only, each April. In unison, here and elsewhere in Japan, their blossoms bloom and then die quickly, symbolising the beauty and fleeting transience of life. The cherry trees of contemporary Japan are not a diverse mix. They are mostly just one species -- the somei-yoshino, a cultivated variety with single pink blossoms that bloom on bare branches. Naoko Abe concerns herself with two things in this book, first published in 2016 in Japanese. She investigates how, when and why this change took place; and she traces the life and work of an English ornithologist-turned-cherry-tree-specialist, Collingwood Ingram, born in 1880, who was responsible for saving many of the varieties of Japanese cherry that would otherwise probably have become extinct.""

Can light verse be serious? Patrick Kurp argues it can in The Los Angeles Review of Books: ""Some of us never outgrow our childhood pleasures, guilty or otherwise. But only in the last half-century or so has light verse become less than respectable among readers, poets, and critics, and less ubiquitous in popular culture. The New Yorker featured it for decades, making Ogden Nash a household name. Millions of non-poetry readers can still quote him: 'Candy / Is dandy, / But liquor / Is quicker.' Phyllis McGinley, one of the best-known light verse writers of her day, published in Ladies Home Journal (and The New Yorker), and won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1961. Kingsley Amis, himself an enthusiast and practitioner of the form, described the highest aspirations of light verse as 'genial, memorable, enlivening and funny.' Still, some readers and critics maintain that light verse isn't real poetry. It's kids' stuff, doggerel, greeting-card fodder, unhappy echoes of Richard Armour, whose whimsical riffs appeared in Sunday newspaper supplements starting in the Great Depression.""

Christian Gonzalez writes about a debate over the Western canon at Columbia: ""A fascinating though regrettable consequence of Stalnaker's argument is that it reduces the canon debate at Columbia to a curious binary: radical students who would like to see the Core abolished on one side, versus the Columbia establishment that hopes to preserve the Core on the other. The former insists that the Western canon propagates white supremacy and should therefore not be read; the latter counters by agreeing that while, yes, the canon is characterized by 'gaps, exclusions, and fictions,' it is still worth engaging with it, the better to subvert and criticize it. Those who believe that the canon ought to be read simply because it is our patrimony as residents of a Western nation are rendered voiceless in the discussion. Such a perspective is not considered legitimate. Instead, the debate takes place almost entirely between different factions of the Left, each of them holding a basically disparaging view of the canon. In the meantime, everybody else is forced to spectate from the sidelines, waiting as the Left resolves what's merely an internal disagreement.""

Graphic adaptations of literary works are becoming more popular. Julian Peters recently finished his graphic version of T. S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."" A few years ago Tim Hamilton illustrated Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Now we have Dan Parsons and Jennifer Grossman's adaptation of Ayn Rand's Anthem. Check it out.

Michael Schaub praises Amy Hempel's latest collection of short stories: ""Hempel occasionally draws comparisons to authors like Mary Robison and Joy Williams, but she writes like nobody else -- she's an irreplaceable literary treasure who has mastered the art of the short story more skillfully than just about any other writer out there. Sing to It is a quiet masterpiece by a true American original.""

Thomas Kidd recommends a recent article on Presbyterian jerks: ""Douglas Winiarski (Univ. of Richmond) has a remarkable article in the latest William and Mary Quarterly on the history of the jerking exercise, or the 'jerks,' in the Second Great Awakening. Religious historians since the 1800s have often alluded to outbreaks of the jerks in the revivals, but until Winiarski, we have only had a vague sense of where the jerks happened, how often, and among what groups...The jerks, however, were dramatic and apparently uncontrollable physical manifestations that originated in specific places and among specific groups in the early phases of the Second Great Awakening. Perhaps counterintuitively, these 'somatic' (bodily) exercises commenced in the early 1800s among Presbyterians, especially Scots-Irish Presbyterians of the trans-Appalachian Upper South. Although we often think of Presbyterians as one of the most cerebral of the historic evangelical traditions (in contrast to Methodists and Baptists), Winiarkski paints a picture of some Presbyterians as proto-Pentecostals.""

Essay of the Day:

Discussing artists or works in terms of periods (like ""modern"") or even centuries is usually unhelpful. Artists do what they do, year after year, and while ""times"" change, people don't. Occasionally, though, period terms can be helpful in highlighting the particularities of individual artists. Such is the case (for the most part!) in Simon Morrison's piece on Tchaikovsky in The Times Literary Supplement. Tchaikovsky, Morrison argues, was a man of the eighteenth century. His music, however, anticipates modern composition:

""In the final years of his short life, Tchaikovsky gained almost cult-like status among the Symbolists. He was described in the Symbolist journal Ves√Ø (Libra) as a modernist seer and polestar of Zukunftsmusik, the music of the future. Given Tchaikovsky's French Classical allegiances, Musique de l'avenir might have been more appropriate. But the German term, borrowed from Richard Wagner, was fairly applied to Tchaikovsky's expansive final opera Iolanta, first performed on a double bill with The Nutcracker in 1892.

""Iolanta, based on Henrik Hertz's play Kong Ren√©s Datter, King Ren√©'s Daughter (1845), begins in a garden. The innocent heroine is thought to be blind (though never called as such) by the people minding her. Her caring, if oppressive, father wants her cured of her condition, but the mystic he recruits for the task fails, offering little besides talk about ""the two worlds of the flesh and the spirit"" above an ostinato, a sustained, two-minute-long crescendo, and a pile of Eastern mystical musical clich√©s. The character, based on a real person, is not from the East at all, but is a moor - a Muslim from North Africa named Ibn-Hakia, aka Ibn al-Haytham. Ibn-Hakia was a tenth-century astronomer, mathematician and physicist whose contributions to optical science remain relevant today. Eventually the right fellow, a Burgundian knight, comes along and the power of his love seems to restore Iolanta's sight. The cure is enacted at sunset.

""Iolanta is, among other things, about innocence (represented by harp, halos of strings, and the heroine's sweetly consonant singing) and experience (the dissonant orchestral undergirding of the fourth number, King Ren√©'s arioso). Tchaikovsky turned to Wagner's music dramas for models of a knowing chromatic music, yet his subversive handling of Wagner reverses the terms that Wagner himself set out. In Iolanta, experience seems over-rated; instead, the innocent are the more profound. The brief overture to Iolanta is an upside-down, woodwind-dominated paraphrase of the opening of the Tristan und Isolde prelude. (One of the characters in Hertz's play, not Tchaikovsky's opera, is called Tristan.) Far from a deferential Russian homage to Wagner, however, Tchaikovsky's music offers an insubordinate critique. The discordant, disquieted overture represents groping in the dark - not Iolanta's, but Wagner's. She will demonstrate that she possesses the things that her father and the other people who pity her will never have: namely, insight. She possesses a spiritual vision - as does, by extension, Tchaikovsky himself.

""The Nutcracker, although commercialized for Christmas, bears political import in Russia. The scholar of music and politics Damien Mahiet compares the second act, which features dances in the land of the sweets, to a ballet des nations and interprets the entire work as a celebration of the Franco-Russian Alliance under Tsar Alexander III. By this point in his career Tchaikovsky was a patriotically imperial composer. Yet the ballet also bears a deeply personal dimension. Tchaikovsky completed The Nutcracker after the death of his sister Aleksandra, and freighted the score with acoustic memories of a person and a place - Aleksandra's house in Kamenka - that Tchaikovsky's brother Modest recalled as sacred relics. The ""Chinese"" dance has nothing to do with China, but everything to do with the whistle of a teakettle in the kitchen. Roland John Wiley, a musicologist specializing in Tchaikovsky's ballets, hears refrains of the panikhida, the Russian Orthodox service for the departed, in the score, suggesting nostalgia in its truest sense: painful and irremediable rather than bittersweet. The famous celesta that accompanies the Sugar Plum Fairy, representative of the cold brightness of the Silver Age, may also evoke a stranger image - metal teardrops. In his essay ""Tchaikovsky and the Russian 'Silver Age'"", the musicologist Arkadiy Klimovitsky connects the magic lantern ""phantasmagoria"" of the ""Waltz of the Snowflakes"" with the tone painting of the impressionists and poems about blizzards and dancing masks. The consistent compound rhythms would have taxed the choreographers of the ballet, Marius Petipa and his disciple Lev Ivanov, as the asymmetrical rhythmic patterns in The Sleeping Beauty had previously. The ""Waltz of the Snowflakes"" is surrealistically not a waltz, but a fateful chaconne consisting of eight variations of a theme. Klimovitsky invokes a poem by the Symbolist Alexander Blok to explain The Nutcracker: throw open the door, the poet tells us on Tchaikovsky's behalf, leave sadness behind and dissolve into the whiteout.

""Of course the idea that Tchaikovsky anticipated the experimentalism of the Symbolists and Surrealists runs counter to his conservatism as a person and as an artist, his reverence for the music of eighteenth-century composers, reliance on the number format in his operas, general adherence to the diatonic system, and predilection for German augmented sixth chords. But he embraced these things in order to counter them, or to highlight and enhance them with his own unmistakable signature. In his late works, meters are scrambled and gestures displaced over the registers before fading into nothingness. Lives, Tchaikovsky believed, should have the textures of dreams.""",67,The American Conservative,"Saving Japan's Cherry Blossoms, in Defense of Light Verse, and Victorian Dogs"
"WASHINGTON -- In the first major policy proposal of her presidential campaign, Sen. Kamala Harris of California is focused on boosting the salaries of teachers.

Harris' campaign says her plan is an unprecedented investment in teacher pay and toward programs dedicated to teacher recruitment, training and professional development. In new details released Tuesday, the Democrat's campaign described the underpayment of teachers as a ""national failure that's holding America back"" and said that ""we've failed to give teachers the respect and resources they deserve.""

The issue is hardly new. For years, teachers have said they are underpaid and their schools are underfunded. Seeking higher pay and more education funding, teachers in more than a half-dozen states have walked out of their classrooms in protest. But in wading into the education spending debate in her first policy rollout, Harris is set to capitalize on a debate that has been boiling in districts across the country and that is critical to the nation's teachers unions, which have largely been key players in Democratic Party politics.

Harris previewed her plan in a Houston speech Saturday, saying that ""you can judge a society by the way it treats its children, and one of the greatest expressions of love that a society can give to its children is educating those children with resources they need.""

Traditionally, elementary and secondary schools receive most of their funding from state and local governments, with the federal government providing less than 10 percent of total spending. But Harris is calling for the federal government to immediately invest a base level of funding into each state with the goal of closing the teacher pay gap -- the difference in compensation for teachers and similar professionals with college degrees. Then, Harris' campaign says, for every $1 a state contributes to increasing the pay of teachers, the federal government will invest an additional $3.

Harris' campaign says that under the plan the average teacher in America will receive a $13,500 raise.

The campaign estimates this will cost $315 billion over a decade, paid for by strengthening the estate tax and closing tax loopholes that benefit the rich.

While it is early in the Democratic primary and the American Federation of Teachers has not backed any Democrat running for president, the head of the AFT praised Harris' plan.

Randi Weingarten, the group's president, said in an interview that there's been a ""woeful underinvestment in public schools throughout the country"" and that Harris had proposed a ""bold, smart, strategic and decisive proposal that will help solve the problem of how we recruit and retain great teachers.""

""What she's doing is saying personnel is absolutely key in terms of teaching, and she is investing in our personnel, she's investing in teaching,"" she said.

Catherine Brown, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, said that states have been systemically disinvesting in public education for a decade, particularly in more conservative parts of the country.

""I think it would be better if states would step up and pay teachers what they deserve. I think we can all agree it's a very hard job, a foundational job to our democracy, and they are underpaid,"" she said. ""I think that states are not stepping up -- in particular, conservative states. What we've seen are states led by GOP leaders have disinvested in education systematically in favor of giving tax cuts.""

The issue of teacher pay and education spending has been cause for strikes in a number of states. In Harris' hometown of Oakland, striking teachers recently went back to their classrooms following a weeklong strike after union members voted to approve a contract agreement that provided pay raises.

In 2016-17, the average annual salary for a public school teacher was $58,950, down slightly from the previous year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, though that figure differs state to state.

Overall, 78 percent of Americans said that's not enough, according to an April 2018 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Just 15 percent think teachers are paid the right amount, while 6 percent think they're paid too much.

Harris' campaign emphasized that this is a national issue, affecting both urban centers and rural schools, but explicitly singled out the area along Interstate 95 in South Carolina known as the ""Corridor of Shame"" because of its underperforming schools. The region gained that name from a 2005 documentary that depicted decrepit conditions and deteriorating buildings.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recently toured the region, and South Carolina lawmakers have said improving the state's education system is a priority this year. On her own South Carolina trip in February, Harris weighed in on the teacher pay issue.

""You know, right here in South Carolina, we need to pay our teachers what they are worth,"" Harris told attendees at a North Charleston town hall, adding later: ""For most of us who ever have a microphone like this in our hands, we have never achieved this kind of success without the teachers and the public education system that made us who we are.""

Harris' plan also includes investments in teacher recruitment, training, retention and professional development, her campaign says. It says there will be a multibillion-dollar investment in programs at historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions.",68,New York Post,Kamala Harris promises raises for teachers if elected
"How the speaker of the House of Commons became the most contentious MP in Parliament

In British politics, the job of the speaker of the House of Commons is to chair debates in Parliament from a position of total impartiality. Throughout the Brexit process, some have claimed (with good reason) that Speaker John Bercow is not merely partial but has aimed to steer Brexit in the direction of the Remain-voting establishment.

On January 9 Bercow caused great controversy when he changed the rules for Parliament's ""meaningful vote."" Proposed by former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the new amendment gave the government just three days - as opposed to the original three weeks - to decide on its next steps should Theresa May's deal be voted down. (It was voted down.) The effect of this amendment was to take control of the Brexit process from the government and give it back to Parliament. The trouble is that Parliament is too conflicted to get anything done.

Another trouble is that many conservative members of Parliament took Bercow's actions to be evidence of pro-Labour bias. For instance, one MP asked him why his car has a derogatory anti-Brexit sticker - ""b*llocks to Brexit, it's not a done deal"" - but the speaker merely replied that the vehicle belongs to his wife. This might be true, but the Daily Telegraph reported last year that he had told a number of students that he had voted Remain. And this month he also prevented a parliamentary vote on whether to block a second referendum (which keeps this option on the table for anti-Brexit MPs).

Another controversy arose this month when Bercow cited a law dating back to 1604 that would prevent the government from voting a third time on May's withdrawal deal unless significant changes have been made to it. Significantly, this seemed to please both ardent Brexiteers and those who want to stop Brexit. Both groups are unified in opposition to May's Brexit-in-name-only deal.

After May had given a speech blaming members of Parliament for a Brexit delay - Britain is now scheduled to leave on April 12 rather than March 29 - Bercow told Parliament:

None of you is a traitor. All of you are doing your best. This should not be and I'm sure will not prove to be a matter of any controversy whatsoever. From the chair let me say that I believe passionately in the institution of parliament. In the rights of members of the house. And in their commitment to their duty. And I use the word ""duty"" in the singular advisedly. The sole duty of every member of Parliament is to do what he or she thinks is right.

What did he mean by this? At face value, Bercow claims that he is not partisan but simply likes speaking truth to power.

Bercow vetoed the suggestion of an address to both houses of Parliament by the president of the United States, Donald Trump, on a state visit. In May 2013, Bercow broke parliamentary precedent in favor of Tory skeptic MPs by allowing them to debate whether or not there should be a referendum to leave the EU. Though this motion didn't pass, it did set the ball rolling - the ball David Cameron later kicked off the cliff when he announced the EU referendum. In December 2018, Bercow allowed a motion on whether the government was in contempt of Parliament when it refused to make public the official legal advice on its Brexit deal.

But perhaps Bercow just enjoys exercising his own power and being the source of so much controversy. For instance, when Jeremy Corbyn was caught mumbling the words ""stupid woman"" about Theresa May, Bercow faced accusations of similar comments and bullying. Whether or not this will turn out to be Bercow's Brexit remains to be seen. But his behavior does raise questions as to why one person, who is supposed to be chairing a debate, has so much say in such a monumental process.",69,nationalreview.com,John Bercow and Brexit | National Review
"Besides being the right thing to do, it could reawaken Americans to the necessity of our Constitution's federalist principles.

Democrats are in charge of the House of Representatives once again, and so they have placed a bill on the House floor that would admit the District of Columbia to the Union as a state. The political motivations are clear. The new state -- for which they propose the unwieldy name ""State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth"" -- would be reliably Democratic, adding two senators and one representative to the party's totals.

There are plenty of reasons to oppose this precise solution, but the issue of taxpaying Americans' not having a representative voice in Congress is not easily dismissed. And if Congress wants to address that issue, Puerto Rico, not the District of Columbia, should become our 51st state.

Republicans have reason to support such a move along with Democrats. The GOP party platform has favored Puerto Rican statehood for decades, but Republicans have remained wary of acting on the issue, convinced that Puerto Rico, like D.C., would be a reliably blue state. That's not exactly true. Puerto Rico had a Republican-affiliated governor as recently as 2013, and its current nonvoting delegate to Congress, Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n, is a Republican. If Puerto Rico became a state, it is reasonable to believe that Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n or another Republican would take one of the island's two seats in the Senate.

Puerto Rican statehood, besides being the right thing to do on the merits, would also enhance the nation's appreciation of federalism and further entrench the conservative value of local control. Puerto Rico differs in significant ways from the rest of the United States, but this should be seen as an asset, not a liability. Admitting it to the union would increase diversity among the states, forcing us to question whether one-size-fits-all federal laws are the best way to govern an increasingly varied people.

Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony from its discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1493 until Spain ceded it to the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1899. Other parts of the United States were once Spanish colonies, including Florida and the entire Southwest.

Those lands were sparsely populated, though, which meant that an influx of English-speaking Americans overwhelmed the existing Spanish and Native American populations, making them demographically similar to the rest of the country relatively quickly.

This was not the case in Puerto Rico. The island's population at annexation was nearly 1 million, and while some English-speaking people moved to the new colony, they were always a minority. (Even today, roughly 95 percent of Puerto Rico residents speak Spanish as their primary language.) There were religious differences at annexation, too, as the island was majority-Catholic while the rest of the United States was overwhelmingly Protestant, despite several decades of heavy immigration from Catholic countries in Europe.

These differences may have accounted, along with then-prevailing racial prejudices, for the ambiguous status of Puerto Rico within the American nation. In 1917, Congress extended American citizenship to anyone born on the island after 1898. In doing so, it recognized that the island was a permanent part of America, while also conveniently allowing draft-age men there to be conscripted as the nation entered the First World War.

Under a constitution adopted in 1952, Puerto Rico chose to continue the ambiguous status quo. In that document, the island is called a ""commonwealth,"" and the term has come to signify the relationship that exists between Puerto Rico and the federal government -- a free, associated state whose people are Americans but lack some of the political rights of Americans who live in the 50 states. After five referendums with varying wording and results, that relationship continues to this day.

In 2017, Puerto Rican voters chose statehood in a referendum on the island's status. It was the fifth referendum in the past 50 years, but, owing perhaps to its low-turnout or perhaps to Congress's reluctance, no offer of statehood was extended by the federal government, nor did the Puerto Rican government formally request a change in status from free association to full membership in the American union.

That leaves the exact legal status of Puerto Rico in limbo, but the island and its residents are without a doubt a part of America. Puerto Ricans are Americans. They serve in our military and contribute to our nation. Yet they lack the voting rights that Americans in the 50 states take for granted. Statehood would rectify that problem, integrating Puerto Rico more closely into the nation of which it is already a part.

These points have all been made before by statehood advocates, and they alone would justify granting statehood to Puerto Rico. What is often unsaid is that making Puerto Rico the 51st state would also be good for the rest of America in one specific way: It would remind us why we are a federal republic.

Modern advocates of unitary government like to say that states are meaningless nowadays, that the differences between them are so minute that there is no point in honoring them. This was not the attitude of the Founding Fathers, many of whom found even the limited central government imposed by the Constitution to be threatening to the local distinctions between what had originally been separate colonies.

It seems trivial to point out now, but there were serious cultural differences among the 13 colonies even when all were majority-Protestant and majority-English. Puritan Massachusetts, Quaker Pennsylvania, and Anglican South Carolina did not view themselves as the same. Sizable ethnic (the Dutch in New York, the Germans in Pennsylvania) and religious (the Catholics in Maryland) minorities added to colonial diversity. Federalism, though primarily a political measure, also worked to preserve these unique subcultures of early America.

As the nation grew, the states became more diverse. Louisiana was a French colony when the United States acquired it in 1803, and that distinctive colonial heritage still flavors the culture and the law there today. The Southwest, as already mentioned, was historically Spanish, and Hawaii had a long history as an independent kingdom before being annexed by the United States in 1898. Although our nation's cultural differences are less acute than they once were, thanks to internal migration and homogenized mass media, the states still vary from one another. Federalism helps maintain that variation within a united republic.

Federalism would help preserve Puerto Rico's culture even as the island would become more deeply integrated with the rest of America. Indeed, Puerto Rico's representatives in Congress would probably call for guarantees of federalism to make sure of that. Although many in the Republican party believe that the island would be thoroughly Democratic as a state, Puerto Rican politicians would not be keen on the national Democratic party's penchant for consolidating power in Washington, D.C.

To see how federalism would look if Puerto Rico were admitted as a state, we need only examine our neighbor to the north, Canada.

In most respects, Canadians are just like Americans: a majority-English-speaking, majority-Protestant people living in a collection of former British colonies. The exception to the rule is Quebec. When Canada began the gradual process of securing independence from the United Kingdom, federalism was seen as the only way to unite the English-speaking Protestant provinces with the French-speaking Catholic one. And while the differences between Catholic and Protestant are less important to most people nowadays, the differences between French- and English-speaking Canadians remain and have helped preserve the federal nature of Canada's union when other centralizing, progressive trends in Canadian politics might have destroyed it.

Even when Canada's government is to the left of ours, federalism is maintained, with foreign affairs and economic policy mostly handled in Ottawa and cultural and educational matters dealt with at the provincial level. We think of Canada and the U.K. as both having socialized health care, and that's true. But the two systems are not managed the same way. Britain's National Health Service is the sort of top-down model that conservatives in this country fear; Canada's model is managed by the provinces, not unlike our Medicare system. Both systems would probably entail too much government intrusion for most Americans, but the Canadian version offers more local control, and works better, than Britain's.

Changes in Canadian governance over the years have involved negotiations between the provinces and the federal government. Disputes over federalism led to conventions between provinces, not just debates in the federal legislature. In the Meech Lake Accord in 1987 and the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, these compromises failed, but even failure in such a scenario is better than huge top-down reforms rammed through without regard for local concerns.

A more diverse conglomeration of states would likely lead to similar demands for more local autonomy, which could not come at a better time. The United States government has grown too big and centralized to be controlled by a single executive. Greater variation in geography, size, and culture among the states would force us to appreciate anew the need for federalism and might even lead to a more clearly defined division of powers between the different sovereignties, as found in Part VI of Canada's 1867 constitution.

A century of drift away from the American Constitution's vital federalist principles has left them ripe for rediscovery and renewal. Adding a new state to the Union, especially one already accustomed to remaining culturally distinct within the American nation, would spur that process forward. Congress should admit Puerto Rico as a state, and Americans as a whole should embrace the differences within our nation and the federal structure that allows them to coexist in peace.",70,nationalreview.com,A Conservative Case for Puerto Rican Statehood | National Review
"NO APOLOGIES FROM CNN, MAINSTREAM MEDIA: CNN, MSNBC and other members of the mainstream media are not apologizing for the way they covered President Trump and the Russia collusion investigation ...Some pundits on CNN, like former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, are defending their years of analysis while others are mostly remaining silent on their coverage. Rudy Giuliani, in a heated interview Monday with CNN's Chris Cuomo, demanded that the network apologize; Cuomo refused. Some members of the mainstream media suggested that Trump was the one who should apologize - to Robert Mueller for trashing his investigation as a ""witch hunt"" for two years.

Either way, the end of the Mueller investigation is not the end of the story. Democrats want the Justice Department to release Mueller's entire report. Meanwhile, Trump allies are awaiting the results of two long-running internal probes that could expose the backstory behind the Russia probe's beginnings -- and provide more detail on documented misconduct among top FBI and DOJ officials.

AVALANCHE OF TROUBLE FOR AVENATTI - AND HE SUGGESTS TRUMP IS TO BLAME: Michael Avenatti, former attorney for adult entertainment star Stormy Daniels, is free on $300,000 bond Tuesday as he faces serious charges in two separate federal cases in New York and Los Angeles ... In New York, he is accused of attempting to extort between $15 and $25 million from sports apparel giant Nike. A suspected co-conspirator working alongside Avenatti in the alleged extortion was identified Monday by the Associated Press and Wall Street Journal as now-former CNN contributor Mark Geragos, who has represented celebrities including Michael Jackson and more recently, ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett.

In addition, Avenatti is charged with wire fraud and bank fraud in a separate case out of California. In a statement to Fox News late Monday, Avenatti suggested the California case against him is politically-motivated and has ties to the Trump administration.

FUNDS TO 'BUILD THAT WALL' OK'ED: The Pentagon notified Congress late Monday that it authorized the transfer of up to $1 billion to erect 57 miles of ""pedestrian fencing"" along the U.S.-Mexico border in direct support of President Trump's national emergency declaration from last month ... The fencing, which will be 18 feet high, is to be erected in the Yuma and El Paso sectors, the statement read. The Pentagon's announcement was made as Trump nears a victory over Democrats as the House tries to override his first veto, a vote that seems certain to fail and allow his declaration to stand. The vote, which is set for Tuesday, would keep Trump's border emergency declaration intact.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer (Reuters)

The November midterm elections were perhaps the most consequential midterms that I have experienced in my politically active lifetime - and we Democrats took no prisoners.

? 7 governor offices flipped (more governor offices flipped by any party since 1994)

? 7 new state legislative majorities and 8 this cycle

? 5 Republican supermajorities in state legislatures broken this cycle

? More than 390 state legislative seats flipped this cycle

Many factors attributed to our 2018 midterm success. But two of those factors stand out as having carried the lion's share of the load:

WAS DEMOCRATS' OBSESSION OVER TRUMP AND RUSSIA WORTH IT FOR THEIR PARTY?

First, the most loyal voting bloc in our party, African-American voters, not only showed up but showed out in a big way. And African-American women carried the load.

Secondly, Democrats across the nation focused on the five M's for campaign success: Messengers, Message, Money, Mobilization and Momentum.

Got it? Good. Because this article isn't about how we won in November. This is about what happens next.

You see, in the weeks and months immediately following Election Day, I became deeply concerned that we would fall back into the old patterns of political gamesmanship that has too often plagued our 230-year-old republic.

The simple truth is that the American people sentenced the Republican Party to at least two years of hard time in the House minority because they failed to pass a policy agenda that would directly improve the quality of life for everyone, especially middle-income working families and the working poor. We cannot afford to repeat their political sins, or we too will find ourselves cast aside in 2020.

I worried that the conventional wisdom that demanded our new majority to do unto them (Republicans and President Trump) as they have done or would do to us would prevail, thrusting us once again into the tit-for-tat that hardens already hardline positions and serves no one well, least of all the American people.

The simple truth is that the American people sentenced the Republican Party to at least two years of hard time in the House minority because they failed to pass a policy agenda that would directly improve the quality of life for everyone, especially middle-income working families and the working poor.

We cannot afford to repeat their political sins, or we too will find ourselves cast aside in 2020.

It seems, however, that those fears were unfounded...at least in the short term.

Instead, it seems that the House Democratic Majority has taken its job seriously; passing landmark legislation to reduce big money's influence in our politics, make it easier to vote and adopt common-sense gun reform.

In just a few months, Democrats in Congress have made a good start. But we have miles to go before we sleep.

Twice the new House voted to stand up for workers and end President Trump's reckless and destructive government shutdown and even found support across the aisle in the GOP-controlled Senate to block the president's illegal use of emergency powers to fund his top campaign promise.

Now, what does this all mean? I'm not sure.

It could mean that nothing has changed, that our Democratic leadership is simply exploiting a political opportunity and that this optimistic momentum will fade back into the political cynicism and blind obstructionism that characterized our Republican colleagues' recent tenure in the majority.

But it could mean something else.

It could mean that Democrats in the 116th Congress are ready to reject the old enmity and rivalry in order to answer the question that will define us as a party and a nation: How will history remember us?

It could mean that, though our opponents claim the contrary, we are interested in more than simply leading investigations and holding hearings. We are interested in more than shoving a metaphorical thumb in the eye of the GOP extremists controlling that party. We are interested in more than simply winning an election.

It could mean that we were actually listening when the voters spoke in November. It could mean that we're ready to lead.

I hope that's true.

I hope it's true because, if it is, then we have a foundation upon which we can effectively execute a block and tackle strategy that not only maintains our majority status and positions us to expand the political map in 2020 in order to take back the White House, but holds within itself the capacity to achieve the fundamental change for which many have been praying and working.

Now, let's be clear about something. I agree that we should investigate the cups of corruption that overflow in this administration. It's shameful, it's disgusting and it's harmful to our democracy.

Let us also remember that, in both form and focus, there is a fundamental difference between Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and Congress exercising its constitutional powers of investigation and oversight to seek out public corruption wherever it may hide.

But we should and are doing a whole lot more than that. We must now take it to the next level with a bold policy agenda for the American people. Let us expand health care, raise wages, reform K-12 and higher education, abolish student debt, invest in our infrastructure and make affordable housing a reality for every American.

We must take on and solve tough issues like comprehensive immigration reform. We must make the economy work for everyone. We must protect Medicare and Social Security. We must address environmental injustice, promote sustainability, restore fairness and rebuild trust in the idea that government can work for the people - all the people.

"Conor McGregor tweeted early Tuesday morning that he is retiring from ""Mixed Martial Arts."" - though it is unclear if he really means it.

""Hey guys quick announcement, I've decided to retire from the sport formally known as ""Mixed Martial Art"" today,"" McGregor wrote on Twitter at 1:18 a.m. ""I wish all my old colleagues well going forward in competition. I now join my former partners on this venture, already in retirement. Proper Pina Coladas on me fellas!""

The 30-yeard-old McGregor, one of three UFC fighters to hold championships in two separate weight classes at the same time, did not hint at retirement during an appearance on ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" on Monday night.

""We're in talks for July,"" McGregor said on the show. ""So we'll see what happens. A lot of politics going on. The fight game is a mad game. But again, like I said, and to my fans, I am in shape and I am ready.""

He had been in negations to face Donald Cerrone in July. Cerrnone will face Al Iaquinta on May 4th in Ottawa after a dispute over where a potential fight with McGregor would be positioned on the card, according to MMA Fighting. The Irishman, who is the biggest draw in UFC history, was captured in a video last week saying he would only fight as a co-main event if he received share in the company.

""I'm ready to fight,"" McGregor said in the video. ""I've said that, no problem. If the UFC wants me to slide into that co-main event and help, what that is, me sliding into the co-main event, it's boosting their brand over fighter rhetoric that they have. There's no problem with that. But if they want me to push that - and I have no problem pushing that - give me my rightful shares in the UFC company. That's all I ask. You can put me on the first fight of ESPN+, no problem. So let's see how it goes.""

He last fought in October at UFC 229, losing to Khabib Nurmagomedov by fourth-round submission in a lightweight title fight. McGregor made around $100 million for fighting Floyd Mayweather in 2017 and his Irish whiskey Proper Twelve has taken off.

McGregor tweeted in 2006 that we was ""retiring young"" after he was removed from the UFC 200 card.

While this could all be posturing, UFC President Dana White appears to believe McGregor is sincere this time.

""He has the money to retire and his whiskey is KILLIN it,"" White wrote in a text to ESPN's Brett Okamoto. ""It totally makes sense. If i was him i would retire too. He's retiring from fighting. Not from working. The Whiskey will keep him busy and I'm sure he has other things he's working on.""",73,New York Post,UFC star Conor McGregor says he's retiring from MMA
"Speaking to reporters regarding his conversation with the POTUS over the weekend, Graham said, ""Trump believes that it was the McCain people that spread this. He's right. There were some McCain people that took a piece of garbage and tried to go after Trump after the election. But I told the president it was not John McCain.""

Trump told Fox Business that McCain turned the document over for ""very evil purposes.""

""If you realize, about three days ago, it came out that his main person gave to the FBI the fake news dossier,"" Trump said on Friday. ""It was a fake, it was a fraud, it was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. They gave it to John McCain who gave it to the FBI for very evil purposes. That's not good.""

According to Graham, this is not the case. When the late Arizona senator showed Graham the document, he recalled telling McCain to ""turn it over to somebody whose job it is to find these things out."" He reiterated: ""John McCain did not give it to anybody in the press. He turned it over to the FBI, and that's exactly what he should have done. That's what you should do.""

Despite standing up for his friend's legacy, Graham is not trying to set himself up against Trump. ""I like President Trump,"" he said.

"Canadian elementary school student shows her dad her homework (Dmytro Zinkevych/Shutterstock)

In his conversation with Sir Roger Scruton, Jordan Peterson mentioned that in his native Ontario, elementary school teachers are teaching children a postmodern approach to literature. I thought that might be an exaggeration. No, it's not. Here's a link to the ""critical literacy"" explainer from the Ontario educational bureaucracy. Excerpt:

1. All texts are constructions. What is written is the product of many decisions and determining factors. Much of our view of reality is based on messages that have been constructed in this way, with the author's attitudes, interpretations and conclusions already built into the text.

2. All texts contain belief and value messages. Whether oral, print or visual media, texts contain messages which reflect the biases and opinions of their authors/creators; whether intentionally manipulative or not, this means that no text can be neutral or value free.

3. Each person interprets messages differently. Demographic factors such as age, culture, gender and socio-economic status as well as prior experience and knowledge play a role in how we interpret a message.

4. Texts serve different interests. Most media messages are created for profit or to persuade, but all texts are produced intentionally for a purpose. These interests can be commercial, ideological or political.

5. Each medium develops its own ""language"" in order to position readers/viewers in certain ways. Whether TV program, website or novel, each medium creates meaning differently and each has distinctive techniques, conventions and aesthetics.

It's not that any of this is ... wrong, exactly, but is imbuing kids with a hermeneutic of suspicion as their first exposure to literature really the best approach? Notice what is not included here: the idea that the work of literature might be a vector connecting the reader with Truth, Goodness, or Beauty.

Readers of this monograph will recognize how the expectations of the Ontario Language Curriculum capture the following practices of the four resources model:

1. Code breaking. Students need to be able to identify letters in the alphabet and sounds in words, decipher spelling and grammar conventions such as sentence structure and text organization, and use graphics and other visuals to break the ""code"" of text. Code breaking is equivalent to basic or functional literacy.

2. Making meaning. Rather than approaching text passively, students need to be encouraged to be a ""text participant"" - to use their own prior knowledge and experience when reading to interpret what the author is saying and to anticipate where he or she might be going next. They need to learn how to ""deconstruct"" text, to unmask an author's purpose and intent, to form interpretations in light of their own knowledge and point of view, and to examine and then find the most effective ways to convey their thinking.

3. Using text. Students need to be introduced to different text forms and how these have different uses which shape the language, structure and organization chosen by the author. Critical literacy teaches students to ask, ""What do I do with this text? What will other people do with it? How could it have been written or produced in a different way? It encourages students to become critical consumers of text who understand that meaning is tied not only to the author's purpose but also to the context in which a text is read and interpreted.

4. Analyzing text. Critical literacy teaches that no text is neutral, that students need to ask, ""What is this text trying to convince me of and why?""and ""Whose interests does it serve?"". Students need to be encouraged to analyze the author's motive/intent, to consider fairness, accuracy and reliability and to recognize their own power as readers. They need to be encouraged to evaluate what is said and how it is said in order to uncover and challenge assumptions and ideas about the world, to respond when they disagree and to take social action, even in small ways when they encounter texts that disadvantage certain groups. They need to understand that texts can be changed to recognize or include missing voices and alternative perspectives.

They're teaching kids to read books through a social justice lens. If a text is found by the reader to ""disadvantage certain groups,"" then Ontario teachers expect the reader ""to take social action"". Like what? Push for the book to be banned? What, exactly?

Longtime readers might recall the time I gave a speech on Dante, and a young woman in the audience, during Q&A, asked me in all sincerity why people today have anything to learn from a white European male who, as an inhabitant of late medieval Europe, believed many things that we reject today. I thought she was kidding. We have nothing to learn from Dante because he wasn't woke?! Really? After the talk, a literature professor told me that this is how so many young people are taught to approach literature. This bright young woman had been crippled by her professors, and had Dante, who is part of her cultural inheritance -- indeed, part of the world's cultural inheritance -- ruined for her by these educated barbarians. They maimed her mind.

When I discovered Dante, I found encoded in the Divine Comedy deep truths that set me free (I wrote about the journey of discovery and liberation here). I was fortunate in that I was naive, and didn't approach the text from any direction other than simply wanting to see what was in it. If I had come to believe as a result of my education that Dante was nothing but a malign example of literary whiteness, I would have missed out on the message in the bottle that turned out to be a map to show me the way out of the prison of my problems.

Take a look at another publication from Canada's education ministry, about critical literacy. Excerpt:

Critical literacy is an effective vehicle for teaching students how to analyze social issues and unequal power relationships. Critical literacy skills can help students identify, reflect on and analyze underlying power relationships which are seldom apparent and are rarely explored in texts or in the media. As McLaughlin and DeVoogd state, ""The teaching of literacy involves the selection and framing of values, ideologies, and contending versions of 'truth'."" They further define critical literacy as a way of thinking that challenges the inherent meaning of information and, by extension, life situations. Critical literacy is rooted in a rich history of approaching language and communication from a questioning and analytic standpoint.

Critical literacy goes beyond simply decoding and understanding texts; it emphasizes in-depth study in which messages and viewpoints are questioned and the power relationships - both in the text and between the author and readers - are considered. Deepening students' understanding of social justice through critical literacy equips them with knowledge that may help them to perceive and take action against injustice.

You will not be surprised that the author of this piece claims that critical literacy is necessary to build -- wait for it -- safer schools.

I see why Peterson is so angry about this stuff. For him, I gather, it's not about politics; it's about educating people for mental bondage.

I had not realized either how militantly P.C. the Ontario elementary school teacher's union is. They're heavily focused on ""social justice"" (see this program), and militantly left-wing about cultural matters. Some 81,000 elementary school teachers in Ontario belong to this union. It comes across as a political cult. Those poor children, indoctrinated from such a young age.

It really is the case that classical Christian schools are Benedict Option outposts. If you don't know what classical Christian education is, spend some time on the Circe Institute website. Here, for example, is a tight little essay by classical Christian teacher Joshua Gibbs, explaining that classical education is not about restoring a Golden Age. There are plenty other resources for classical Christian education online. I bring it up here to let you know that you do not have to despair. There is another way. There are classical Christian schools in Canada too!

"CANBERRA, Australia - Australia's prime minister has expressed concern over a media report that an influential minor party asked the U.S. gun lobby for donations to help undermine Australian gun laws.

"And everybody peddling it -- from House Democratic leaders, to Senate Democrats running for president, to the Senate Republican who reported the whole thing in the first place, to the roaring lions of the Great White Media -- knew it was a lie.

Sure, there are some -- take sleazy lawyer Michael Avenatti, for instance -- who are so monumentally stupid that he probably did not know that it was all a big con. It is not uncommon for newbies on Washington politics to fall for giant cons while somehow thinking they are doing the Lord's work. These people think very highly of themselves.

But for the most part, all the lizards around here selling this pile of horse manure about Russian hookers, backdoor deals and unprintable bedroom behavior knew it was a big fat lie. They told the lie anyway.

They have lied about Donald Trump from the moment he arrived on the political scene and taught them all how it is supposed to be done. As a political force, the candidate found gem after gem that these longtime experts had been ignoring their entire careers.

Truly, he gave voice to voiceless millions who for decades have only had these dishonest political eunuchs speaking for them. Now that he is in the White House, President Trump has carried on delivering on issues that regular Americans actually care about.

But the press ignores all of those issues. All they care about is the Russia collusion hoax.

That is partly because the so-called ""reporters"" in Washington are entirely cowed into submission by establishment politicians in both parties. They are crotch-licking yard dogs who just want to be allowed up on the porch.

Also, they were instrumental in the other Big Con on America -- the one about how it was inevitable that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. First in 2008. Then in 2016. (Spoiler alert: She never was the president and never will be.)

In the more than two years since President Trump made fools and liars of them all by winning the White House, the press has gone into overdrive to concoct their next fantasy prediction: Mr. Trump colluded with Russia and partied with hookers in a Moscow hotel.

Former Sen. John McCain passed the report on to the authorities. The press peddled the dirty dossier (funded by Democrats in actual collusion with sources in the Kremlin) for years.

The New York Times has run nearly 500 stories about it. The Washington Post has run hundreds more. The internet and television have been awash in thousands and thousands more speculative stories about a total mirage. According to the Politico ""news"" website, Mr. Trump has already been indicted.

What a freaking joke all of these people are. They could not get a job cleaning toilets anywhere else in America -- and I mean no disrespect to toilet cleaners.

My question is this: When are we going to see 500 corrections from all the breathless -- and hopelessly false -- reporting by The New York Times? Where are the hundreds of corrections from The Washington Post? And what about the days and weeks on end of running corrections on television?

The truth is that we will probably never see that. But we should demand it anyway.

Of course, what these idiots do not understand is that the rest of America moved on from this ""story"" a long, long time ago. They quit watching political ""news"" on television and tuned out all the ""Russia"" psychobabble.

They are more interested in the zooming economy and defending the border and ensuring national security.

Voters are always so much smarter than all the political experts in Washington. They instinctively knew it was all a big con job, an effort by the experts to deflect attention away from their own miserable ineptitude.

But it is worth stopping now and pondering just how stupid all the experts in Washington really think you are.",77,Breitbart,The Nuclear Option: Media Outlets Have Thousands of Stories to Correct | Breitbart
"""The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia ... to influence the 2016 US presidential campaign.""

So stated Attorney General William Barr in his Sunday letter to Congress summarizing the principal findings of the Mueller report.

On the charge of collusion with Russia, not guilty on all counts.

After two years of hearing from haters in politics and the media that President Donald Trump was ""Putin's poodle,"" an agent of the Kremlin, guilty of treason, an illegitimate president who would leave the White House in handcuffs and end his days in prison, we learn the truth.

It was all a bright, shining lie.

Reeling from Trump's exoneration, big media are now scurrying to their fallback position: Mueller did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice.

But Mueller was not obstructed. No one impeded his labors.

As for Trump's rages against his investigation, they were the natural reaction of an innocent man falsely accused and facing disgrace and ruin for a crime he did not commit, indeed, a crime that had never been committed.

The House Judiciary Committee may try to replicate what Mueller did, and re-investigate obstruction. Fine. This would confirm what this whole rotten business has at root always been about: a scheme by the deep state and allied media to bring down another president.

The Mueller investigation employed 19 lawyers and 40 FBI agents. It took two years. It issued 2,800 subpoenas. It executed 500 search warrants. It interviewed 500 witnesses. And it failed to indict a single member of Trump's campaign for collusion with Russia to influence the 2016 election.

Which raises this question:

If Mueller could find no collusion, after an exhaustive two-year search, what was the compelling evidence that caused James Comey's FBI and Barack Obama's Department of Justice to believe that such collusion had occurred and to launch this investigation?

Sunday, after Barr's summary of the Mueller report became public, Trump aired his justified anger: ""It's a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this. ... This was an illegal takedown that failed.""

Is there not truth in this?

Millions of Americans still believe what is now a manifest falsehood -- that their president collaborated with Putin in cheating Hillary Clinton out of the presidency. The legal bills of Trump, his family, his campaign aides and his White House staff must be huge. Careers, reputations have been damaged.

The nation has been distracted and bitterly divided over this since Trump's first days in office. He has had a cloud over his presidency since he gave his inaugural address. Any ability the president had to fulfill his campaign pledge and negotiate with the largest country on earth, Russia, a superpower rival, has had to be put off.

Is it unfair to ask: Who did this to us?

Who led the Justice Department into believing Trump conspired with the Russians? Why did it take two years to discover there was no collusion? Who gave Putin and the GRU this victory by helping to tear our own country apart?

Our establishment is forever demanding apologies. Where are the apologies for the outrageous accusations that Trump was guilty of something next to treason?

Sen. Joe McCarthy did not do a fraction of the damage to the reputations of Dean Acheson or George Marshall that the elite media have done, unjustly and maliciously, to the reputation of Donald Trump.

Years after French Artillery Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of colluding with the Germans in the late 19th century, and was sent to Devil's Island, evidence against another officer emerged.

Soon, it was Dreyfus' accusers who were in the dock of public opinion.

That needs to happen now. The instigators of this investigation, launched to bring down a president, have damaged and divided this nation, and they need to be exposed, as do their collaborators in the press.

The roots of Mueller's investigation go back to the Clinton campaign's hiring of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Trump. Fusion GPS hired ex-British spy Christopher Steele. He had sources in Russian intelligence who provided him with the contents of his infamous dossier. This was delivered to a grateful cabal at the FBI, which used it as the basis of a FISA court warrant to surveil the Trump campaign.

The dirt in the Steele dossier, much of it false, would be secretly shared with Trump-haters in the media to torpedo his candidacy; then, when Trump won, to destroy his presidency before it began.

Now that Trump has been exonerated, the story of how his accusers, using the power of the state, almost murdered a presidency with lies, propaganda and innuendo, needs to be brought out into the sunlight.

For democracy dies in darkness, and this can't happen again.",78,The American Conservative,Is It Unfair to Ask Who Did This to Us?
"After two years of looking forward to the moment the report of special counsel Robert Mueller would be released, the conclusion of his probe was a bitter disappointment for President Trump's partisan critics. Democrats' confidence that Mueller would make the bad dream of 2016 go away vanished the instant they learned he had found no evidence of the collusion with Russia they were sure would sink Trump.

They were just as unhappy that the letter from Attorney General William Barr closed the door to a prosecution of Trump for allegedly obstructing justice in the case.

But rather than accepting defeat and moving on to the business of attacking Trump on the issues, Democrats can't give up on the conspiracy theories they've been peddling since Hillary Clinton's defeat. Far too much effort and emotion has gone into the business of treating Trump as an illegitimate occupant of the White House to change tactics now.

The investigations being pursued by Democratic-controlled House committees offer friendly venues for further pursuits of Trump. But shorn of the incendiary Russia charge that some Democrats likened to treason, even those who vowed to impeach Trump understand that probing his inaugural committee or private business dealings falls flat as a ""resistance"" rallying point.

Yet if the thesis that Trump plotted with Moscow is now irrevocably debunked, how to continue to stoke their base's conviction about the president's illegitimacy?

Had they not spent the last two years lionizing Mueller, they might have been able to pivot quickly and assert that the report was itself a coverup. But that option was foreclosed by Trump's vitriolic attacks on Mueller that elevated him to the status of a national hero for those who despise the president.

That left liberal talking heads and pundits as well as Democratic members of Congress with only one available target: Attorney General William Barr.

Barr is coming under fire for essentially clearing the president on the charge of obstruction of justice even though his letter to Congress about the Mueller report conceded that Trump had not been completely exonerated by the probe. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler blasted that as a ""hasty, partisan interpretation of the facts.""

Some on the left are also claiming that the legal veteran, who also served as President George H.W. Bush's attorney general a generation ago, was tainted by a memo he wrote prior to his current appointment in which he said that Mueller ought not be allowed to pursue an obstruction charge against Trump.

That's now producing charges that Barr did a secret deal with Trump in which he obtained his office by promising to spike the Mueller probe and is bent on protecting the president regardless of the facts.

But if trying to depict Barr as a conspirator is the best shot Trump's critics have left, they might as well give up now.

The notion that Barr would be willing to destroy his good name after many years of public service or was acting out of ambition or partisanship to come out of retirement merely to help Trump evade justice is ludicrous.

Barr's willingness to spike any obstruction charge is rooted in some basic facts. Absent the crime of collusion, it's hard to argue that Trump obstructed anything.

All of the ""proof"" also comes in the form of public statements in which Trump was expressing resentment for being investigated on a charge for which he happened to be innocent, not some secret effort to derail Mueller who was allowed to drag out the investigation for two years.

Nor is it reasonable to allege that firing FBI Director James Comey obstructed the investigation, because it continued without him. The same is true about complaints that Trump answered written questions from Mueller rather than submitting to an interview.

Democrats need to understand that the American people aren't going to buy a campaign to demonize Barr as a proxy for Trump simply because they're unhappy about Mueller's paltry results. Doubling down on Russia now is bad politics as well as bad for the country.

Whether they like it or not, Democrats need to finally accept the legitimacy of the 2016 election before they can think about doing better in 2020.",79,New York Post,"In wake of Mueller report, the left will now target Attorney General"
"Many Hollywood stars made these accusations following Trump's press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Others accused Trump of treason for no apparent reason at all.

Yet, according to the Attorney General William Barr's letter to Congress Sunday, special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence whatsoever of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia during the 2016 election.

Here are 50 Hollywood stars who participated in the conspiracy smear campaign against the president.

""HE'S A TRAITOR; HE HAS SOLD HIMSELF, AND SOON HE WILL SELL US,"" Bette Midler panicked in July.

Rosie O'Donnell, like many in Hollywood, called Trump's summit a ""#TreasonSummit.""

""Arrest Trump when Air Force One lands. I want to see him in chains,"" filmmaker Michael Moore said.

Actor John Cusack declared Trump ""treasonous from day 1""

Barbra Streisand shared a New York Times article that called Trump a ""treasonous traitor.""

""Kim Jong-un, please come through those doors, join @realDonaldTrump & Putin on this #TreasonSummit stage and take this song & dance show over the top,"" Jeffrey Wright said.

""This moron, puppet, coward sided with Putin over our own intelligence agencies! On a world stage!! BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN PUTIN'S WORD! Why?? Can ANYONE answer that?? What the hell is happening. Politics aside, this is 100% un-American. Where are you GOP????"" actor Chris Evans said.

Late-night hosts went nuts, with CBS' Stephen Colbert calling the Helsinki meeting ""treasonous."" Jimmy Kimmel also piled on Trump at the time, and has since repeated the insinuation that Trump has committed treason. The View's Joy Behar also accused Trump of ""treason"" over the press conference with Putin.

In December, TBS late-night crank Samantha Bee also repeated the ""treason"" smear against the commander-in-chief.

Since 2017, HBO's Bill Maher has made similar accusations against Trump, which he repeated this year.

Rob Reiner also recently accused Trump of treason, saying in an unhinged social media post that the president is ""committing Treason against The United States of America.""

""He is aiding and abetting the enemy in The War against Isis and The Cyberwar against Russia. He has turned the world's oldest Democracy into a wholly owned subsidiary of Vladimir Putin. GOP, WAKE UP!""

In one of his deranged social media posts last month, Jim Carrey accused Trump of ""child imprisonment, money laundering, racism, misogyny, infidelity, environmental rape, and high treason.""

""TrumPutin 2020. We are no longer running against the GOP we are running against Russia and the GOP. 'Collusion is okay,'"" Mark Ruffalo said in 2017.

Prior to the 2016 election, actor Adam Scott was already smearing Trump.

""It's like a Nixon being mad about not having more pro Nixon sketches during Watergate. Our President committed treason and it's not going to be about sketches,"" Judd Apatow said last year.

Actress-turned-activist Debra Messing accused Trump of ""putting PRO-RUSSIA agenda BEFORE the United States best interests"" in September.

""Putin is giving trump talking points and actions to take to help undermine the very country he is from. We have a domestic enemy running our country pissing on about allies who shows fealty only to Putin. This is not America. This is Russia,"" Netflix host Chelsea Handler said last year.

Pop star Cher accused Trump of being ""a Liar,Thug, Crook,Traitor"" who's ""ruining"" America.

SNL faux-Trump Alec Baldwin accused Trump of ""treason"" over his plan to cut taxes.

Author Stephen King accused Trump of being ""in Putin's pocket"" because he congratulated his election victory.

Even minor stars got in on the action. Rapper Ice Cube called for Trump to be arrested, calling him ""Russian intelligence,"" while Sons of Anarchy star Ron Perlman simply predicted that Trump will soon be ""in chains"".

Check out all the Hollywood conspiracy mongering.",80,Breitbart,"Flashback: 50 Hollywood Stars Who Accused Trump of Treason, Collusion with Russia"
"It all began when, using the firm of Perkins Coie to hide the transaction, Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee hired a foreign national, Christopher Steele, who colluded with the Russians to manufacture a phony dossier that smeared then-candidate Donald Trump as a compromised tool of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, countless Dirty Cops in both the Justice Department and intelligence community used Hillary's discredited oppo-research to meddle in the election, to win it for Hillary, and to ensure there was an ""insurance policy"" should she lose. This meddling included strategic (and illegal) media leaks, outright spying on the Trump campaign, and wiretaps.

After Trump won, the Dirty Cops activated the insurance policy by plotting a slow-motion coup. Again, there were strategic and illegal media leaks and, finally, the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his gang of partisan lawyers, who would go on a two-year rampage that ruined countless lives in what ended up being a failed quest to overturn a presidential election.

The corporate media also played a crucial, conscious, and active role in this coup attempt.

To begin with, CNN's Jake Tapper colluded with the Deep State to legitimize the phony dossier/insurance policy as ""news"" by having disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey ""brief"" Trump on it. You see, the act of the briefing was the excuse the far-left Tapper needed to justify publicizing the existence of the phony dossier, and by extension, Trump being a Russian spy.

BuzzFeed's Ben Smith then used Tapper's report to justify publishing the phony dossier, and from there the entire establishment media was off and running with a two-year hoax fueled by a fire hose of fake news, invented sources, and countless ad hominem attacks against Trump and his family as traitors, attacks the media never challenged.

Now that it's all finally over, here's a list of the winners and losers:

We did our jobs. We kept our heads during the worst of the hysteria. We examined the evidence, held on to our healthy skepticism, stuck to the facts, and got the story exactly right. Our analysis, skepticism, insight, reporting, sources, and common sense delivered the truth.

From Breitbart News to the Washington Examiner's Byron York to Fox News's Sean Hannity and Catherine Herridge, to the Federalist's Mollie Hemingway to the Daily Caller's Chuck Ross to the Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel to National Review's Andrew McCarthy...

This is where sensible people looking for truth and sober analysis turned, and we all got it right.

Talk Radio:

Rush Limbaugh and many others in talk radio were one more oasis away from all the fake Russian news and hysteria.

Alan Dershowitz:

Famed attorney (and lifetime Democrat) sealed his legacy with clear, legal-based analysis which cost him many friends and career opportunities.

Jonathan Turley:

Another legal analyst who kept his head, dealt only in facts, and told the truth.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA):

Next to Trump, no one was scapegoated by the corrupt media with as much venom as Nunes, whose own committee has now been vindicated in its own finding of ""no Russia collusion."" On top of that, Nunes' fearless pursuit of the full truth around RussiaGate, the inconvenient truth about all the dirty tricks and Dirty Cops in the Justice Department and intelligence community, has been beyond vital to preserving the rule of law.

The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald is proof that political beliefs have nothing to do with integrity. There is nothing Greenwald and I agree on, but he is an honest man.

President Trump and His Family:

Forget the politics for a moment and try to imagine the personal hell Trump and his family suffered while being falsely accused of treason for two years -- of worrying about indictments and prison, of seeing the people you love repeatedly smeared in every corner of the establishment news media.

In the end, though, they stood strong and came out the other end fully exonerated. The president also deserves credit for keeping his eye on the ball. Thanks to his policies, America is enjoying the first era of peace and prosperity since September 11, 2001.

This list will single out the worst of the worst in the media, but the debunking of the Russia Collusion Hoax is the not the beginning of the end of the media's credibility ... it's the end.

Nevertheless, the media will not change the way they do business because to do so would be to admit they had done something wrong.

The good news, though, is that this broken and corrupt institution has undermined all the power it once had to sway public opinion. And so, all the media can do now is hang on to what's left of its audience -- the crazies who want to be hoaxed, who cannot face reality. Those loons are the media's customer base.

Lie to me James Clapper! Please, please, please lie to me. Tell baby what he wants to hear!

If this kangaroo court allows a bunch of Dirty Cops to hoodwink it into spying on a presidential campaign, imagine what's being done to everyday Americans.

Weekly Standard Employees:

Other than a few of their trolls, these staffers are all out work now because their useless bosses, Bill Kristol and Stephen Hayes, went the full-hoax.

Once one of America's most respected journalists, he has since lost his audience and all of his credibility as a stooge for the intelligence community. So blinded by his own virtue, Tapper probably believes being a Deep State cuck is patriotism.

For two years Maddow breathlessly -- night after night after night -- promised her audience Mueller had the goods. Most of her cult will probably stick with her, but she's exposed now and exposed cult leaders never last long.

Robert Mueller:

This dirty cop leading a gang of dirty cops spent two years digging a dry hole while destroying the lives of who know how many innocent people bled white by unnecessary legal fees. Shame on him forever.

This fake news network deliberately deceived its audience for two years with an all-in gamble that the Mueller Report would vindicate all those lies. CNN's ratings cannot get much worse than they already are, but who in their right mind would give these snake oil salesmen even a minute of their time?

No one will ever believe anything CNN reports again, and no one should.

CNN is now just infotainment for #Resistance stupes.

Jennifer Rubin:

Because she's so shrill, not only do we all know she's a joke, so does every dog within 60 miles of the Washington Post.

A den of Dirty Partisan Cops meddling in our elections.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper:

Because his legacy as a petty, grudge-holding, preening peacock who planned his funeral to satisfy his own smite was not already damaging enough, we now know he was peddling the phony Russia dossier to media outlets.

Every fake news ""bombshell"" these simpering quislings swallowed and spread with unbridled glee.

They told us Devin Nunes and Sean Hannity were wrong about everything conspiracy theorists like Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo said was true.

From Talking Points Memo to the HuffPost, there was not a moment of sanity, just paranoia and lies and red-baiting.

Intelligence Community

From WMD to Russian Collusion to partisan leaks and lies... More goddamned Dirty Cops who should never be believed again.

CNN's Drew Griffin

Griffin used to be seen as a pretty good investigative reporter. Now he will only be remembered as a bully who harasses old ladies based on conspiracy theories.

Hollywood Leftists

Every time Rob Reiner tweets a gay, black man registers as a Republican.

David Corn and Michael Isikoff

Mother Jones' David Corn Isikoff, the hack who sat on the Monica Lewisnky scandal until Matt Drudge forced his hand, wrote a whole book about how Trump colluded with Russia.

Millions voted under the false impression our president may have done something wrong. In other words, not only did the media and Deep State meddle in the 2016 presidential, they also meddled in the 2018 midterms.

The American People

We the people went to the polls in 2016 and chose Donald Trump to lead our country, which means that every injustice against our president, most especially at the hands of unelected Dirty Cops and their media minions, is an injustice against us and our God-given right to choose our own leaders.

For two years this hoax hamstrung his (our) agenda and weakened his (our) ability to do business overseas... This is unforgivable, un-American, and the wrongdoers must be held accountable.

This crime against Trump was also a crime against us, against America, and our Constitution...

"President Trump and White House officials react to Attorney General Will Barr's summary of the Mueller report findings; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is over and his findings conclude that the Trump campaign and Russia did not coordinate, conspire, or collude to help President Trump defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Furthermore, Special Counsel Mueller also declined to pursue obstruction of justice charges because the president was not involved in any underlying crime. In his letter to Congress, Attorney General William Barr stated that the Mueller report found no evidence that constituted ""obstructive conduct.""

In short, after 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants and 500 witness interviews, the special counsel came up with absolutely nothing. This investigation - which wasted tens of millions in taxpayer dollars - will be remembered for producing the biggest goose egg in American history. The President of the United States has been completely vindicated.

DEMOCRATS WILL SOUND 'COMPLETELY UNHINGED' TRYING TO CONVINCE VOTERS TRUMP OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE: KARL ROVE

Not only did Attorney General Barr's letter to Congress tell us what the Mueller team investigated, but by omission it also gave us clues as to what wasn't investigated. At this moment, it appears that Special Counsel Mueller did not consider the illegal activities and dirty politics that paved the way to his appointment in the first place.

The political weaponization of our justice system and intelligence community that occurred in 2016 and 2017 must not be swept under the rug. The American people deserve an honest and complete investigation - not for political payback as the liberal media is trying to frame it - but because the allegations are too serious to ignore. Tens of millions of Americans are expecting answers about the failed soft coup attempt against our duly elected president that just played out before our very eyes. It's a good sign that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is planning to do a thorough review of it all on Capitol Hill.

Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele - the former British spy who compiled the phony anti-Trump dossier for Fusion GPS - must finally be investigated. While we know that Fusion GPS was paid millions by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through a law firm, we still don't know who directed and allowed Simpson and Steele to peddle the fake dossier to President Obama's political hacks at the Justice Department, FBI, State Department, and intelligence community. Will Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ever get asked these all-important questions?

To paraphrase a famous Biden slip of the tongue, these allegations are ""a big f#ck*ng deal"" that must be pursued because the American people deserve to know the truth.

Fundamental questions must also be asked about why former National Security Adviser Susan Rice felt the need to plant exculpatory evidence in a highly peculiar email to herself on the last day of the Obama administration. On January 20, 2017, on her way out the door, Rice wrote that President Obama instructed law enforcement and the intelligence community looking into Russian collusion and the Steele dossier to do everything ""by the book."" The email was in reference to a January 5, 2017, meeting that included Rice, Obama, former FBI Director James Comey, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and Vice President Joe Biden.

More than two years later, knowing what we now know about just how politicized Obama-Biden law enforcement and intelligence leaders were behaving, the Rice email becomes that much more curious. Is it possible Rice wrote the email to make it look like Obama wanted everything done by the book, precisely because they were doing nothing by the book?

For example, James Comey's political move to trigger the appointment of the special counsel by leaking secret information to the press through an intermediary was not ""by the book."" Former CIA Director John Brennan's political stunt with Senator Harry Reid that caused Reid to publicly call for an FBI investigation into Trump-Russia collusion in August 2016 was not ""by the book."" Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe's infamous ""insurance policy"" meeting with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page was not ""by the book."" And former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's political efforts to publicize and legitimize the Steele dossier through media leaks were not ""by the book.""

To be certain, these examples of malfeasance are just the tip of the iceberg. Are we supposed to just forget about the rampant Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse and the ""unmasking"" of Trump campaign officials by senior members of the Obama administration? It goes without saying that if former Vice President Joe Biden decides to re-enter public life as a presidential candidate, he'll be the one forced to answer for all of this right out of the gate.

To paraphrase a famous Biden slip of the tongue, these allegations are ""a big f#ck*ng deal"" that must be pursued because the American people deserve to know the truth.

"People who want to demonstrate their innocence make displays of cooperation with investigators. They promise to tell them everything they know, and encourage their subordinates to do the same. Trump did the opposite. He refused to give the special counsel an interview. He used his pardon power to encourage his subordinates to withhold cooperation.

This is a good example of the rank illiberalism that this investigation has provoked in many people -- people who, in almost any other circumstance, would recoil in horror at such arguments.

""People who want to demonstrate their innocence make displays of cooperation with investigators""? Tell that to the Fifth Amendment. Tell that to the majority opinion in Carter v. Kentucky. Tell that to anybody who has been accused of something they haven't done, but who understands nevertheless that there are risks involved in taking part in any investigation. To put it mildly, law enforcement -- perhaps especially federal law enforcement -- has a bad habit of finding process crimes to prosecute when it cannot find any underlying transgression. And Trump is the president! In a whole host of different circumstances, it is smart for the accused to stay away.

Chait's first tweet promoting this piece read:

If you refuse to cooperate with the investigation, you can't claim you were cleared. That's how obstruction of justice works.

The second one read:

If an accused person wants to be considered innocent in the court of public opinion, they cooperate with the investigation. That's, uh, not what Trump did.

Perhaps in the interim, Chait read the text of the Fifth Amendment. But even his second, heavily-watered-down claim is illiberal. If we start encouraging the ""court of public opinion"" to regard as guilty those who remain silent or ""decline to cooperate with the investigation,"" we will not keep our legal protections for long.

"CONCORD, NH -- The findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report could make primary challenges to President Donald Trump even more difficult.

""There's no question it's a huge victory for the president and it undermines a core argument about Russian collusion,"" said a longtime GOP strategist who's a veteran of numerous White House campaigns.

ROBERT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION BY THE NUMBERS

""I do think it's going to make it more difficult to draw a contrast in a primary,"" said the operative, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

Mueller's nearly two-year-long investigation did not establish that members of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the election in favor of Trump and at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Mueller's long-awaited findings also did not take a clear position on whether Trump obstructed justice, with no conclusions that the president committed a crime but also not exonerating Trump.

Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Sunday concluded, though, that Mueller's report did not contain sufficient evidence to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice.

The news doesn't appear to do any favors for anyone mulling a primary challenge against a president who remains extremely popular among Republicans.

2020 DEMOCRATS DEMAND TO SEE THE 'WHOLE DAMN REPORT'

But former two-term Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld wasn't dissuaded.

Weld, who's moving closer to taking on Trump in next year's GOP primaries, said Barr's Sunday announcement is ""kind of neutral to my effort.""

Speaking with Fox News while campaigning Monday in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, Weld explained that he ""wasn't really counting on the president getting caught in the soup for having said 'I hope the Russians find more emails' during the heat of the campaign. That never grabbed me as an indictable or impeachable offense, frankly.""

Asked if the news makes his longshot bid even longer, Weld quickly answered ""no.""

And Weld - who set up a presidential exploratory committee in February - stressed that allegations of Russian collusion were ""only one of the many, many questions that's been raised about the President.""

WELD TAKES FIRST STEP TOWARDS PRIMARY CHALLENGING TRUMP

The former governor - who returned to the Republican Party after running as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 2016 - said he'll pull the trigger on deciding on a primary challenge in April.

""I doubt there would be anything to prevent me doing this,"" he added. ""I'm feeling more comfortable with this all the time.""

He also said he could raise the money needed to launch a primary challenge.

""I'm looking for old school money, my rolodex of years past,"" he said. ""I have reason to believe we will be adequately funded.""

A top adviser to former two-term Gov. John Kasich of Ohio also downplayed the significance of the findings.

""At the end of the day, I don't think this, a month from now, will have made much difference. And we haven't seen the Mueller report. We've only seen the Barr memo,"" John Weaver told Fox News. ""And as usual, the White House and Trump world have gotten way over their skis, because I suspect the narrative written by Bob Mueller is a little bit different than the narrative written by the Attorney General.""

Kasich, a longtime vocal critic of the president who finished second to Trump in the 2016 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary, is mulling a 2020 primary challenge.

Weaver suggested that Barr's Sunday announcement is ""not going to impact the governor's thinking one way or another because we weren't hinging our decision on any one thing like this.""

UPCOMING HOGAN TRIP TO NH STOKES PRIMARY CHALLENGE SPECULATION

The other possible primary challenger to Trump is two-term Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's heading to New Hampshire in April to speak at 'Politics and Eggs,' a must stop for White House hopefuls. Fox News reached out to a top Hogan political adviser but received no response.

A veteran New Hampshire-based GOP operative wasn't as optimistic as Weld or Weaver.

Michael Dennehy - who served as a top adviser on Sen. John McCain's 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns - said that the summary findings from the Mueller report and the announcement by Barr would make a primary challenge more difficult.

""Of those Republicans who are unhappy with the president, this removes arguably the biggest obstacle for the president in any potential primary campaign,"" Dennehy said.

Coli Reed agreed that ""trying to primary President Trump was always going to be an uphill climb.""

But the veteran GOP strategist added, ""I doubt the events of the weekend are going to move the needle much in either direction. Trump's numbers with Republicans have always been rock solid, even during some of the more tumultuous points of his presidency.""",84,Fox News,Mueller report could ward off would-be Trump primary challengers
"Apple on Monday unveiled a news subscription service that will give access to digital editions of 300 magazines as well as a curated list of stories from the Wall Street Journal and several other big newspapers including the LA Times and the Toronto Star.

The new Apple service, called Apple News +, will charge $9.99 a month to give consumers a Hulu-like experience to access all the online publications through their Macs, iPads, iPhones and other iOS devices.

WSJ will be the only national newspaper available on the new service, as the New York Times, the Washington Post and USA Today have not joined. Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and Wired, is participating, as is Hearst, publisher of Cosmopolitan, Esquire, and Harper's Bazaar.

""We already have been attracting new subscribers and readers at a strong clip, and now have the most in our history,"" WSJ executive editor Matt Murray said in a memo to staffers. ""Apple has the potential to push that further and farther, and at a much faster rate than we have experienced before.""

Jennifer Hicks has been tapped as editor of news partnerships to oversee the offering and the plan is to hire ""several dozen people in the coming weeks, including reporters in politics, US news and features, as well as editors,"" Murray said.

The rollout will give readers access to ""quality news on a trusted, ubiquitous platform,"" said Robert Thomson, CEO of WSJ publisher News Corp., which also publishes The Post.

""For too long, media companies around the world have been hobbled by dominant platforms' algorithmic ambiguity and their disregard for funding models that truly support quality journalism.""

Details on just what and how curated WSJ material will be made available via Apple News+ were not yet available.

For Apple, it is the successor of last year's buyout of Texture, which was an online subscription service financed by a consortium of big publishers but which only attracted several hundred thousand subscribers.

""We tried to do it with Texture, but it's a hard reach when you don't have someone like Apple behind it,"" said Art Slusark, a spokesman for Meredith which owns People, Better Homes & Gardens and In Style and other magazines. Digital subscriptions never went beyond 2 percent of its subscriber base, he said.

"Now that President Trump has been vindicated and the Fat Lady is singing, it's high time we hear from another matriarch- the Gray Lady.

She should say The New York Times apologizes for misleading America -- again. Back in 2016, three days after Trump turned the world upside down with his election victory, the publisher and the editor of the Times wrote to subscribers. Their remarkable letter was in large part an apology for failing to understand the Trump phenomenon and for missing the signs that he could win.

""After such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions,"" then publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and editor Dean Baquet wrote. ""Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?""

While they also defended themselves, saying the paper ""reported on both candidates fairly,"" they promised to ""rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism. That is to report America and the world honestly, without fear or favor.""

As I wrote then, ""Had the paper actually been fair to both candidates, it wouldn't need to rededicate itself to honest reporting. And it wouldn't have been totally blindsided by Trump's victory.""

And now, as Yogi Berra once said, ""it's deja vu all over again."" Because it didn't keep the promise to report ""without fear or favor,"" the paper is facing a new storm of criticism.

This time, of course, the topic is RussiaGate. And once again, the Times is accused of accepting and spreading fake news, and of missing the truth.

We don't need a trial. Guilty as charged.

The Times was way out front, along with the Washington Post, in peddling the Russia collusion hoax. And because of its prominence and the power of its news service, the vast bulk of the media followed the Times' lead. It is the bell cow, and it led the media over the cliff by getting the big story wrong.

And not just one or two or even three times, but for more than two years, the paper of record acted like a prosecutor making the case that Trump was at least compromised by Russia, and maybe even conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the election.

In doing so, it effectively swallowed hook, line and sinker the Big Lie that Hillary Clinton was selling -- that Trump was the illegitimate president. There was almost no difference in what she said and what the Times said about Trump and Putin.

Now that special counsel Robert Mueller, whose integrity the Times praised for two years, has declared Clinton's claims false, that truth now needs to be accepted by the hate Trump media. And nobody in the print media, with the possible of the Washington Post, hated Trump like the New York Times hated him.

Front page to last, news stories, columns and editorials. Coverage of culture, education, foreign governments -- most of it expresses views of someone who personally and politically detests the president of the United States. Tyrants in Asia and dictators in Latin America have it easy compared to the blistering coverage Trump gets.

In short, nothing has changed since 2016. And in both cases, the results were the same: The Times missed the story.

Just as reporters and editors believed Trump couldn't win in 2016 because they didn't want him to, they believed the Russia collusion story because they wanted it to be true.

The episodes are linked by a cause -- the collapse of standards at the paper. Executive editor Baquet, in the summer of 2016, decided that Trump was not fit to be president, a decision that opened the floodgates.

Day after day, page after page, so-called news stories started to read like editorials. Reporters were now free to give their opinion, and surprise, surprise -- they all expressed the party line.

Over and over, Trump bad, Clinton good. She was dubbed ""normal,"" he was called ""abnormal."" No bias there.

The Times' newsroom was a giant bubble and, like all bubbles, group think dominated. Nobody inside realized how unfair the coverage was because they all agreed with it.

Those who didn't -- and there must have been some -- were either intimidated or marginalized. The paper says it believes in diversity, but hating Trump seems to be a litmus test.

Naturally, there were many signs over the last two years that the paper had not changed its stripes. Despite its promise after missing Trump's rise, it almost instantly fell back into the same position of hostility once he became president.

The fixation on RussiaGate -- for which it shared a 2018 Pulitzer Prize with the Washington Post -- stands out, but it was far from the only example of biased coverage. Virtually everything Trump said and did sparked an avalanche of thunderous denunciation from reporters and opinion writers alike.

They didn't just disagree with something. They usually went straight to impugn his motive. Most times, scurrilous quotations were attributed to anonymous sources. Who can fight anonymous sources?

As for the economic boom, the Times, when it recognizes it at all, struggles to give Barack Obama the credit.

Lest there be any doubt about how reporters and editors feel about Trump, check out their social media posts where they remove even the fig leaves.

As I have noted, I take no pleasure in watching what was America's flagship newspaper decline into rancid partisanship. Journalistically, I grew up at the Times during an era when legendary editor Abe Rosenthal imposed a no-opinion rule on reporters' copy.

If you tried to sneak your opinion into a news story, it was removed, and objections were useless. If you didn't like it, the door was open.

These days, technology is disrupting and reshaping the media business and the Times has reinvented itself as a daily compendium of the war for social justice. Its pages are filled with identity politics, how unfair America is to illegal immigrants and breathless evidence that climate change will kill us any day now. It all fits into the paper's advertised ""mission.""

On Super Bowl Sunday, the big story in the sports section was the lingering pain and sadness of retired players with brain injuries.

So be it. But neither Trump nor technology can be blamed for Baquet's historic error in deciding that basic standards of fairness do not apply to covering this president.

Twice now, that decision has been proven to be sensationally wrong, and added to the growing distrust not only of the Times, but of the media in general.

By all means, it's time for the Gray Lady to once again say she is sorry for being wrong and missing the real story. But this time, she should do something about it.",86,New York Post,"The New York Times owes Trump, Americans a big, fat apology"
"A politics course at the University of Colorado Denver has intentionally removed all white authors from its syllabus.

According to a report from The College Fix, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver has intentionally removed texts by white authors from his class on American politics. The course, which is called ""American Political Thought,"" will specifically focus on texts by non-white authors.

In the syllabus, Professor Chad Shomura acknowledges that the course will focus on writings from non-traditional American figures. Specifically, he mentions focusing on ""marginalized voices"" and issues such as ""intersectionality.""

This course aims to develop an understanding of American political life from the margins. Rather than surveying traditional figures of American political thought, it attends to historically marginalized voices at the crossings of race, gender, sexuality, and nation. It explores issues such as intersectionality, antiblack racism and the American Dream, ordinary life, borderlands and migration, public feelings, mental health, and settler colonialism. The materials we examine also exceed the usual genres of American Political Thought. They include, among other things, poems, an ethnography, academic articles, a novel, and a hacked tarot card set.

The syllabus fails to mention any of the major figures in America's founding, including the Founding Fathers. When challenged by The College Fix on the lack of these voices in the syllabus given the title of the course, Shomura argued that he aims to encourage students to expand their perception of which thinkers are included in mainstream American thought. Shomura even admitted that past students have criticized the disconnect between the title of the course and the assigned texts.

""It's a criticism that has been expressed in a lot of my course evaluations,"" Shomura stated, ""but with each semester, I try to modify the course accordingly. This class might very well morph into something very different, whether within the next semester or in ten years.""

"Now that special counsel Robert S. Mueller's final report predictably found no collusion between Donald Trump or his 2016 campaign and Russia, it is time for the appropriate investigative authorities to probe the possibility of crimes committed in the perpetuation of the Russia collusion hoax.

Below, in no particular order, are eight key questions related to possible wrongdoing in the sordid Russia collusion affair.

1 - Was a false crime deliberately reported to the FBI?

Former British spy Christopher Steele reportedly met on July 5, 2016 with a Rome-based special agent, where he turned over the unsubstantiated, largely-discredited anti-Trump charges listed in his infamous dossier alleging collusion between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The controversial Fusion GPS firm hired Steele to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the dossier. Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm.

The dossier contents were so unverified that numerous major media outlets briefed on the document refused to publish stories on the salacious material.

The BBC reported that Steele's information served as a ""road map"" for the FBI's investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump's presidential campaign.

2 - Were Obama administration officials involved in passing dossier charges of questionable political origin to the FBI or bolstering Steele's credibility to the bureau?

David Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain, revealed in testimony that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was being taken seriously.

In a deposition on Dec. 13, 2017 that was recently posted online, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry's State Department, as well as an official from the National Security Council.

Nuland's specific role in the dossier episode has been the subject of some controversy for her.

In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, authors and reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier's claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates.

Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia.

Regarding the arrangements for Steele's initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report:

There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland's office at the State Department: Do you support this meeting? Nuland, having found Steele's reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light.

Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele's office near Victoria station. Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read. He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing. Then he remarked, ""I have to report this to headquarters.""

The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele's reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele's general work.

An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named another former official from Kerry's State Department for alleged involvement in circulating the dossier. The magazine reported that Kerry's chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, obtained the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually decided to share the questionable document with Kerry.

Finer received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland.

After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele.

Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an ""old friend."" Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal - which Winer in turn gave to Steele - originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals.

3 - Did James Comey withhold from the FISA court key information raising questions about the dossier, which was utilized as evidence in successful FISA applications to obtain successive warrants to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump's 2016 campaign?

Comey signed the first of three FISA applications in late October 2016. The second and third were renewal applications since a FISA warrant must be renewed every 90 days. All three applications reportedly cited the dossier.

Comey cited the Steele dossier in the applications to monitor Page even though his own FBI determined the document was ""only minimally corroborated.""

A House GOP memo on the matter relates that after dossier author Steele was terminated months earlier as an FBI source a ""source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated."" Still, Comey saw fit, according to the Republican and Democrat memos, to utilize the dossier in the FISA documents.

In recently released testimony, Bruce Ohr, a career Justice Department official, stated he informed the FBI that the infamous, largely discredited Steele dossier was based on ""hearsay"" and not tangible evidence.

Ohr said that he transmitted that information in the time period before the FBI under Comey used the controversial dossier as central evidence in the FISA application.

As Breitbart News reported, Ohr also testified that he informed the FBI at the same time that Steele's dossier was tied to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

Ohr testified that he further warned his FBI superiors that the dossier information was likely ""biased"" against Trump and that he thought Steele was ""desperate that Trump not be elected.""

Ohr revealed that he spoke to the FBI about the role of Fusion GPS in producing the dossier, and informed the agency that his wife, Nellie Ohr, worked at the time for Fusion GPS.

Comey's FISA application to conduct surveillance did not specifically state that the FBI had information that Steele was being paid in connection with any U.S. political party, according to House documents and the redacted FISA application itself.

The application also did not say that the FBI was provided with any information that would raise issues of bias concerning Steele. Instead, Comey's FISA application stated generally that ""the FBI speculates"" that Steele ""was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit"" Trump's campaign -- a far cry from informing the court that the dossier utilized as central evidence against Page in the FISA warrant was paid for by Trump's primary political opponents.

The phraseology that the FBI ""speculates"" on possible bias is at odds with Ohr's testimony that he directly told the FBI about several possible avenues of bias and that he had reason to believe Steele himself was biased.

In other words, Comey may have kept from the FISA court information that would at a minimum raise major questions about the dossier charges that were cited as key evidence against Page in the FISA applications.

The House Intelligence Committee memo documented that the dossier served as part of the basis for the warrant requests. ""Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,"" the memo states.

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a rebuttal of the House memo that confirms the key contention that the FBI and DOJ both failed to inform the FISA court that Steele's dossier was funded by Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the DNC via the Perkins Coie law firm.

The Democratic memo quotes a footnote from the FISA application, which says that Steele:

was approached by an identified U.S. person who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1's ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.) The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1's ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1's campaign.

That footnote, which does not inform the court of the dossier's ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign or Fusion GPS, was further confirmed when the Trump administration released a redacted version of the FISA applications last July.

Meanwhile, in confirming that he told the FBI about his wife's relationship with Fusion GPS prior to the first FISA application, Ohr also spotlights the House GOP Intel memo's assertion that Nellie Ohr's connection to Fusion GPS, which produced a central piece of evidence in the FISA application, was ""inexplicably concealed"" from the FISA court.

Comey's FISA application is also accused of incorrectly assessing that Steele did not provide information to Yahoo News. A Yahoo News article about an alleged trip by Page to Moscow was cited as purported evidence against Page in the FISA warrant, according to the House GOP memo.

However, the memo relates that the Page FISA application ""incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News.""

The GOP memo continued:

Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.

4 - Who leaked a classified briefing about the dossier contents to CNN?

On January 10, CNN was first to report the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to then President Obama and President-elect Trump. The classified briefings were presented by Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. Comey reportedly briefed Trump alone on the most salacious charges in the dossier.

CNN cited ""multiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefings"" - in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings - revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Prior to CNN's report leaking the Comey briefing to Trump, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.

All that changed when the dossier contents were presented to Obama and Trump during the classified briefings. In other words, Comey's briefings themselves and the subsequent leak to CNN about those briefings by ""multiple US officials with direct knowledge,"" seem to have given the news media the opening to report on the dossier's existence as well as allude to the document's unproven claims.

Following the CNN report, the full dossier document was published hours later by BuzzFeed.

5 - Why were Obama and Trump briefed on the dossier in the first place given that the questionable document was funded by Trump's primary political opponents and the FBI itself could not corroborate the wild material?

As per above, those two classified briefings were subsequently leaked to the news media and set in motion an avalanche of anti-Trump news media coverage on the dossier's wild allegations. The briefings also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document circulated within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize.

6 - What role, if any, did the Obama-era Justice Department play in perpetuating the politically tinged Russia collusion narrative?

Last year, the Justice Department inspector general (IG) referred former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to Washington's top federal prosecutor after an IG's report found that McCabe had lied to investigators or Comey four times, including on three occasions where McCabe was under oath.

McCabe also faced controversy over a much-debated text message from FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who helped lead the bureau's probe of Hillary Clinton's email server. According to the four-page Republican House Intelligence Committee memo authored by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the Strzok message reportedly referred to ""a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an 'insurance' policy against President Trump's election.""

There is also the case (cited above) of Bruce Ohr, a career Justice Department official, who admitted to interfacing repeatedly with dossier author Steele while Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS. Fusion, again, was paid by Clinton and the DNC to compile the Steele dossier.

Possible Justice Department bias was spotlighted by the Justice Department's Inspector General report on the Clinton email probe which described an extraordinary system of communication set up between former FBI official Lisa Page and former deputy director Andrew McCabe that bypassed the ordinary chain of command to communicate important information about the agency's probe of Clinton's email server.

The method of communication involved ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was romantically involved with Page, sending information on the Clinton probe to McCabe through Page, the report found.

Page and Strzok have been the subject of public controversy following revelations that they exchanged a series of anti-Trump text messages. Still more messages were revealed in the 500-plus page report Inspector General report, including messages in which the pair discussed stopping Trump from becoming president.

7 - Was the Clinton-funded dossier utilized in the Obama-era Intelligence Community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election? Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan gave contradictory testimony on the matter.

The January 6, 2017 U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) report released by Comey's FBI, Brennan's CIA and the NSA under Mike Rogers assessed that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. It also claimed that Russia worked to aid Trump's electoral victory.

In testimony before the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees, Comey stated that material from the Steele dossier was indeed utilized in the IC report. Internally, the FBI referred to the dossier as ""crown material.""

""So do you recall whether any quote, crown material or dossier material was included in the IC assessment?"" Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) asked Comey.

""Yes,"" Comey replied. ""I'm going to be careful here because I'm talking about a document that's still classified. The unclassified thing we talked about earlier today, the first paragraph you can see of exhibit A, is reflective of the fact that at least some of the material that Steele had collected was in the big thing called the intelligence community assessment in an annex called annex A.""

Annex A in the report was titled, ""Russia -- Kremlin's TV Seeks To Influence Politics, Fuel Discontent in US.""

The annex, like the rest of the report, contains the following disclaimer:

This report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment; its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.

Comey went on to describe a conversation that he said he had with Brennan about how to include the dossier material in the IC assessment:

Gowdy: Do you recall the specific conversation or back and forth with then-Director Brennan on whether or not the material should be included in the IC assessment?

Comey: Yes. I remember conversation -- let me think about it for a second. I remember there was conversation about what form its presentation should take in the overarching document; that is, should it be in an annex; should it be in the body; that the intelligence community broadly found its source credible and that it was corroborative of the central thesis of the intelligence community assessment, and the discussion was should we put it in the body or put it in an attachment.

I'm hesitating because I don't remember whether I had that conversation -- I had that conversation with John Brennan, but I remember that there was conversation about how it should be treated.

Comey's descriptions are at direct odds with a statement Brennan made during May 2017 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in which Brennan claimed the dossier was ""not in any way used as the basis for the intelligence community's assessment"" on alleged Russian interference. Brennan repeated that claim during numerous news media interviews.

Comey is not the only former top official involved in the IC report to say that the dossier played a role in the report's conclusions.

As RealClearPolitics.com documents, former NSA Director Rogers wrote in a classified letter that the dossier played a role in the IC's assessment and a dossier summary was included in an initial draft appendix:

In a March 5, 2018 letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, Adm. Rogers informed the committee that a two-page summary of the dossier -- described as ""the Christopher Steele information"" -- was ""added"" as an ""appendix to the ICA draft,"" and that consideration of that appendix was ""part of the overall ICA review/approval process.""

James Clapper, who served as director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, conceded during a CNN interview that the IC assessment was able to corroborate ""some of the substantive content of the dossier,"" implying that the dossier itself was a factor.

""I think with respect to the dossier itself, the key thing is it doesn't matter who paid for it,"" Clapper said. ""It's what the dossier said and the extent to which it was -- it's corroborated or not. We had some concerns about it from the standpoint of its sourcing which we couldn't corroborate.""

""But at the same time, some of the substantive content, not all of it, but some of the substantive content of the dossier, we were able to corroborate in our Intelligence Community assessment which from other sources in which we had very high confidence to it,"" he added.

It was Clapper's agency that released the Intelligence Community report.

The purported inclusion of the dossier may help to explain why Rogers' NSA assessed the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin favored Trump and worked to get him elected only with a classification of ""moderate confidence,"" while the FBI and CIA gave it a ""high confidence"" rating.

8 - Was the infamous Trump Tower meeting a political dirty trick against the Trump campaign?

Multiple Breitbart News investigations into the infamous brief meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016 between individuals tied to Russia, Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials point to the increasing likelihood of the confab being set up as a dirty trick against Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

Three Russian participants at the meeting have ties to the controversial Fusion GPS outfit, and two have confirmed ties to Clinton.

Also, email logs brought to light show numerous emails were exchanged between a Clinton associate, Fusion GPS and Trump Tower participants, with the subjects of some of those emails listing the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials and was by all accounts the very topic of the Trump Tower meeting.

One Russian participant in the Trump Tower presentation admits to personally knowing Hillary Clinton since the late 1990s and says he ""knew"" some of the people who worked on Clinton's 2016 campaign.

Another Russian attendee, a translator, testified that he was previously an interpreter for Hillary herself as well as for John Kerry and Barack Obama.

Questions are also raised by a timeline showing numerous personal meetings between Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and Trump Tower participants. A Clinton associate, Ed Lieberman, was listed as being present at one and possibly two of those meetings.

Separately, Lieberman met with one Russian participant the same day of the Trump Tower meeting, according to separate testimony.

There are also questions about the initial setup of the Trump Tower meeting, with the publicist who sent the infamous email to Donald Trump Jr. promising ""information that would incriminate"" Clinton later admitting that he used deliberately hyperbolic language to ensure that the meeting took place. No such incriminating information on Hillary was provided, according to all meeting participants. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Robert Goldstone, the publicist, further said that he believes the meeting was a ""bait and switch"" by a Russian lobbyist seeking a meeting on another matter by misleadingly claiming to be bringing the Trump campaign dirt on Clinton.

"""The country is not divided by racial conflict, but by conflict over racial ideology. ... Liberal whites -- not minorities -- are setting the tone on these issues,"" says the op-ed by Eric Kaufmann, a professor at the University of London and author of ""Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities.""

Kaufmann wrote:

Since 2012, white liberals have moved considerably left on questions related to race, reflecting both a campus- and online-driven cultural awakening that has accelerated in response to Mr. Trump. On the American National Election Study's scale measuring how respondents feel about a group -- white liberals are warmer toward minorities than their own racial group.

Yet Trump voters rate minorities relatively warmly. Racial ideology rather than race accounts for their differences with white Democrats: White Republicans reject [the progressives' claims about] affirmative action, the notion of white privilege and the idea that racial discrimination continues to hold minorities back.

Minorities again rank in between on many of these measures. When it comes to ""microaggression"" statements such as ""America is a colorblind society"" or ""You are so articulate,"" few blacks and Hispanics find these offensive while more liberal whites do.

In contrast, President Trump's MAGA coalition favors color-blind government support for all Americans. The popular support includes Trump's ""Hire American"" policy which is pressuring companies to raise wages for lower-income Americans -- including blacks and Latinos -- amid angry opposition from elite investors and CEOs.

So who are the white progressives who are pulling Democrat presidential candidates so far from the core of American society?

Kaufmann points to a 2018 study, titled ""Hidden Tribes: A Study of America's Polarized Landscape."" The white progressives are about eight percent of the electorate and ""younger, highly engaged, secular, cosmopolitan, angry.""

Almost 70 percent have been to college (versus almost 30 percent of the adult population), half are completely irreligious (versus almost 20 percent of the adult population), 80 percent are white (versus 69 percent of adults), and 28 percent are under 30 (versus 21 percent of the nation).

This college-educated, secular group of whites support big-government programs -- and government programs serve the self-interest of its clever and upwardly mobile members, many of whom are employed by the government or government-funded groups.

This group says a big active government is a moral duty: 86 percent say, ""People's outcomes are outside their control,"" so 95 percent say ""government should take more responsibility to ensure everyone is provided for.

The group wants the support of women voters: 91 percent of progressives say, ""Men start off with an advantage""; 91 percent say, ""Sexual harassment is commonplace nowadays""; and 96 percent say, ""Today's feminists fight for important issues.""

Progressives want support among minorities: 95 percent say, ""The police are often more violent towards African Americans than others.""

Progressives want votes from immigrants and businesses: 99 percent of progressives say, ""Immigration is good for America, helping sectors of our economy to be more successful and competitive,"" and 99 percent say, ""Undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and grown up here should be protected from deportation and given the chance to earn citizenship.""

President Barack Obama helped to create this progressive vanguard during his 2012 election when he created the DACA amnesty for illegal immigrants during the depths of the government-created 2008-2016 depression.

From 2012 to 2018, the percentage of white Democrats favoring more migration spiked from under 20 percent to more than 50 percent. The percentage of white liberals who blame racism for African Americans' relative poverty shot up from roughly 20 percent in 2012 to almost 50 percent in 2018.

This new focus on racial and ethnic circumstances has largely supplanted the left's former focus on income redistribution. This shift was spotlighted in 2015 when Ezra Klein, an editor at Vox.com, interviewed Sen. Bernie Sanders:

Another progressive at Vox.com, Dylan Matthews, explained his progressive horror at Sanders' pro-American answer:

I was disappointed, if not surprised, at the visceral horror with which Bernie Sanders reacted to the idea when interviewed by my colleague Ezra Klein. ""Open borders?"" he interjected. ""No, that's a Koch brothers proposal."" The idea, he argued, is a right-wing scheme meant to flood the US with cheap labor and depress wages for native-born workers. ""I think from a moral responsibility, we've got to work with the rest of the industrialized world to address the problems of international poverty,"" he conceded, ""but you don't do that by making people in this country even poorer.""

There are two problems with Sanders's view on this, one empirical and one moral. He's wrong about what the effects of an open-border policy would be on American workers, and he's wrong in treating Americans' lives as more valuable and worthy of concern than the lives of foreigners.

Progressives are also determined to display their solidarity against conservatives: 97 percent of progressives say that ""many people nowadays don't take discrimination against Muslims seriously enough""; 60 percent say, ""I'm not proud of my country's history""; 99 percent disapprove of Trump; and 99 percent say, ""Many white people today don't recognize the real advantages they have.""

This group has a huge influence in the Democrats' 2020 primaries -- and it is pulling the Democrat candidates into the progressive worldview. For example, on March 21, the Associated Press reported that Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand offered to provide taxpayer-funded lawyers to help illegal migrants stay in the United States once they ask for asylum:

Gillibrand says she's working on legislation that would guarantee asylum seekers a lawyer, create a system for Americans to foster immigrant children and break immigration judges out from under the U.S. Department of Justice so they can be independent.

These white progressives are often wealthy, and they downplay economic issues, such as taxes. In general, they do not want the government raising taxes on prosperous people like themselves or regulating business in ways that hurt progressives. The ""Hidden Tribes"" report hints at this pro-establishment economic angle as it describes a stereotypical progressive:

Keane is a late middle-aged attorney living in Indiana close to his family. His three most important roles in life are as a father (he has three boys), an attorney and a guitarist.

He describes himself as a liberal because he believes in the role of government in helping citizens. As a result of two divorces and changing jobs, he has had nancial problems, which he believes has given him more empathy towards others. Despite his struggles, as a white male he sees how racism persists in America and people like him have a clear advantage, while women and people of color do not. To him, America ""is not an egalitarian society by any means.""

He feels that America is ""pretty divided"" but finds it hard to get a feel for what most Americans are thinking, because crazy voices are ampli ed on the internet. He believes that compromise is important, but while we should compromise on issues such as taxes, there are some issues on which there should be no compromises such as slavery or racism.

The authors and funders of the ""Hidden Tribes"" study, however, ignored two huge political pillars of the progressive class.

The study did not address the progressives' core political strategy of divide-and-rule diversity. The strategy uses the goal of racial equality to justify mass immigration, an alliance with anti-progressive Islamic groups, and government suppression of mainstream practices and groups, such as the public's recognition that men and women are different and complementary.

The study did not look at progressives' alliance with business, usually via progressive offers of more diversity, government aid, and cooperation with investors. For example, progressives' support for more immigration helps investors by lowering wages and spiking the number of consumers -- even though immigration ensures many liberal graduates lose wages and careers to imported H-1B visa workers. Immigration also exacerbates environmental problems by importing more poverty, more consumers, and more polluters into the United States:

This progressives' alliance with business is possible because the Internet has enabled a ""diversity economy"" of mass variety, not just of mass consumption. This economic diversity creates many consumer niches and professional opportunities for college-trained experts. A 2010 article in the National Journal described this new political and economic alliance between CEOs and left-wing progressives:

[Immigration lawyer Jay] Marks's combination of professional skills, self-serving cultural pitch, and customer niche offer a prime example of a new wave of fast-growing enterprises that are having a profound impact on the country's economy, politics, and culture. These entrepreneurs don't use low prices to sell their services. Instead, they prosper by combining practical benefits within cultural themes that offer self-esteem and a sense of community to diverse slices of the consumer marketplace.

The amazing diversity of these enterprises' niche-marketing strategies distinguishes them from traditional companies -- General Motors and Wal-Mart, for example -- that succeeded by pitching low-cost, mass-produced goods or services to a mass market. These new outfits, and the diversity entrepreneurs that push them forward, have an outsized impact on the economy because their companies, such as Google and Whole Foods, inspire a different kind of demand for their products and the materials needed to make them. To make and sell its caramel macchiato drinks to customers, for example, Starbucks buys a lot of coffee beans from farmers, electricity from power companies, and time from employees.

This new wave has created a diversity economy atop the older economies of mass consumption, industry, and agriculture. In turn, the entrepreneurs' cultural preferences and political interests have reshaped the Democratic and Republican parties to the extent that the old political divides of Left and Right, conservative and liberal are becoming obsolete. In their place is a system that splits each political party, separates the traditionalists' one-best-way ideals from the new entrepreneurs' demand for diversity, and fosters the rival personality cults that emerged simultaneously around President Obama and former Alaska Gov.

In contrast, Trump's ""Hire American"" economic strategy is helping to raise wages and productivity for ordinary Americans. So it is under a simultaneous and coordinated attack by the establishment alliance of progressives and investors, lobbyists and staffers, establishment journalists and CEOs. That bipartisan pressure is bending Trump towards endorsing a claimed need for more and cheaper immigrant workers.

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller walks to his car after attending services at St. John's Episcopal Church, across from the White House, in Washington, on Sunday. (AP)

For two long years, Americans - Democrats (and Trump opponents) in particular - have waited breathlessly for Robert Mueller to be their knight in shining armor, swoop in with his Russia collusion report and finally be the hero to deliver what they so desperately desire: President Trump impeached.

When the report amounted to what essentially was a giant nothing burger, it was a major heart-check moment for those pinning their life hopes on this report. What happened this weekend revealed the sorry status of hearts all across America, which were revealed to treasure politics above all else -- a false idol that when worshipped will produce nothing but disappointment, anger, fear, sadness, and hopelessness.

The poster child response came from Bette Midler, who described a series of surprising symptoms after finding out the President of the United States indeed did not collude with the Russians. One would think, regardless of party affiliation, it would be viewed as a good thing that America's top politician hadn't corrupted the election process.

Instead, Midler -- whose tweet was liked tens of thousands of times -- perfectly demonstrated what happens when we place something other than God at the center of our hopes and dreams.

ROBERT MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BY THE NUMBERS

If you (as a Christian) are feeling depression, despair, confusion, sick at heart, and 'uncontrollable rage' after learning the President is not guilty of corruption, I strongly recommend repenting immediately because you are placing your hope and trust not in Jesus, but in politics.

Placing your hope and trust in politicians will produce exactly the kind of rotten fruit Midler is currently experiencing.

If you want to understand how millions of people were reduced to absurdity after Trump's election, crying in the streets and crippled by fear and anxiety, and you want to understand why we're seeing that today in the wake of the Mueller report -- you have to understand that everyone worships something. That's how God designed us - we were made to worship Him.

Those who don't follow Him still have the desire to worship embedded in their hearts. When they misdirect this worship, it leads to exactly the kind of folly we saw from Bette Midler this weekend. It reduces people to absurdity (crying in the streets after Trump's election in 2016, disappointed their President isn't corrupt today) because the god they worship is impotent, unable to deliver them, unable to provide peace and contentment no matter what situation they are facing.

It's interesting, people often point to the Israelites of the Old Testament and marvel at their folly as they continually revert to worshipping false idols and failing to place their trust in God. Even when He provided a pillar of fire by night and cloud by day for them to follow, dropped fresh food from the sky for them, parted an entire sea and swallowed up Pharoh and his army in a watery grave - they still grumbled and doubted and placed their hope elsewhere. They wanted to return to being slaves!

They were acting absurdly -- but it's easier to fall victim to than it seems. We are all guilty of idol worshipping at times - whenever we believe the lie that something else will bring us peace and joy and contentment. Whether it be porn, drugs, spouse, children, job, career, money, fame, looks, etc - let us use this example of misplaced worship as an opportunity to repent of the areas we are believing the lie, or choosing the fleeting passion over the lasting Savior, the worldly gain over the treasures in Heaven.

Our hearts are prone to wander. Pray for our own hearts, and for those who are lost and placing their God-given desire to worship in all the wrong places.",90,Fox News,Mueller 'nothing burger' report exposes folly of the secular left
"President Trump on Monday signed an order recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, abruptly shifting long-standing U.S. policy on the matter.

""We're celebrating the Golan Heights. It's something that I've been hearing about for many years,"" Trump said during remarks to reporters at the White House alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""This should have been done, I would say, numerous presidents ago, but for some reason they didn't do it, and I'm very honored to have done it.""

Israel has held the Golan for 52 years since capturing it from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. About 20,000 Israelis and 20,000 Syrians live in the territory, whose 1981 annexation by Israel was not recognized internationally. The disputed land remains a fraught issue in Middle East politics; Syria attacked Trump's decision as ""a blatant attack on its sovereignty"" and threatened to recapture the region ""through all available means.""

Trump's move is a political boon for Netanyahu, coming two weeks before hotly contested national elections on April 9. The prime minister, damaged by corruption charges and facing a stiff challenge from the centrist former IDF general Benny Gantz, has for months has called on the U.S. to recognize the territory as part of Israel.

""Your proclamation comes at a time when Golan is more important than ever for our security,"" the prime minister said. ""Israel won the Golan Heights in a just war of self-defense and the Jewish people's roots in the Golan go back thousands of years.""

Trump similarly recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017, calling it ""a long overdue step to advance the peace process.""",91,nationalreview.com,Trump Officially Recognizes Golan Heights as Israeli Territory | National Review

"How long did Mueller know there was no Trump-Russia collusion?

Former U.S. assistant attorney Andy McCarthy said Monday ""there was never a collusion case"" and that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was the result of ""political pressure"" that will probably continue.

""There was never a collusion case here,"" McCarthy said on ""America's Newsroom."" ""What I wonder is how long Mueller's known there was no collusion?""

McCarthy was asked by co-host Sandra Smith about Democrats calling for more investigations into the president after Sunday's release of a four page summary of Mueller's report by Attorney General Bill Barr.

The summary concluded that there was no collusion by the president.

Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Sunday that ""Congress must step in to get the truth.""

Many Democratic presidential candidates have spoken out asking for the full report, unsatisfied with the summary, including Sen. Bernie Sanders who asked to see the ""whole damn report.""

McCarthy believes the Mueller report results won't deter Democrats from continuing to investigate President Trump.

""If you think about it, it's all well and good to say 'great that Mueller came to the correct result in the end, what the law compelled.' But the fact is there was no rationale for having a special counsel in the first place here. There was never a factual basis for criminal investigation of the president articulated. There was no conflict of interest that would have prevented the Justice Department from investigating this in the normal force. Yet, because of political pressure we had this two year investigation.""

"There needs to be a lot of soul-searching among many leading members of the media, says Fox News senior judicial analyst Brit Hume.

Fox News Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume delivered a blistering rebuke to the mainstream media after Robert Mueller's Russia probe came to an end.

Hume slammed the media's hyping of the narrative that Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election - which has unraveled following the release of findings from Robert Mueller's investigation - on ""America's Newsroom"" Monday.

""It is the worst journalistic debacle of my lifetime and I've been in this business about 50 years,"" Hume said. ""I've never seen anything quite this bad last this long. It was a terrible thing. There needs to be a lot of soul-searching among many leading members of the media today and going forward.""

Hume said reporters, politicians and the public should ""welcome any effort to go back and find out exactly how this debacle was launched.

""When I say debacle,"" he continued, ""I'm talking about the political accusation of collusion which occupied our media and our politics for now two years... leading to this enormous investigation which has now cleared the president on this whole collusion narrative.

""We in this business, in our business, Sandra, need to look back and say 'how in the world did several major news organizations, networks, newspapers and so on, devote so much time to what turned out to be utterly baseless speculation' about the most serious crime you could imagine, mounting in some cases in the accusations we heard to treason.""

And for those who were pushing that collusion narrative, Hume suggests a little humility would help, although as of Monday afternoon, he isn't seeing much.

SOME META MUELLER QUESTIONS

Good grief.

After two years of frothy speculation over the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, we finally have some answers.

But here we go getting all frothed up again.

We haven't yet seen the report, which is currently being scrubbed and scoured by lawyers at the Justice Department who are redacting the bits that might harm national security, damage ongoing investigations or improperly malign innocents and bystanders.

But because of Mueller's topline finding that neither President Trump nor his campaign conspired with Russian operatives to defeat his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, we're watching an abrupt changing of lanes.

Democrats who had defended Mueller and his conduct are shifting into attack mode against a Justice Department some of them say is covering up Trump's misdeeds. Some Republicans, meanwhile, are renewing their own attacks on federal law enforcement. They're arguing that since Mueller has now cleared the president on the key concern, it's evidence of systemic corruption inside the department.

But we don't know what else is in the report and we don't yet know how much of it will be released. Depending on the decisions of Attorney General William Barr, we may be just at the beginning of a weeks-long fight over what Congress and the public will get to see.

But spin in the absence of evidence is worse than a waste. As we just observed after two years of Mueller time, insubstantial spin creates false, arbitrary expectations and often leads to rank embracement. But since grievance is the coin of our current political realm, there are plenty on both sides happy to ignore the giant object lesson dropped on their heads Sunday afternoon.

But there are lots of good questions to be asked today and in the days to come.

- Will this news help break the fever among Democrats or intensify it? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has for months been cautioning her fellow Democrats away from impeachment proceedings, instead urging them to instead focus on winning in 2020. We would guess that this reality check from Mueller will strengthen her hand in the long run.

- How does a post-Mueller Trump behave? The presence of Mueller's investigation was a powerful tool for the president's aides in finding ways to constrain the mercurial chief executive. While there will certainly be ongoing state and federal investigations into alleged ethical and legal breaches by the president, his administration and his family, a great weight has been lifted. How will Trump behave now that he is unbound by Mueller? Remember that voters consistently have shown dislike for chaos in Trump's White House.

- Which Democratic presidential candidates are best positioned to thrive in the new environment? The political ground is shifting rapidly, but we can't yet know in which direction. As we considered in our first question we can't say yet whether this will make Democratic voters dispirited or even more bloodthirsty. Certainly it will be a painful adjustment for the percentage of the Blue Team that felt assured that Trump would not serve out his first term. Will those and other Democratic voters demand a nominee who promises legal retribution for Trump? Will other Democrats try to forget the whole thing to focus on more traditional issues?

- Will this increase or decrease Republican unity? As long as Trump faced an existential threat from Mueller it was somewhat easier to paper over intra-party disputes. Just as Republicans could use the dangers of Mueller to try to keep Trump in line, the White House could use the threat of Mueller to help back down dissent. As we saw in recent weeks the Republican Senate has become increasingly restive. On the other hand, anyone who was withholding some loyalty to Trump out of a concern about collusion has no more excuse.

We are in the beginning hours of the next political era and know very little about the facts and decisions that will shape it. That sounds like a good time to consider the possibilities but a bad time for bold pronouncements.

Politicians and members of the press should act accordingly.

THE RULEBOOK: ABOUT BAD APPLES

""Because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the governing party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and consequently having little or no influence on the national government, the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be preserved."" - John Jay, Federalist No. 3

The experiment, titled Cheese in Surround Sound, started last fall with nine 22-pound wheels of Emmental cheese placed in nine separate wooden crates. The assorted fromage was played various types of sound waves and songs... There was also one control cheese wheel that wasn't given any music at all. The cheese was exposed to the music 24 hours a day over six months through a transmitter that focused the sound waves into the cheese wheels. ... Once the cheese matured, it was analyzed by professional food technologists, who concluded the cheese wheels exposed to music had a milder flavor compared to the control cheese. The group also determined the cheese that was played hip-hop had 'a discernibly stronger smell and stronger, fruitier taste than the other test samples,' according to a summary of the experiment's findings.""

He tops both Harris (39-41 percent) and Warren by 2 points (40-42 percent).

FROM THE BLEACHERS

""Responding to you call for comments [on] March 22: 'a lack of civics education in which too few Americans understand the value of their votes.' My wife and I have never failed to vote in an election where it was legal and possible. Lately I observe that the freedom of elections no longer exists in CA and some other states. In CA, a proposition has allowed only the two leading candidates to appear on the final election ballot. That, together with an open primary wherein cross party voting is permitted, resulted in no Republican candidate appearing on the ballot for US Senator this year. Hence, despising the Democrat party of today (previously being a 'liberal' Democrat years ago), I had NO VOTE in that election. Now there appears to be a 'trend' for malicious leaders of some states to force the presidential electors to vote in proportion to the national vote. Hence, citizens of those states will have no vote at all. Their vote is being stolen. If there ever will be a justification for armed rebellion in this country, this is it. Incredible. Disastrous. Criminal. Treasonous. All appropriate descriptions."" - Victor Galindo, Laguna Woods, Calif.

[Ed. note: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Galindo! It's a little early in the week to already be at ""armed rebellion."" You've got to give me time to get warmed up! I certainly understand the frustration of California Republicans who are watching Democrats press their partisan advantage by consigning the already weakened GOP to permanent majority status. You might talk to Democrats in some Southern states that have similar election laws as California. Louisiana's Blue Team would tell you that a jungle primary system is no fun for the weaker party. And while I certainly am concerned about what is now a collection of 13 states looking to hack the Constitution by awarding an Electoral College victory to the winner of the national popular vote, I would caution you against calling the elected leaders of those states ""malicious."" You may think that they are wrong, but I don't necessarily see malice in what they're doing. These folks believe in more direct democracy, a view that I assume is sincerely held and one which they believe would benefit the country. And most of all, I would urge you to be especially careful with accusations of treason against your fellow Americans. Using such serious words so readily not only ensures that no fruitful discussion can follow, it diminishes their value in those rare times where they might be needful. In politics and life, it is possible to assume the best of others while always being prepared for the worst. The practice of patriotic grace is a blessing to both its recipient and its giver.]

""I am embarrassed that this thought just dawned on me at the young age of 61... but is there any linkage to the name 'Republicans' to the US being a 'republic' and therefore supporting such concepts as the Electoral College and the Senate? Likewise, is the name of the 'Democratic' party directly linked to the strict concept of 'democracy' and therefore such things as majority rule?"" - Ted Toburen, Wake Forest, N.C.

[Ed. note: There are such linkages, indeed! The roots of our parties trace back all the way to the debate over independence and most definitely the construction of the Constitution. The first antecedents of the modern Republicans were the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton. They favored a strong federal government, a powerful executive branch, lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary and the indirect election of presidents and senators. On the other side were the Anti-Federalists who favored de-centralized power and stronger states. As the weak Articles of Confederation foundered, the Federalists, who were mostly northerners, had their moment. With the help of Virginian James Madison from the other side of the aisle, they gave us the basic republican structure of our government. The Anti-Federalists had suffered for lack of a leader to match Hamilton, but that matter was remedied when newly elected George Washington summoned Thomas Jefferson home from his diplomatic post in Paris. The struggle inside Washington's cabinet between Secretary of State Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Hamilton was the flash point for a new, sharper partisanship. Jefferson's emerging party took the name Democratic-Republican for itself, meaning to signal that they were for both the will of the people but in favor of republican institutions that would act as a check on tyranny. The Federalists soon fumbled. John Adams got bounced after one term and Hamilton was permanently disgraced because of hush money he paid to cover up an affair. Jefferson's victory in 1800 was the beginning of the end of the Federalist Party. By the 1820s, they were done. The successor party, the Whigs, that arose in the 1830s substantially carried forward the Federalist cause but soon enough collapsed on the issue of slavery. In the mid-1850s, abolitionists opposed to the expansion of slavery organized in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which repealed the 1820 compromise that forbade slavery in new states north of the southern border of Missouri. As momentum grew for the anti-slavery cause, the members of this group took the name Republican for themselves. By this point, the Democrats had long ago dropped the R-word from their name. With Andrew Jackson and his successors, the party's passions were clearly with the will of the people over the republican restraint. The new party that would be defined by Abraham Lincoln, however, wanted to put the rule of law and federal authority first. There are many, many exceptions, but generally we can say that Democrats have traditionally placed the greatest value on the will of the people while Republicans have been more interested in the rights of individual persons.]

"California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna says impeachment is a very high bar, lots of evidence is needed.

There has been a lot of talk about exoneration since the release of Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report and I can't help but feel that it's missing the point.

The only person Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller probe exonerated is Nancy Pelosi. And it's time that all Democrats wake up to that reality.

Over the past ten days or so there has been an intraparty dispute over whether Democrats should be pushing the issue of impeachment. Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was on the Sunday show circuit bobbing and weaving while Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and others were more direct: Trump has committed impeachable offenses. Not only that, we should be focusing on them.

MUELLER DID NOT EXONERATE TRUMP - BARR ACTED AS JUDGE AND JURY. NOW CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO ITS JOB

Then comes Speaker Pelosi, flexing her experience and impeccable judgment just as she did during the border wall/government shutdown hysteria with wise advice for Democrats: focus on the issues and wait until we get all the facts to talk about removing Trump from office.

This is a proven strategy for success. There were barely any Democrats running on a Russia conspiracy/impeachment platform in the 2018 midterms. The line that ""Democrats are running on collusion"" is a favored talking point of the right, based in as much in reality as the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophile sex ring out of a D.C. area pizza joint.

Democrats ran on the promoting a positive agenda centered on the promise to protect ObamaCare - which now enjoys over 50 percent approval - and delivering smart fixes that will make sure health care is affordable and high quality. The proof is in the victory pudding with over 40 percent of Americans reporting that health care was the most important issue to them and overwhelmingly breaking for Democrats.

We picked up 40 Congressional seats (with North Carolina's 9th district set for a new election after a GOP congressman cheated) and seven governors' mansions. Not to mention taking back state legislatures all over the nation.

America welcomed Democrats back into power after a dismal electoral performance the last decade wherein we lost over 1,000 seats.

Just days after the 9th anniversary of former President Barack Obama's signing of the Affordable Care Act, an achievement largely due to Pelosi's ability to bring her caucus together, we need a much more honest reckoning of what she is offering Democrats.

Pelosi consistently shields them from uncomfortable positions like having to back her for speaker on the campaign trail. Bash her if you need to, Democrats were told. And more recently, the move to poo-poo impeachment talk without A) a smoking gun and B) a majority in the Senate gives Democrats a better chance at getting to talk about the issues that animate their campaigns and agendas.

Just look at the candidates running for president. Do you think Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren or South Bend's Mayor Pete wants to waste breathe on this? They've got an agenda to address economic inequality, advance the health care debate and criminal justice reform to roll out.

Or how about any of the new moderate Democrats that were elected in districts that went for Trump in 2016? There are a whole hell of a lot of Americans who couldn't care less about the Russia probe and they chose us, Democrats, to represent them in Congress.

"The party often choose candidates who were previously obscure

With Joe Biden set to declare his candidacy for president, the race for the Democratic nomination is about to be fully engaged.

According to the polls right now, it looks like a two-man race between Biden and Bernie Sanders, but do not pay too much attention to the polls, at least not yet. The history of Democratic politics suggests that we could be in for some surprises. I think it is going to be a wild ride.

Democrats have a history of selecting candidates who were not very well known at the start of the primary. That is in stark contrast to the GOP, which usually picks somebody that voters already know. If you go back to the first cycle in which the Democrats really allowed their voters to pick, you see that pattern: George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992, Barack Obama in 2008. This is not an iron-clad guarantee, mind you. Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016 were all definitely the front-runners at the start of their races, and they won in the end. But the Democrats do like to pick candidates who were previously unknown.

That means, in turn, that a lot depends on who catches fire or who flames out. Voters do not know a lot about these candidates, so as they learn more about them, the polls can undergo huge shifts. For instance, Hillary Clinton had a pretty comfortable lead in South Carolina at the end of 2007. But then Obama began to catch fire in Iowa, and Democrats around the country started to notice him, and he won the South Carolina primary handily. Something similar happened with John Kerry during the 2004 cycle. He had gone heavily into New Hampshire in 2003, but had little to show for it, as Howard Dean was dominating the early polls. So Kerry shifted his resources to Iowa in a last-ditch effort to save his campaign, and it worked. He caught fire there, and Dean famously flamed out. Kerry dominated the primaries from that point onward.

The Democrats are also a notoriously factional political party, with a lot of different constituencies that have their own preferences. That sometimes leads to strange results, as factions can reinforce or neutralize one another. For instance, in 1976, Carter was the candidate of liberals in the South, who did not wish to back George Wallace. But he was also the candidate of moderates in the North, who thought that Mo Udall was too left-wing. A year before, nobody could have predicted that would happen. Another surprising event, from 1988: Dukakis won the nomination in large measure because Al Gore and Jesse Jackson split the southern vote, with Gore winning southern whites and Jackson winning southern blacks. Four years later, the South lined up solidly behind Bill Clinton, which delivered him a string of victories right before the primaries in Illinois and Michigan.

Another point to bear in mind is the allocation of delegates in the Democratic primary. It is almost entirely proportional. Republican states usually give bonuses to the candidate who wins the most votes, even if it is a plurality victory. Sometimes, those bonuses can be enormous. This is how Donald Trump was able to win more than 60 percent of the GOP delegates in 2016 while only winning about 45 percent of the vote. The Democrats do not do that. Their delegate totals are going to track their vote totals pretty closely. This, too, can create surprises, because it stretches out the length of the contest, as front-running candidates sometimes struggle to build an unbeatable delegate lead.

For instance, in 1980, Ted Kennedy challenged Carter for the Democratic nomination, but it did not go well at first. Carter's job-approval rating surged in reaction to the Iran hostage crisis, while Kennedy seemed unsure of himself in an infamous interview with Roger Mudd. Though Carter dominated the early contests, including a better than two-to-one victory in Illinois, he did not accumulate enough delegates to put away Kennedy, who finally won a significant victory in New York. From that point forward, it was a dog fight all the way to the convention. Carter won enough delegates to secure the nomination, but Kennedy thought he could hang in because of the allocation rules of the Democratic system. And if Carter had stumbled, Kennedy might very well have surged to victory. Something similar happened in 2016. Hillary Clinton built a solid delegate lead, but the rules of the Democratic nomination never gave her enough to force Sanders out. If she had made some critical mistake, he could have won the nomination.

All of these patterns might be on display in 2020. Or maybe just some of them. Or maybe none of them! We cannot possibly know. And with about a dozen serious Democrats vying for the nomination, it is impossible to know who would benefit from which series of events.

All in all, history strongly suggests that we could be surprised by what the Democrats end up doing. Somebody that no one is thinking about right now could win the nomination, owing to a series of circumstances that nobody could possibly predict.",97,nationalreview.com,Democratic Party Presidential Nomination: Surprises Ahead
"'The Next Revolution' talks with Ari Fleischer, Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter, and Kayleigh McEnany to break down everything you need to know about the Mueller report.

Politics abhors a vacuum and Attorney General Bill Barr filled it Sunday when he tried to exonerate Donald Trump using the ""Mueller report"" as a fig leaf. Barr acted as judge and jury in a three page letter deeming Trump's innocence without any evidence, explanation, or even the Mueller report itself

First, let me start with a fact. We have not seen the Mueller report. Let me repeat that...We have not seen the Mueller report. Not one page. Not one paragraph. Not one period. Nothing. So, we have no idea what is in it, what Mueller did, what Mueller said, and what, if anything, Barr used from it to make his decisions.

Speaking of decisions, if Barr is to be believed - and that's a big if - then Mueller wrote a report that didn't make one decision regarding any crimes he examined. Is this possible? It is hard to believe and highly unusual, if true.

REP. AL GREEN AFTER MUELLER FINDINGS RELEASED: 'IMPEACHMENT IS NOT DEAD'

The only reason Mueller would take this approach is to adhere to the Department of Justice policy, not a law, that a sitting president cannot be indicted. If that's the case then it is possible Mueller wrote a report that laid out evidence about his examination of the Russian interference into the 2016 election and Trump's role in it, which was his charge, and the evidence that he uncovered was provided as a road map for Congress to review these matters and take action.

High crimes and misdemeanor versus a legal standard that, even if it was met, couldn't be used to indict a president. That was the choice in that situation. It is the only explanation for Mueller's actions if indeed that is what he did. If so, despite his intentions, then Mueller's decision to play by the rules, even the 21st-century version of them, with people who don't believe in rules, like Trump and Barr, was a miscalculation of epic proportions. Mueller likely thought Congress would get the report and act on it. That is not what happened Sunday. Instead, Barr used the opportunity to give Trump a temporary public relations advantage that isn't based on the Mueller report.

Given the long-standing concerns about Trump and Russia, many of them in plain sight, it is even more puzzling that Mueller didn't find some evidence of conspiracy or obstruction as Barr claims.

Most Americans saw Trump appeal to Russia to find Clinton's 30,000 missing emails during the campaign, on national TV no less, and then, lo and behold, they watched as WikiLeaks released troves of emails.

Most Americans saw Trump repeatedly deny having any business interest in Russia during the campaign, yet he signed a letter of intent for a Trump Tower Moscow during the primary campaign in 2015.

Most Americans saw Trump fire Comey, who was leading an investigation into him, and admit in a national interview that he did so because of the ""Russia thing."" Trump then bragged to Russian officials, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavarov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in the Oval Office that his Russia problems were over now because he fired Comey...and shared highly classified information with them too.

Barr's actions to try to exonerate Trump in this manner, without facts or evidence, is a disservice to our country, our democracy, and the American people.

Most Americans have seen all the meetings between Trump and Putin, official and unofficial, defending Russia but not the United States. In almost every economic and foreign policy matter that involves Russia, Trump takes Putin's side, as in his desire to end NATO. Now, why would he do that?

The only way to answer these questions, and more, is to make the Mueller report public. All of it. All the evidence. Every document, every interview, every transcript, every tape, everything should be provided.

That shouldn't be a problem. After all, Donald Trump said he wanted the Mueller report to be made public. At CPAC, Donald Trump, Jr., stated that he wanted all of the Mueller report to be public, without redactions.

Most Republicans want the report to be public too. Representative Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has been adamant about it. So too has Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., former chair of the House Intelligence Committee. After all, we might finally find out why Nunes went running to the White House in the middle of the night after reviewing some surveillance files about the matter. Surely Nunes still wants the Mueller report to be made public.

In fact, Congress voted 420-0 to make the Mueller report public. Naming a post office doesn't get a vote like that one.

Most importantly, 92 percent of the American people want the Mueller report to be made public. With that kind of bipartisan support, the Mueller report should be made public this week.

After all, Barr somehow went through the work of 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 interviews, 500 search warrants, 230 orders for communication records, 50 orders authorizing the use of pen registers, and 13 requests to foreign governments, in only two days - what took Mueller two years to produce - to make his decision to exonerate Trump on Sunday. In that light, surely Barr could make the Mueller report public Monday.

With the Mueller report submitted, we are not in the court of law, for the moment, but the court of public opinion. And that is clearly why Barr decided to play politics Sunday. It was the only way he could try to exonerate Trump without the actual report.

Given the reason for the Mueller investigation, the public deserves to know exactly what Russia did to interfere in our election, what Trump knows about it, what Trump did about it, and how Trump benefitted from it.

Barr didn't answer any of those questions Sunday, and we don't know if the Mueller report answered them, either. That's why the public must demand the Mueller report be released. Congress must demand it. The media must demand it.

"'The Next Revolution' talks with Ari Fleischer, Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter, and Kayleigh McEnany to break down everything you need to know about the Mueller report.

For the second time in 48 hours, Attorney General William Barr demonstrated he is determined to go by the law, not bend to the winds of politics. This is exactly what the nation's top law enforcement officer should do.

Barr's letter to members of Congress Sunday summarizing the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller - clearing President Trump, his campaign and associates of allegations that they colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election - follows perfectly the letter of the governing regulations under which Mueller was appointed.

Not only has President Trump been vindicated on the bogus charge of collusion with Russia. The rule of law in our constitutional democracy has once more been vindicated. This is an enormous achievement.

READ THE MUELLER REPORT FINDINGS: BARR'S LETTER TO CONGRESS

All Americans should welcome the fact that Barr's summary of the Mueller report said the special counsel found that President Trump's repeated claims of ""no collusion"" with Russia were accurate. An alternate finding would leave the president under a continuing cloud, diverting his attention and the nation's from the important business of government.

Mueller found lots of Russian skullduggery in our 2016 presidential election, to be sure, including ""multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."" The Russians went fishing - but the Trump campaign did not bite.

Mueller found lots of Russian skullduggery in our 2016 presidential election, to be sure, including ""multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."" The Russians went fishing - but the Trump campaign did not bite.

The bad news for the president is that Mueller did not give him a clean bill of health on a second issue - obstruction of justice. Far from it. To the contrary, the special counsel's report, which remains confidential at this time, addresses ""a number of actions by the President - most of which have been the subject of public reporting"" - that ""potentially raise obstruction-of-justice concerns,"" Barr wrote.

Remarkably, at the end of the day, Mueller punted on the important question of whether President Trump has obstructed justice. This is telling: Mueller ""ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment,"" Barr wrote in his letter.

The Mueller report is thus Hamlet-like. It ""sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved whether the president's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction,"" Barr wrote.

This is one of those classic ""thanks a whole lot"" moments. Mueller was hired to do a job, but he chose in the end not to do it. He would not pull the prosecutorial trigger - quite apart from the issue of whether a sitting president can be indicted.

Mueller's decision not to make a determination on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump suggests the likelihood of a division of opinion within the special counsel's ranks. The result of that ""house divided"" is that Mueller washed his hands of the issue.

The nettlesome question of coming to a legal conclusion about possible obstruction of justice by the president was left to both Attorney General Barr and, tellingly, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Mueller reported to Rosenstein for virtually all of his long tenure.

Rosenstein and Barr took up the mantle of deciding whether President Trump obstructed justice and came to a prosecutorial conclusion: ""The evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,"" Barr wrote.

This is huge.

Barr and Rosenstein came to a final judgment on obstruction - no crime committed by the president - whereas Mueller concluded only that ""difficult issues"" of law and fact were raised by the president's conduct.

Indeed, to leave no doubt whatever as to his wringing-of-hands indecision, Mueller wrote, according to Barr: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

Decoded: The special counsel has intentionally tossed the entire matter over to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which has already been sharpening its knives.

Demands for full disclosure of the Mueller report will now reach a fever pitch, with Barr receiving threatening demands for complete transparency - law and tradition be damned.

For his part, Barr will do exactly what the law requires. He's the attorney general, not a staff counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.

In consultation with Mueller, Barr will promptly review the full Mueller report to identify and presumably redact legally protected information under the governing Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Barr will then share what he can, under law, with Congress. And Congress will then work its will.

"Today, Attorney General William Barr released his summary of the ""principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation."" The document is light on details, but it contains a key quote from the special counsel's report itself. Here it is, in full: ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" This is unambiguously good news. If you doubt this, consider the alternative. Just imagine the bomb that would detonate in the American body politic if we discovered through this investigation that a sitting president worked with a hostile government (arguably our chief geopolitical foe) to try to tip the balance in a close election.

Instead, Americans should feel even greater confidence in the legitimacy of the 2016 election. They should reject -- once and for all -- the lurid conspiracy theories that have dominated parts of the Internet and gained entirely too much purchase in the broader media. And critically, they should trust Mueller's conclusion. Remember how Trump's defenders repeatedly and loudly noted that Mueller staffed his team with Democratic lawyers? Well, this is their report. Earlier today, MSNBC's Joy Reid said that ""it feels like the seeds of a cover-up are here."" This is irresponsible rhetoric. There is no evidence of a cover-up. Instead, there's a great deal of evidence that Mueller conducted a thorough and diligent investigation.

So, what's next? I agree with my colleague Andrew McCarthy. The American people need full disclosure -- and not just of the Mueller report itself. We need to see relevant FISA applications, supporting documents, classified testimony, and any other evidence relevant to not just the Mueller investigation itself but also to the inception of the Trump-Russia investigation. This conclusion is rendered even more urgent by two important political realities.

The first relates to the obstruction of justice. As Barr explains in his letter, the Mueller report neither accuses Trump of committing obstruction of justice in the course of the investigation, nor does it exonerate him. Instead, the attorney general and deputy attorney general (both Trump appointees) examined the evidence and concluded that the evidence was ""not sufficient"" to conclude that the president obstructed justice. Democrats will trust this conclusion exactly as much as Republicans would trust a Democratic attorney general to evaluate the actions of a Democratic president.

The second important political reality relates to a common Republican theory of the Trump-Russia investigation -- that it was conceived and pursued in bad faith, for wholly partisan political reasons. Under this theory, the entire Trump-Russia controversy truly began with an act of Democratic collusion -- the Clinton campaign's commissioning of Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research that became the infamous ""Steele dossier."" In other words, there certainly was ""worse-than-Watergate"" corruption in 2016, but it was Democratic corruption.

Based on the publicly available evidence, I agree with Trey Gowdy. There would have been an investigation without the dossier. As he said, it had ""nothing to do with [Donald Trump Jr.'s] meeting at Trump Tower."" It had ""nothing to do with George Papadopoulos' meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice."" But that doesn't mean the creation and use of the dossier was proper, or that the worst Republican allegations shouldn't be examined and evaluated once and for all.

Finally, nothing in Barr's letter excuses the fact that Trump hired and surrounded himself with some of the worst people in politics -- felons and liars who sometimes committed crimes in the ham-handed attempt to cover up their own contacts or attempted contacts with Russian assets or operatives. The president's personal lawyer, his campaign chair, his longtime friend and adviser, and his first national-security adviser (among others) each engaged in patterns of deception that were not only criminal, they created real and genuine alarm in fair-minded Americans that at least some people in the president's inner circle were more than willing to work with our enemies abroad to gain financial or political advantage here at home.

But these facts notwithstanding, there are still grounds for immense relief that America's most recent presidential election has been (further) legitimized and that years of speculation about President Trump's ties to the Russian government have proven unfounded. These last 30 months of investigations -- beginning well before Mueller's appointment -- are among the most divisive and contentious events in modern political history. As we wait to read the full report and move into the inevitable battles over its contents, we can be sure that more division and contention await. Yet today, at least, we can be grateful for the good news we have, and it is good news indeed.",100,nationalreview.com,Barr's Letter Contains Unambiguously Good News for the U.S. | National Review
"Rep. Ilhan Omar criticizes Israel at Council on American-Islamic Relations fundraiser

Although not mentioned by name, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., clearly was on the minds of many speakers at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Washington.

Speaking at the conference on Sunday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland hit back at some of the most visible new Democrats in Congress: ""By the way, there are 62 new Democratic freshmen in the House, not three.""

Hoyer apparently was referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Omar, who regularly have fought the Trump administration's policies since entering Congress.

Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, said Sunday: ""Many of you know that there are people out there today, including in the halls of Congress, who believe that America supports Israel because AIPAC is powerful.""

Omar drew condemnation from members of both parties last month after she suggested in a tweet that AIPAC has been paying members of Congress to support Israel. She later apologized for the tweet -- and for other comments widely criticized as anti-Semitic -- but also insisted on what she called ""the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.""

Hoyer, in his speech Sunday, also condemned sanctions against Israel: ""Support for Israel should never be a partisan issue or be perceived as a partisan issue.""

At the end of his speech which lasted about 15 minutes, he said, ""Yes, we stand with Israel because we stand for America's security. Yes, we stand with Israel because we stand for freedom. Yes, we stand with Israel because we reject bigotry and prejudice.""

"The Post did not specify to which ""deference"" it was referring. Trump has taken a hardline approach toward Russia, rejecting its annexation of Crimea, sanctioning Russian entities and checking Russian influence in Syria among many other actions.

The newspaper's editorial board also stated as fact that Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to assist Trump in the presidential race when there was no consensus conclusion reached on that assessment by the U.S. intelligence community and serious questions have been raised about the unsubstantiated claim.

Shortly after the release of Attorney General William P. Barr's summary of Mueller's main conclusions on Sunday, the Washington Post published an editorial board piece titled, ""Trump did not collude with Russia. But he's wrong to say Mueller exonerated him.""

In the editorial, the Post allowed that Mueller's conclusion of no collusion, as per Barr's summary, ""should be a relief to Americans worried that the nation's senior leaders acted as agents of a foreign power during the 2016 election.""

The bizarre editorial, however, went on to advocate the conspiracy that Trump was allegedly deferring to Putin, and doing so to perhaps repay the Russian strongman for alleged help in the 2016 presidential race:

On the other hand, Mr. Trump's bizarre refusal to acknowledge the Russian interference, and his unceasing assaults on Mr. Mueller's investigation, are all the more confounding. It is still not out of the question that Mr. Trump's disturbing deference to Russian President Vladi¬≠mir Putin is repayment for the Kremlin's help during the presidential race. But it seems more likely that Mr. Trump is simply a Russian apologist. That is not comforting.

The January 6, 2017, U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) report by three intelligence agencies assessed the conclusion that Putin favored Trump and worked to get him elected only with a classification of ""moderate confidence,"" while the FBI and CIA gave it a ""high confidence"" rating.

The narrative of Russia seeking to get Trump elected was also partially challenged by the book of James Clapper, who served as director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration. It was Clapper's agency that released the Intelligence Community report.

And an extensive Republican House Intelligence Committee report charged that the IC's findings on the matter were colored by politics. The Republican House Intelligence Committee's 250-page report on alleged Russian collusion found that the IC assessment of Putin's strategic intentions for allegedly interfering in the U.S. election to aid Trump ""did not employ proper analytic tradecraft"" and contained ""significant intelligence tradecraft failings that undermine confidence"" in the judgments, including the failure to ""be independent of political considerations.""

As Breitbart News reported, Clapper's own book describes numerous shifts in Russia's alleged attitude toward Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.

At first, Clapper writes that Russia simply opposed Hillary Clinton and didn't favor one Republican presidential candidate. After Trump seemed initially poised to possibly win, Clapper relates an alleged Russian propaganda effort to aid Trump's victory in order to defeat Clinton. Toward the final stretch of the presidential campaign, with Trump's poll numbers falling, Clapper wrote that Russia shifted its position away from purportedly aiding Trump and focused mainly on opposing Clinton, even allegedly providing Green Party candidate Jill Stein with more favorable coverage.",102,Breitbart,WaPo: Maybe Trump 'Repaying' Putin for Kremlin's Election 'Help'
"ATLANTA - California Sen. Kamala Harris sent a subtle signal to the old-guard of Democratic politics that every era has its end.

At an Atlanta church service dedicated to youth Sunday, the presidential candidate compared leadership to a relay race in which each generation must ask themselves ""what do we do during that period of time when we carry that baton.""

Then she added with a smile that for ""the older leaders, it also becomes a question of let's also know when to pass the baton.""

The 54-year-old senator -- one of the younger contenders for the White House in 2020 -- did not mention any other presidential hopeful or tie her remarks to the Democratic presidential scramble. Her spokeswoman said she only wanted to encourage the youth at Ebenezer Baptist Church.

Her commentary to the congregation once led by Martin Luther King Jr. comes as former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, considers whether to join a field that already includes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is 77. Both men have run for president before and fallen short.

'Biden and Sanders are seen as strong contenders for the Democratic nomination, though other candidates and some voters have emphasized the need for a more youthful approach to try and beat President Donald Trump in the general election. Several other candidates in the race, including two governors, are also in their late sixties.

Harris noted Sunday that King was 26 when he led the Montgomery Bus Boycotts that pushed him to the forefront of the civil rights movement.

Later Sunday, Harris told a rally at Morehouse College in Atlanta that Attorney General William Barr should testify under oath on Capitol Hill, rather than just submit the written summary of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.

The Justice Department said Sunday that Mueller's team did not find evidence that Trump's campaign ""conspired or coordinated"" with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Mueller also investigated whether Trump obstructed justice but did not come to a definitive answer.

Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand assailed President Donald Trump as a coward who is ""tearing apart the moral fabric of the vulnerable,"" as she officially started her campaign for president.

The senator spoke in New York Sunday, feet away from one of Trump's signature properties, the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

She said that instead of building walls as Trump wants to do along the U.S.-Mexico border, Americans build bridges, community and hope.

Gillibrand also called for full release of Mueller's report in the Russia investigation. Attorney General William Barr released a summary Sunday afternoon, but Democrats want to see the full details.

Gillibrand is trying to position herself in the crowded field of Democrats seeking the party's nomination. While some hopefuls have shied away from mentioning Trump, Gillibrand has not hesitated to do so.

The Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate tells a campaign rally that if seven children were dying from a mysterious virus, ""we'd pull out all the stops till we figured out what was wrong."" But in terms of gun violence, she said the NRA ""keeps calling the shots in Washington.""

Warren finished a two-day campaign trip to New Hampshire with an event at a middle school in Conway Sunday afternoon.

Warren focused much of her speech on her approach to economics, but paid special attention to unions Sunday. She said more power needs to be put back in the hands of workers.

"City First Lady Chirlane ¬≠McCray will appear before the City Council Tuesday to ¬≠explain what exactly her mental-health project, ThriveNYC, has achieved before giving her $250 million a year for the next four years.

New Yorkers can be forgiven for failing to notice positive results, what with the ever-growing ranks of homeless mentally ill in our streets and subways (and prisons). As these pages have repeatedly argued, ThriveNYC hasn't been focused on helping the most seriously mentally ill.

Here, then, are 10 questions council members should ask the first lady to get to the root of that problem.

One: The first substantive statement that appears on ThriveNYC's Web site claims that ""stigma stops people from getting the care they need."" ThriveNYC's programmatic priorities reflect this belief. Yet in the past, when you wrote about your own daughter's struggles with mental health, you noted that finding a doctor, not public attitudes, was the biggest barrier to care. So which is it?

Two: In 2017, Gary Belkin, who at the time served as the city's mental-health chief and now leads policy and strategy for ThriveNYC, admitted to a reporter that only $165 million of the ThriveNYC's budgeted $850 million was allocated to people with serious mental illness, with the rest presumably directed to other issues. Doesn't that get things exactly backward, given the centrality of serious mental illness to the current crisis?

Three: You claim that ThriveNYC is a ""prevention"" program. But serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can't be prevented, because we still don't understand the causes. Do you really believe that ThriveNYC can prevent serious mental illness?

Four: Unemployment, bad grades, gender-identity angst, growing up with a single parent -- all can make people feel bad but aren't mental illnesses. Why, then, are you diverting mental-health funds to these issues, while 40 percent of the most seriously mentally ill people in New York go untreated?

Five: ThriveNYC has trained some 100,000 New Yorkers in Mental Health First Aid, or MHFA, which helps them identify people who don't show symptoms of mental illness. But the asymptomatic are not the problem -- the symptomatic are. Given that there is no research supporting MHFA's effectiveness, why do you continue to fund it?

Six: You claim to be measuring 400 metrics but that it is too early to know if ThriveNYC is working. Given that the number of homeless mentally ill, incarcerated mentally ill, suicides and calls to police about the mentally ill are all rising -- isn't it already clear that ThriveNYC isn't working? Why not focus on these concrete ¬≠metrics?

Seven: It is adults over 18 and ¬≠under 64 who are most likely to be hospitalized, homeless or incarcerated. So then why does the city¬≠budget show that your age-targeted programs mainly focus on people under 18 and over 64?

Eight: ThriveNYC is funding ads asking anyone who is ""under stress"" to call your mental-health hotline. But doesn't that describe nearly all New Yorkers? Again, why won't you target the ad campaign at people with serious mental illness? And why are the hotline operators telling people who need a crisis-intervention team to call the police instead?

Nine: Kendra's Law has dramatically reduced homelessness, arrest and incarceration of the seriously mentally ill and is therefore the most effective tool the city has to help the neediest cases. But even if it is true that you have increased use of Kendra's Law, there are still thousands more who should be in it. Why won't you push to expand Kendra's Law to serve all who could benefit from it?

Ten: You are distributing ThriveNYC funds based on identity politics. Favored groups include African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, LGBTQ people and so on. Is there any evidence that the funds are reaching the most seriously mentally ill residents within those subpopulations -- or are they going to community centers?

ThriveNYC is giving mental-health and social-services programs what they want: mental health funds without an obligation to serve the seriously mentally ill. The City Council should put an end to that and require all mental-health funds to be used where they can do the most good.",104,New York Post,What to ask Chirlane McCray about the ThriveNYC debacle
"Mass murderer Brenton Tarrant appears in court for the first time

A Christian friend whose opinion I respect very much has written me privately to object to the way I wrote recently about the New Zealand shootings, and the approach I have in general to writing about these issues. Earlier this week I had a similar conversation with a different Christian friend who was concerned in exactly the same way. I will not post details of those conversations here, for obvious reasons, and I will respond to my letter-writer privately, but if these friends are having the same reactions, I bet many of you are too. I should clear the air.

The specific thing that alarms them was the post I made a week ago, in the immediate aftermath of the Christchurch shooting, in which I cited parts of the killer's manifesto, and wrote:

Here's the chilling part: Everything Tarrant identifies as qualities of a disintegrating Western civilization is true.

It was clear in context of the entire post that I was not advocating for the killer. In fact, I wrote earlier in that same piece:

I will say here clearly that any reader who in any way attempts to justify this atrocity in New Zealand will NOT be posted. It was a despicable act, and if you pray, join me in praying for the souls of the murdered, and the families they left behind.

That said, some comments on the manifesto (you can read a general NYT report on it here). I read it in the same vein as I read the bloodthirsty Islamist fanatic Sayyid Qutb's work: as something that we have to understand, because it articulates quite clearly what we're up against -- and that it's not mere psychotic raving:

The Muslim writer Shadi Hamid makes the same point I was trying to make, but does so as a liberal, on Foreign Policy magazine's website, days after the massacre (versus one day after the massacre). He writes:

It's not quite right to say the suspect charged with killing 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, last week was ""crazy,"" or ""mad."" He was not ""insane."" He had thought quite clearly about why he did what he did and what he hoped to accomplish, captured in a 74-page manifesto. The arguments and motivations laid out in the document need to be taken seriously and not merely dismissed as the ravings of a fanatic. That's the only way to reckon with the gravity of what happened and to confront a threat that will be with us for decades to come.

It is reasonable that we would want to cast such an attack outside the realm of rationality, to tell ourselves that expressions of evil are random and unpredictable; it's the same impulse many had when faced with the brutality and terror of the Islamic State and other jihadi extremists. To rationalize evil as something irrational makes it easier to take on horrifying news. But to do that here would be a mistake.

Hamid goes on to say:

I support a strong response to the New Zealand attack. But for too many this seems to involve treating white nationalists -- a group that, according to some, includes a sizable chunk of the U.S. Republican Party -- the way Islamic extremists have long been treated: as a hostile outside force that must be destroyed.

Here's the core of Hamid's essay:

During the West's extended war against jihadism, many of us implored policymakers to think more broadly about the grievances, policy failures, and other drivers that made acts of violence more likely. It wasn't enough to say that ""they hate us for who we are,"" even when they did. Some of the grievances that Osama bin Laden and his associates cited (however cynically) -- the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, U.S. support for dictators, and debilitating sanctions inflicted upon Iraqis -- did not become illegitimate merely because they were uttered by a terrorist. And, for a time, the fact that extremists cited grievances that many ordinary Arabs and Muslims shared helped build up a reservoir of sympathy and even support for groups such as al Qaeda.

Just as it was with Islamic extremism, it is advisable to dismiss the grievances of white nationalists that are silly or conspiratorial but less so to dismiss the ones that reflect something real. In one section of the manifesto, the shooter cites seven factors that contribute to ""radicalization."" Not only are some of them not untrue, but they would also probably draw agreement across the political spectrum, such as the ""loss of worker rights,"" ""environmental degradation,"" and the ""collapse of Christianity."" We might wish it weren't so, but these three things may very well make radicalization more likely, all other things being equal. In some sense, they already have.

Read the whole thing. Please, please do. Hamid is telling the truth, though it's a truth that is more palatable when delivered by a Muslim than by a white Christian like me.

As Hamid writes in the essay, analysts like him have tried for years to point out to Westerners that they will never understand Islamic radicals, especially radical Islamic terrorists (not the same thing!), if they insist on framing the terrorists' motivations only in terms that make sense to them. Thus did we, in the early 2000s, have a common view, at least on the US mainstream right, that Al Qaeda and their kind carried out their acts of terror because Arab polities were denied the full fruits of liberal democracy and capitalism. The unspoken assumption was that the natural human condition is peaceful and cooperative, and that Islam (and all religion), in its natural state, was a force for peace.

None of this was true, or at least not true in the sense that Western policymakers wanted to believe. I recall very well how, when critics brought up the fact that Iraq was deeply divided along religious and tribal lines, and that democracy would not come easily to the Iraqis (if at all), those critics were denounced -- often by mainstream conservatives! -- as racists for denying that Arabs were capable of democracy.

That's not what these critics were saying at all, but the ""racist"" canard was used to silence an important debate on culture, history, politics, and social conflict. It turned out that the critics were exactly right -- and Iraq, then later Syria, paid a terrible price for our arrogance. You could be cynical and say that the Western neocon policymakers knew exactly what they were doing in denouncing their critics as racists. I don't believe that is the case. It is profoundly within the American imagination to think that liberal democracy is entirely consonant with human nature. I remember, to my shame, believing the Bush administration propaganda, circa 2002, that as soon as the dictator was taken out, the Iraqi people will flourish, as they were meant to do.

As I have written here before, deep and humiliated reflection on how I had gotten the Iraq War so wrong caused me to see and to admit that I, personally, had been driven by vengeance for 9/11. I would not have been able to accept that reality directly back in 2002, during the march-up to the Iraq War, because I would have recognized it as crude, unworthy, and no justification at all for war. So I cloaked my ugly (but all too human) rage and desire for vengeance in a raiment of idealism -- and that process required me to marginalize all those who insisted that the reality was more complicated than crusaders like me and my tribe wanted to believe.

It is hard for me to overemphasize how deeply the grand illusion of the Iraq War, which I initially supported, affected me, and still does. It reoriented the way I approach the world, in this particular way: it has compelled me to think a great deal about why people convince themselves that some things are true, and some things are false, despite evidence otherwise. In short, it made me profoundly doubt our capacity to reason, mostly because it is so very, very difficult to shake off our hidden motivations.

This 2003 essay by Paul Berman, published in The New York Times, is one I go back to frequently. It's about Sayyid Qutb (d. 1968), the philosopher who inspired Al Qaeda, and who is more or less the godfather of contemporary Islamic terrorism. Check out these passages:

I did not read all of In The Shade Of The Qur'an, or even most of it. But I read enough about it, and about Qutb (hanged by Nasser as a revolutionary) to understand how little we in the West really got about Qutb, who was a deep religious thinker. To read Qutb is to confront a man who is a bone-chilling ideologue, the kind of man who would not flinch to see innocents massacred. But -- and this is the part Westerners refuse to see -- Qutb makes a kind of sense, given his premises. And those premises are rooted in the reality of the situation the Arab Muslim world found itself in in modern times.

The point is not that Sayyid Qutb was right. I believe he was very, very wrong, dangerously so. The point is that you can't understand why Sayyid Qutb's philosophy appeals to young men if you bring a Western mindset, with Western prejudices, to your confrontation with him. I recall reading him and being completely appalled by it, but compelling myself to set aside my reactions and try to understand how these words would sound to an intelligent young man who believed his religion was true, and who was trying to make sense of why, even though he and his people had the True Faith, the Arab Muslim world suffered so much, and the unbelievers (Christians, the West) had triumphed. A lot of what Qutb says about the disintegrating qualities of modernity are simply true. Hell, Marx and Engels were telling the truth in The Communist Manifesto when they observed that industrial capitalism dissolved social bonds, customs, and institutions that had long been thought sacred.

That doesn't make communism true, any more than Qutb's analysis makes revolutionary Islamism true! But it does compel we who would fight these bloody, soul-crushing philosophies to try genuinely to understand why those ways of thinking and being in the world appeal to so many people, and set their minds on fire.

This is why I keep saying that we would do well to pay close attention to the real-world factors that are driving white nationalism and violent white supremacy. When I said in my post that

Here's the chilling part: Everything Tarrant identifies as qualities of a disintegrating Western civilization is true.

... what was ""chilling"" about it is that the factors the malefactor used to build his case for race war are actually real things. None of these things justifies shooting people, or racism in general. But, as Shadi Hamid writes about Tarrant's grievances:

Not only are some of them not untrue, but they would also probably draw agreement across the political spectrum, such as the ""loss of worker rights,"" ""environmental degradation,"" and the ""collapse of Christianity."" We might wish it weren't so, but these three things may very well make radicalization more likely, all other things being equal. In some sense, they already have.

Yes, and I would add the fears, however exaggerated, that native European populations have of being overwhelmed by foreigners at a time when their own birthrates are plummeting. You and I might find it weird and offensive that people would feel so tribalist about race, but this is something normal within human nature. Not having these reactions is the unusual thing.

I was just having a conversation with one of my children this morning about how society constructs narratives. He finds the kind of racism that was completely common in our part of the world when his grandparents were his age to be incomprehensible. He genuinely does not understand it, because he has never lived with it, and has been taught all his life that it's wrong. I explained to him that when I was younger, I had a lot of resentment against that generation of our ancestors over what they believed, and how they acted based on those beliefs. Much later -- as a matter of fact, as part of the process of thinking through how I had given myself over to the pro-Iraq War narrative -- I was finally able to put myself in the position of my parents' generation of rural Southern whites. They inherited the white supremacy narrative, and what's more, they were raised in an environment in which that narrative was never challenged.

There was no television. There were newspapers, but poor people didn't really read them. There was radio, but race was a taboo subject. If white churches talked about it at all, it was to deploy the Bible to justify the white supremacist ideology. In short, for the overwhelming majority of rural Southern whites born in the 1920s through the 1940s, there was no sense that white supremacy was a contestable narrative, or a narrative at all. It was just ... reality.

I was telling my son this morning about the extreme anxiety that came with the breakdown of that narrative in the 1960s and 1970s. My generation was the first in our town to go to fully integrated public schools. Heaven knows we were not paragons of racial tolerance, but it's more than a little amazing to me to think about how strange segregation and the beliefs that supported it seemed to white kids of my generation -- even though it had only ended a few years earlier. And now, to my own children, it might as well be something from another planet.

This is not the natural condition of humankind. This is an incredible achievement, bought with violence and struggle and sacrifice. It infuriates me to see how progressives today extol racist ideology when it benefits non-white people. It infuriates me because I know well how my generation, and subsequent generations, of white Southerners were liberated from white supremacist ideology by appeals to universalism, and to the universalist teaching of Christianity, our ancestral religion. Falling into racial/ethnic tribalism is the easiest thing in the world. It makes evolutionary sense. Tribalism has to be unlearned, and unlearning it is one of the greatest achievements of civilization.

So, when I see progressives using that achievement to attempt to grant race-based privileges to non-white groups, it makes me angry because it is unjust, and it makes me deeply anxious about social stability, because I know how fragile this universalism is. When I was born in 1967, some of the leading citizens in my town were members of the KKK. I didn't discover this until my adulthood, and it was a real shock, because all that recent history had been so deeply buried. Historically speaking, we have barely begun to live as a country as if race ought not matter, and that people ought to be judged not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character -- and now the Left is trying to destroy that social peace in the name of a twisted concept of social justice. As you've read in this space many times, whenever anti-white advocates (which include progressive white people) win their victories on college campuses and within academic and media institutions, I always say that they have no idea what kind of demons they are calling up.

These demons include evil people like Brenton Tarrant. I'm not trying to say Tarrant's existence is entirely the fault of others. He and he alone is responsible for his evil deeds. My point is that no terrorist -- not Brenton Tarrant, not Mohammed Atta, no one -- arises out of nowhere. If we want to understand how these evil men are fabricated, we have to do our best to enter into the world through their eyes.

When a people -- any people, of any race or religion -- feels existentially threatened, they are going to be highly susceptible to fear-based appeals. I've been there myself. In the days immediately following 9/11, like many other New Yorkers, I was scared to death, and prepared to believe rumors. On the day Katrina hit, I was living in Dallas, but was so afraid for my family back in south Louisiana that my boss sent me home from the office, because I was quietly freaking out. This is how people are. You're like this too.

Prosperous Western people who have been educated in Western institutions find ideologies like Tarrant's white supremacy to be abhorrent. As we should! But they never stop to think about how and why this kind of ideology appeals to people. They don't want to do this because they understandably fear that to let down one's guard is, in some sense, to risk sympathizing with the evil ones. I get that -- but it has to be done, or we're not going to see these threats coming, much less figure out how to stop them.

I have friends of a number of ethnic backgrounds, but I would be very surprised if any of them cared about the preservation of their own race. In my case, I don't care what race the future spouses of my children are, as long as they are serious Christians. I am deeply anxious about the loss of Christian faith, and I know well how much its survival depends on families upholding religious traditions in meaningful ways.

The Jewish religion is not like Christianity or Islam; it is passed on in part through bloodlines. The survival of Judaism in the United States is seriously threatened now by intermarriage with Gentiles. I completely understand why Jewish parents would not want their children to marry outside of Judaism -- even though this belief runs counter to our secular liberal culture. This is an excruciating dilemma for Jews, who have been among the greatest beneficiaries of liberalism, which has done a good job in fighting anti-Semitism. But now, having largely triumphed over anti-Semitism, liberalism is also dissolving Judaism in the West. Look at these numbers if you doubt me.

Why is it so difficult to imagine that Italians, French, Hungarians, and others in Europe are frightened to see their own native populations rapidly declining? Why is it so hard to imagine their fear in the face of their own population declines -- which is their fault for choosing not to have more kids -- when immigration into their countries is increasing? Last week I wrote in this space (""Disintegration And Its Discontents"") about watching a few years back black residents of my hometown parish (county) react to a proposal for a new reform plan of government with anger and race-driven paranoia. I wrote:

Their anger and anxiety made no logical sense -- until you thought about how much they endured under white supremacy, and how they were watching their political power slip through their fingers, because their population had declined so starkly in a single lifetime.

There was no way they could get what they wanted, politically. They just did not have the numbers within the polity to sustain the power they once, all to briefly, held. The new system was not designed to disempower them at all. They had simply failed to show up for the future, same as the native European populations today (though in the case of Europeans, it's a matter of sub-replacement fertility; in my home parish, it's a matter of long-term economic in-migration of whites and out-migration of blacks). The point is, managing this kind of loss within a community's members, and not just treating them as history's sore losers, requires a lot of political skill, including the ability to empathize with the displaced, and in a more meaningful way than simply pulling a long face and saying, pro forma, ""I'm sorry for your loss.""

Some of you hate it when I say that the unabashedly racist 1973 French novel The Camp Of The Saints is worth reading as part of a broader attempt to understand the social and political reality of this moment of historical crisis. When I finally picked it up in 2015, as Europe was struggling with the exodus of refugees from the Middle East, getting through it was hard, because it's not especially well written, and there are passages that are truly ugly. The one thing I gained from the novel was an appreciation for the way its author, Jean Raspail, absolutely nailed the weakness and mendacity of European elites in the face of mass migration. In the book, they did everything they could to minimize what the coming invasion meant, and then to rationalize their refusal to defend their countries by saying in various ways that the invaders gave Europe a chance to redeem itself for the sins of its colonial past, and so forth.

In that sense, this 1973 novel could have been written today. It matters because in the book, the protagonist and his confederates, seeing that all is lost, go on a murderous rampage once the invasion force of economic refugees lands on the French coast in their vast flotilla. If Europe is lost, they're going to take down everybody they can in an orgy of apocalyptic violence.

What good (""good"") will such a fictional scenario do us? Raspail's scenarios are hyper-exaggerated, but they compel us to see ourselves and our historical situation in a light that we resist. Raspail's portrait of a European elite that simply will not deal with the existential crisis upon the nation, and that is itself so consumed by self-hatred that they are willing to yield to a very different kind of invader than in ages past, is one that no small number of Europeans hold. As with the black citizens of my home parish who found themselves losing political power, those native-born Europeans who feel more and more threatened by migrants are bound to react with anger and even racism. This is a normal human response. To recognize that normal human beings are prone to react this way when confronted by a crisis like this is not necessarily to say that they are correct to act that way. It's only to say that it is predictable, and any politician who doesn't grasp that fact is a self-deluded fool.

It is a frustrating fact of life that sometimes, bad people and immoral works of art tell us truths that are important to our survival. We have to develop the skill to separate art from the artist and truth from the liar. Sayyid Qutb and Karl Marx, for example, have the blood of many innocents on their hands. But their ideas wouldn't have moved so many people to action if they were entirely nonsensical, and not based on kernels of truth about society, about history, about human nature, and so on.

Here's a recent Bloomberg Week story about how letting in more migrants than the relatively small country could readily absorb has caused trouble for liberal Sweden. Excerpts:

The longest political standoff in Sweden's history ended on Jan. 18 with the government looking much as it had before elections were held four months earlier. Stefan Lofven, leader of the moderate Social Democrats, was again named prime minister, while the nationalist Sweden Democrats continue to be isolated in Parliament. The new four-party alliance hailed its agreement as a victory against insurgent forces of racism and intolerance.

In reality, the deal merely papers over the discontent that's been eating away at Swedish liberalism since the beginning of the Syrian refugee crisis. An influx of migrants has stretched the country's social services to near the breaking point -- a situation the governing agreement fails to address. Sweden Democrats received almost 18 percent of the September vote, and their sidelining in the government could further alienate that substantial and growing voting bloc.

More, about the city of Malmo, which has the highest percentage of immigrants relative to the population:

Nationalists around the world have cited Malmo as an example of what can go wrong in a welfare society. Gang violence has long been a problem, especially in crowded, run-down areas. In Almgarden, a neighborhood about evenly split between white Swedes and immigrant families, 41 percent of residents voted for the Sweden Democrats, among the highest percentages of any district in the country. ""People think all criminality stems from immigration,"" says Almgarden resident Jeanette Palsson. Some of her neighbors have become increasingly hostile. ""We have friends who we struggle to hang out with, especially outside, because they're openly racist.""

More than a dozen cameras were put up last March along a kilometer-long stretch in Rosengard, the high-crime neighborhood that encompasses Almgarden. These have helped curb violence. There was a stabbing a few months ago; officers apprehended the killer within 15 minutes thanks to the surveillance, says Malmo police superintendent Stefan Wredenmark. ""We have journalists coming here all the time, and when they see this area their reaction often is that 'this isn't a war zone,'‚Ää"" he says. ""It used to be a no-go zone, but it's not anymore."" While certain types of highly visible crimes, including deadly shootings, have gone up, ""the number of reported crimes -- the general crime rate -- is going down,"" says fellow superintendent Glen Sjogren.

For longtime Malmo residents like pensioner Yvonne Vigstrand -- as well as other Swedes attempting to cling to the values that made the country a beacon of liberal democracy -- that comes as little comfort. She opposes the Sweden Democrats, but she can understand how there was a surge in support for the nationalists. Now they just add to the climate of fear in Sweden. ""Nothing has ever happened to me, so I have no reason not to feel safe,"" she says. ""But I won't go out late at night.""

Read the whole thing.

Now, to be sure, the Christchurch killer Brenton Tarrant appears (from what we know so far) to have been an extremist who never himself suffered from any negative migration fallout. He seems like an unstable and socially maladapted man who found in a racist crusade a channel for his rage and inner turmoil -- just like many of the men who become Islamic terrorists. The point here is not to justify any of this, but to understand the social conditions that play a role in producing alienated men with a politically or religiously motivated desire to commit mass murder.

No society is ever entirely free of psychopaths, but there are things societies can do to make it less likely that those who are mentally disturbed can and will act out their deadly fantasies. More prosaically, there are things societies can do to make it less likely that its members who have reason to feel alienated, lost, or displaced will react to their losses by resorting to malice, bigotry, and even violence. This is a massive political challenge. In Sweden, for example, the left-wing idealists, by continuing to bring refugees in as a way to prove their virtue, are straining their system to the breaking point, and creating conditions that will inevitably lead to backlash -- a backlash whose forms will be nationalist, even racist.

If you won't listen to me, listen to Shadi Hamid: the wrong way to deal with the threat from violent white nationalism is merely to treat it as something to be destroyed, simple as that. We need to take seriously the sense of siege that many whites feel, as the result of high migration levels to their particular communities, and in the face of diminishing numbers (and concomitant loss of political power). We need to take seriously the collapse of Christian belief, and what it means in terms of depriving people of a faith that ameliorated suffering, gave them a sense of meaning and purpose, and restrained malice. We need to take seriously the vulnerability of working class people in an age of globalized capitalism and technological advancement taking their jobs. And so forth.

And we damn sure had better stop deepening and widening our lines of fracture via this ""identity politics are fine for me, but not for thee"" strategy that so very many on the Left unthinkingly embrace. Identity politics on all sides are a Thing today because instability frightens people, and causes them to fall back on tribal loyalties. Liberal democracy is a fragile achievement. It might not survive the trials of our present age. Making a real effort to understand how marginalized people see the world -- even marginalized people we are predisposed to dislike, even hate -- is an important part of defending social stability, on which our own liberty and prosperity depends.

Now, there is the matter of timing. Another friend pointed out that it wasn't right for me to be saying that things in Tarrant's manifesto were true while the bodies of his victims were still warm. That's a fair criticism, one I've received before with reference to other hot takes. Part of it is a hazard of the medium. When a horrible event like the Christchurch massacre happens, I try to think of something truthful and useful that I can say that doesn't mirror what everyone else said. As I replied to my critical friend, acknowledging his point, the Unabomber's manifesto said some true things about technological society, but it's probably better to wait until David Gelernter, one of that monster's victims, to get out of the hospital before pointing that fact out.

One last point: it's not just guilt over the Iraq War, and how I allowed myself to see only what I wanted to see in the walk-up to that event, that drives me in cases like this. Some years back, before I live where I now live, I was involved with an institution that faced a threat to its existence. I and one other person there saw the problem early on, and told the leaders of the institution what was happening, and what was likely to happen if they didn't act to address the threat. They refused to do it, and angrily blamed us for exaggerating the problem. Nothing we could do worked, so we stood down and withdrew. Before long, everything we told them would happen did, in fact, happen -- and the result was so catastrophic that it destroyed the institution.

It was a small thing in the history of the world, granted, but the institution (which I'm not naming, to protect the privacy of those who worked with it -- you wouldn't know it anyway) meant a lot to me. The leadership did not want to hear what my colleague and I were saying back then, because if we were right, then some of their moral convictions, and their views on how the world worked, would be brought into question. People they thought were good would actually turn out to have been bad, and vice versa. And, the leaders would have had to have made decisions that they didn't want to make. It was much easier for them to say that we were wrong, and were bad people for pointing these things out. So that's what they did -- and it brought down the entire small organization.

I don't bring this up to say, I told you so! There's no point in that. There is no vindication in having been right. A small institution that I and others loved and cared for is no longer here, because key people -- good people, too! -- allowed their emotional unwillingness to face inconvenient truths drive their decision-making, in the face of clear and unambiguous facts that told a different story. Though a number of years have passed since all that went down, I think about it a lot, because that whole thing broke my heart irreparably. Just last week something brought it to mind, and I somewhat reproach myself, wondering if I should have not have shut up after being rebuffed, but instead shouted at the leadership to get them to recognize the existential instability they were introducing into the institution. Anyway, I tell you this so you'll know that this is one factor that drives me to say things in this space with imprudent timing. Doesn't make it right, but it explains it, in part. Which, nearly 6,000 words ago, is what I set out to do with this post.",105,The American Conservative,Learning From Bad People And Bad Ideas
"Attorney General William Barr's Sunday letter to Congress leaves no doubt: Three years of investigation, including two years under special counsel Robert Mueller, found no evidence of Team Trump ""collusion"" with Russia.

Yes, the news is a bit less definitive on the ""obstruction"" front: Barr says Mueller's findings were ""not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,"" but that basically boils down to the Washington establishment's distaste for the way President Trump fired FBI chief Jim Comey, and raged against the Mueller probe as a ""witch hunt.""

Crucially, Barr says that the president's questionable actions ""were not done with corrupt intent."" That is: Trump knew he hadn't colluded, and acted accordingly toward those who seemed bent on suggesting otherwise to the American public.

Three years of intensive work by the nation's best prosecutors and investigators resulted only in convicting Paul Manafort on crimes that had nothing to do with Trump or the 2016 campaign (and for skullduggery that also involved top Democratic lobbyists), plus a host of ""process"" charges (mostly lying to the FBI or Congress) against various peripheral Trump associates.

Oh, and indictments against a host of Russians for meddling in the 2016 campaign -- but not in cooperation with Team Trump.

None of that -- zero, zilch, nada -- validates the years of breathless reporting about the investigations, nor (for example) the repeated claims of top House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff that he had seen serious evidence of collusion.

For more than two years, America has been assured time and again that Mueller was onto clear evidence of Trump treason, more or less -- and now it all stands exposed as wishful fantasies and outright lies.

Trump's 2016 team did indeed sign up some pathetic third-raters, plus the sleazoid Manafort. The odious Roger Stone was a hanger-on, too.

But cleaner and better talent (especially from the GOP foreign- and national-security establishments) wouldn't touch the long-shot populist campaign.

The Trump camp shouldn't have hired Manafort or self-promoters like George Papadopolous. But none of them ever mattered.

The whole sorry affair shows at its core that Democrats just couldn't and still can't come to grips with 2016. They can't believe Americans don't think the way they do and so have to blame something, anything, for what went wrong.

But that doesn't excuse all the supposedly neutral federal functionaries who seized on the ""Steele dossier,"" a Clinton-campaign-funded hit produced by the smear merchants of FusionGPS to paint an utterly false picture of Trump treason, to launch the initial investigation.

Attorney General Barr's clear duty going forward going forward (and that of FBI chief Christopher Wray) is to discover and expose every official in the Justice Department and the national-security and intelligence bureaucracies who put partisan politics ahead of justice and the national interest -- abusing key security powers such as FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrants -- to launch an investigation that now stands exposed as an obscene miscarriage of justice.",106,New York Post,"Zero, zilch, nada: That's the bottom line on 'collusion'"
"ATLANTA - California Sen. Kamala Harris sent a signal to the old guard of Democratic politics that every era has its end.

At an Atlanta church service Sunday, the presidential candidate compared leadership to a relay race in which each generation must ask themselves ""what do we do during that period of time when we carry that baton.""

Then she added with a smile that for ""the older leaders, it also becomes a question of let's also know when to pass the baton.""

At 54 years old, Harris is one of the younger contenders for the White House in 2020. While former Vice President Joe Biden has not said whether he will run, both the 76-year-old and 77-year-old Bernie Sanders have previously run for the White House and fallen short.

Biden and Sanders are seen as strong contenders for the Democratic nomination, though other candidates and some voters have emphasized the need for a more youthful approach to try and beat President Donald Trump in the general election. Several other candidates in the race, including two governor, are also in their late sixties.

Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand assailed President Donald Trump as a coward who is ""tearing apart the moral fabric of the vulnerable,"" as she officially started her campaign for president.

The senator spoke in New York Sunday, feet away from one of Trump's signature properties, the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

She said that instead of building walls as Trump wants to do along the U.S.-Mexico border, Americans build bridges, community and hope.

Gillibrand also called for full release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report in the Russia investigation. Attorney General William Barr released a summary Sunday afternoon, but Democrats want to see the full details.

Gillibrand is trying to position herself in the crowded field of Democrats seeking the party's nomination. While some hopefuls have shied away from mentioning Trump, Gillibrand has not hesitated to do so.

ELIZABETH WARREN

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday the National Rifle Association is holding ""Congress hostage"" when it comes to stemming gun violence.

The Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate tells a campaign rally that if seven children were dying from a mysterious virus, ""we'd pull out all the stops till we figured out what was wrong."" But in terms of gun violence, she said the NRA ""keeps calling the shots in Washington.""

Warren finished a two-day campaign trip to New Hampshire with an event at a middle school in Conway Sunday afternoon.

Warren focused much of her speech on her approach to economics, but paid special attention to unions Sunday. She said more power needs to be put back in the hands of workers.

BETO O'ROURKE

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke told voters in Las Vegas Sunday that President Donald Trump bears blame for the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border but responsibility lies with everyone in the country to fix the situation.

O'Rourke spoke Sunday to more than 200 people packed into and snaking around a taco shop on the city's north end. He said immigrant families are leaving their home countries and journeying on foot because they have no other choice.

The former Texas congressman said desperate families were broken up in the U.S. when they were at their most vulnerable and desperate moments, and what happened to them ""is on every single one of us.""

""We are here to reject the politics of fear and hate,"" said Gillibrand, who was recently elected to her second term. ""We are here to embrace our shared humanity and rise above our differences.""

""The people of this country deserve a president who is worthy of your bravery,"" she added. ""Your bravery inspires me every day and that is why I'm running for President of the United States.""

To underscore the point, New York's junior Senator made the declaration from a stage erected on Central Park West in front of one of the president's signature New York City properties -- the gold-and-brass-plated Trump International Hotel and Tower that sits on the fabled boulevard.

""President Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of our country,"" blistered Gillibrand. ""He demonizes the vulnerable and he punches down.

""He does this because he wants you to believe he's strong. He is not,"" she added. ""Our president is a coward.""

The state's junior Senator announced in January she would explore a presidential bid and has spent the last two months touring the key early states in the battle for the Democratic nomination, including making trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

Gillibrand's announcement comes even as she has received a cool reception as she dipped her toe in the early presidential waters.

Not a single Iowa voter picked Gillibrand as their first choice in a recent poll conducted by The Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom.

Back home, the reception hasn't been much better. Just 29 percent of New York voters gave Gillibrand a favorable rating in a Quinnipiac poll released last week, a surprisingly mediocre performance considering she rolled to reelection just four months ago.

Gillibrand joins a crowded field of two dozen Democrats who are either eyeing White House runs or have declared their candidacy, which remains heavily in flux.

The party's 2016 runner-up, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has already jumped into the race and former Vice President Joe Biden is widely expected to throw his hat in the ring as well.

Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rouke, meanwhile, has managed to raise more than $6 million in 24 hours after announced his campaign.

Two of the party's rising stars in the Senate are running, too: California U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Corey Booker

Plus, self-described policy wonk, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is in the race. And even South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- a veteran and Rhodes Scholar -- is getting ink as a possible dark horse.

And the field may soon grow even more crowded.

Mayor Bill de Blasio has eyed the White House contest for more than a month in the face of tough headlines in city papers and mediocre poll numbers from New York voters, though he insists he has made no decision yet.

Hizzoner, who is term-limited, traveled to Washington D.C. this weekend and will participate in a forum as part of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee Sunday afternoon and address the gathering on Monday.

That trip comes on the heels of his forays to New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa, where he road-tested possible rationales for a presidential bid before often tiny, but friendly audiences.",108,New York Post,Gillibrand kicks off 2020 campaign by calling Trump a 'coward'
"The Democratic contenders for their party's presidential nomination are offering the most radical policy positions since the failed presidential campaign of Sen. George McGovern (D-SD) in 1972.

From the ""Green New Deal"" -- a socialist policy nearly every Democratic now supports -- to ""Medicare for All"" and even reparations for slavery, Democrats are proposing extremist ideas that enjoy almost no support from the American electorate as a whole.

Republicans who are nervous about 2020, given the constant assault on President Donald Trump by the media and the opposition, are cheered by the Democrats' rush to the far-left. Some note the rise of energetic, social-media-savvy ""democratic socialists,"" such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Some credit the influence of Trump himself, whose success in disrupting conventional politics has encouraged Democrats to be their authentic selves.

But the real reason Democrats have become so radical may be that Trump has effectively seized the middle ground of American politics. While governing as the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan -- given his judicial appointments, his staunch pro-life policies, his rollback of the administrative state, among other policies -- Trump has made his toughest political stands in favor of common-sense positions that are broadly supported by the public.

Take, for example, his fight for the border wall. Though we are often told that Americans want to offer illegal aliens a ""path to citizenship,"" the overwhelming majority also wants to secure the border first, so that any amnesty offered will be the last. A recent poll showed a majority of Americans preferred a border wall to the Green New Deal. Few Americans want open borders, which is the de facto position of the Democratic Party and most of its candidates.

Likewise with Trump's stand on trade. The free-trade consensus in Washington, DC, has long been at odds with the consensus in the rest of the country, which likes the benefits of free trade but also wants the government to fight for fairness in international commerce. Thus far, Trump's trade war with China has hurt a few industries -- most notably agriculture -- but the anticipated price increases have not appeared. His position is simple seen as common sense.

Few Democrats want to be seen supporting Trump. But given Trump's ostentatious support for middle-of-the-road policies -- including preserving Medicare and Social Security -- the only way for them to create ""clear blue water"" between themselves and the incumbent has been to offer the electorate eccentric socialist dogma. Despite their contempt for Trump, he has maneuvered them into a political position from which it will be very difficult to win.",109,Breitbart,Pollak: Democrats Embrace Socialism Because Trump Has Seized the Middle Ground | Breitbart
"MADRID - There will be lots of politics to talk about when Venezuela takes on a Catalonia squad in a friendly soccer game in Spain on Monday.

Venezuela has a coach who offered his resignation over the alleged political use of his national team, while Catalonia -- the region in the middle of an independence dispute with Spain -- will be missing players because some non-Catalan teams didn't release them.

Venezuela is coming off a convincing 3-1 win over Lionel Messi's Argentina on Friday, but what attracted most of the attention after the friendly was an announcement by Venezuela coach Rafael Dudamel. He offered his resignation because he was not happy with the politicization of a pre-game visit by a representative of Juan Guaido, the man challenging Nicolas Maduro's claim to the presidency in Venezuela.

Dudamel and the rest of the squad had welcomed the visit but the coach apparently did not like that images were later released to the public.

""Regrettably, they politicized the visit,"" Dudamel said. ""The agreement was that if there was any image or video, it would have been used internally only. But they politicized the visit, and we can't allow that to happen. It was regrettable how they used it.""

Venezuela is in the middle of a power struggle since Maduro's re-election last year was deemed illegitimate by several governments.

Dudamel said he will remain in charge of the squad on Monday, but his future will depend on talks with Venezuelan soccer federation officials in the coming days.

Catalonia has also undergone political turmoil, peaking recently in 2017 with an independence referendum not recognized by Madrid. The issue divided Spain at the time and remains a hot topic politically.

Although the region is not independent, Catalonia has often put together squads to play in friendly matches against other nations.

Among the Catalan players expected to play on Monday are veterans Gerard Pique and Xavi Hernandez. Both have retired from the Spanish national team and are off-duty with their clubs because of the international break.

Hernandez, a 39-year-old midfielder, currently plays in Qatar. The 32-year-old Pique, still a starter with Barcelona, decided to stop playing with Spain's national team after the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

But other players initially selected for the squad were not released by their clubs, who said their decisions were not related to politics.

Valladolid, which is fighting relegation from the top tier of the Spanish league, was the first team to keep its players from taking part in Monday's match, and Rayo Vallecano and Huesca -- also threatened by relegation -- later followed suit.

""We understand the reasons why these clubs are not going to let their players play,"" Catalonia coach Gerard Lopez said.

The match will be played in Girona, a Catalan city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Barcelona.

"PARIS - Catherine Norris Trent, a British citizen who has lived in Paris since 2007, rushed to become French before her native country left the European Union. She worried Brexit might force her to leave her French partner and their two young children.

While the EU has promised to allow Britons living in France and other member countries to stay after the U.K. pulls out, Norris Trent said she saw French citizenship as the one certain way to protect her right to remain.

""Brexit was definitely a factor that gave my request urgency,"" Norris Trent, 38, a television journalist who is among France's estimated 150,000 British residents, said. ""I don't want my family to be split apart. It's a terrifying prospect.""

As France conferred her second nationality during a spectacular one-hour ceremony last week, Norris Trent left her politics-induced fears at the door of Paris' monumental Pantheon, where French literary luminaries such as Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Emile Zola are buried.

She, along with a throng of others who sought to become citizens, were welcomed by a school choir that sang French national anthem ""La Marseillaise"" beside a floodlit bust of Marianne, the national symbol. They watched a film called ""Become French"" that explained French national values such as secularism, respect for cultural diversity and gender equality.

The new citizens proudly clutched French birth certificates, excerpts from the French Constitution and a signed letter from French President Emmanuel Macron saying, ""France is proud and happy to welcome you.""

Hundreds of kilometers away in Brussels, British Prime Minister Theresa May waited to find out if the leaders of the 27 remaining EU countries would agree to delay Brexit day. For almost two years, Britain's departure was set to take effect this month, on March 29.

But U.K. lawmakers have refused to approve the agreement on withdrawal terms and future relations May's government negotiated with the EU, creating fears of a disruptive ""no-deal Brexit"" that could lead to shortages of food and medicine, tie up traffic on roads, airports and ports where border controls area reintroduced, and upend the lives of ex-pats throughout Europe.

The European leaders refused to extend the Brexit deadline until June 30 as May requested. Instead, they said Britain's pull-out could wait until May 22 if the prime minister could persuade Parliament to pass the twice-rejected agreement.

If lawmakers still refuse the deal, the leaders gave Britain until April 12 to choose between leaving the EU without a divorce deal and setting a radically different path such as revoking the decision to leave.

""I don't recognize the rhetoric in the U.K. anymore. I don't want to close the door on the European project,"" Norris Trent said. ""This is about protecting my family against populism and closing borders,"" she said.

France's Interior Ministry recorded 3,173 British citizens who became French ones in 2017, an eightfold increase compared to the year before, when U.K. voters decided to leave the EU. Numbers for 2018 are not yet available.

France has its own problems, of course, including persistent discrimination against residents with immigrant backgrounds despite a national motto proclaiming equality for all. On the day Norris Trent became a citizen, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe spoke during another naturalization ceremony at the Pantheon about the country's alarming rise in anti-Semitism.

But Macron is a fierce champion of the European Union, both its practical elements such as open borders and the idea it represents of European unity built from the ashes of World War II.

""Generations of men and women... contributed to give (France) the identity it has today: a welcoming nation that protects human values,"" Macron said in the letter addressed to each new French citizen.

The Pantheon has only been used for French citizenship ceremonies since 2017. The monument, a former church built in the 18th century that has become a famous mausoleum, has symbolism of its own.

Several of the well-known figures buried there were born in other countries and became naturalized French citizens, including French-Polish scientist Marie Curie. Norris Trent suggested French authorities chose the location to impress new citizens with the splendor and inclusive history of their adopted country.

""What a stunning place to become French. It's better than a pokey town hall,"" Norris Trent said. ""You really feel privileged, and so it's quite a clever strategy.""

"The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) begins its annual policy conference Sunday in unusual circumstances.

First, the organization has been the target of antisemitic attacks by a member of Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Second, it is being boycotted by left-wing groups that are claiming credit for persuading Democratic presidential candidates to avoid the conference (though few attend in non-election years anyway).

Saikat Chakrabarti, the chief of staff and political strategist for ""phenom"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), put the two together late last week and congratulated Omar, effectively, for using antisemitic rhetoric to accomplish the boycott. The fact that Democrats celebrate such tactics, rather than punishing them, is a new and dangerous watershed in American politics. And it is a sign that AIPAC's traditional fa√ßade of bipartisanship is badly damaged.

Third, President Donald Trump just announced the U.S. recognizes Israel's claim to the Golan Heights, the high ground Israel took from Syria in the defensive Six-Day War in 1967, ending the shelling of Israeli civilians and creating a strategic buffer vital to the country's survival during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Trump's acknowledgment was a win for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- and a setback for Iran and Russia.

Add the Golan Heights to the major milestones Trump has achieved for the U.S-Israel relationship in the past year, including the moving of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. These were policy priorities for AIPAC, but Trump achieved them without AIPAC's support -- and, in some respects, despite AIPAC's opposition. (AIPAC offered a cringe-worthy apology to then-President Barack Obama after Trump criticized him from the podium at the 2016 policy conference, and some delegates in the audience applauded.)

Aside from supporting a close U.S.-Israel alliance in general, the last major unachieved policy priority for AIPAC is a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. The Trump administration is set to announce its plan after the April 9 elections in Israel. AIPAC's only path back to political relevance, and bipartisanship, is to support Trump's plan.

And so, ironically, the group reviled by the left for backing Israel, and defamed by the left-wing radicals at J Street for being lukewarm towards a two-state solution, will be the most important voice for peace in Washington, DC.

Or rather, it could be -- if AIPAC stops trying to avoid the appearance of being too pro-Trump, and acknowledges the undeniable fact that Donald Trump has been the most pro-Israel president in the history of the U.S.",112,Breitbart,Pollak: AIPAC's Last Resort Is to Support Trump's Middle East Peace Plan | Breitbart
"The Constitution makes clear that legislative redistricting is a matter for the states and Congress, not the courts, to sort out.

If an adjective creates a redundancy, does preceding it with two other adjectives give the Supreme Court a reason to venture where it has never gone before? Come Tuesday, the Court will hear oral arguments urging it to referee gerrymandering in the drawing of congressional districts. The justices should, like Ulysses, listen to this siren song but bind themselves from obeying it.

The arguments will concern two cases: one from Maryland, where Republicans are aggrieved, another from North Carolina, where Democrats are unhappy. The practice the court will consider is (adjective one) ""partisan gerrymandering."" This modifier, however, does not modify; there is no other kind of gerrymandering.

Tuesday's issue is whether the court should attempt something for which it has neither an aptitude nor any constitutional warrant -- concocting criteria for deciding when (adjective two) excessive partisan gerrymandering becomes (adjective three) unconstitutional.

Gerrymandering is generally as surreptitious as a brass band and is, always and everywhere, as political as lemonade is lemony. It is the drawing of district lines by faction A for the purpose of disadvantaging faction B. This practice is older than the republic: Pennsylvanians and North Carolinians were engaging in it in the first half of the 18th century, about a century before it acquired its name. (In 1812, Massachusetts Democratic-Republicans, serving Governor Elbridge Gerry, drew a district shaped like a salamander.)

Until 1962, the court stayed away from the inherently political process of the drawing of district lines by legislatures organized along partisan lines because the Constitution is unambiguous: ""The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof."" There are enough open-textured terms in the Constitution (""establishment"" of religion, ""unreasonable"" searches, ""cruel"" punishments, etc.) to rescue the Supreme Court from ennui. The elections clause just quoted contains no such terms. (Although four years ago five misguided justices said ""legislature"" can mean a commission vested with redistricting power taken away by referendum from a state legislature.)

Furthermore, the political realists who framed the Constitution, and who understood the pervasiveness of partisanship, added the following to the elections clause quoted above: Congress may ""at any time by law make or alter such regulations"" as the states might write regarding congressional elections. So, the Constitution is explicit: Congress, not the judiciary, is the federal remedy for alleged defects in the drawing of congressional districts. The political branches of the state and federal governments are assigned to deal with the inherently value-laden politics of drawing district lines.

In 1872, 92 years before the court found a constitutional requirement (equal protection of the laws) for ""one person, one vote,"" Congress had said that districts must contain ""as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants."" This stipulation was strictly enforced after 1964, when the court enunciated the simple and neutral principle of numerically equal districts.

There can, however, be nothing simple or neutral about what opponents of gerrymandering want to inveigle the court into trying to devise. These include criteria for measuring unconstitutional excesses in the common practices of ""cracking"" (dispersing one party's voters across districts dominated by the other party) and ""packing"" (one party concentrating the other party's voters into supermajorities in a few districts). And the political-science professoriate stands ready to eagerly tutor the court about ""wasted votes"" resulting from ""efficiency gaps.""

Today, people who are unhappy about North Carolina's gerrymandering argue (as a lower court did) that ""the Constitution does not authorize state redistricting bodies to engage in . . . partisan gerrymandering"" (emphasis added). Now, there is a perverse doctrine: Everything is forbidden that the Constitution does not explicitly authorize.

Those who are eager to sink the judiciary waist-deep into the politics of politics resort to blunderbuss arguments. For example, they say they have suffered justiciable injury because gerrymandering ""dilutes"" their votes and infringes their First Amendment rights -- even though everyone everywhere remains free to associate with his or her party of choice, and campaign and vote for any candidate.

The Constitution is silent regarding limits on state legislatures' partisan redistricting practices and is explicit regarding Congress's exclusive power to modify these practices. If the court nevertheless assigns a portion of this power to itself, its condign punishment, inflicted after each decennial census, will be avalanches of litigation arising from partisan unhappiness about states' redistricting plans. And no matter how the court decides each case, its reputation as a nonpolitical institution will be steadily tarnished.",113,nationalreview.com,SCOTUS Should Steer Clear of the Politics of Gerrymandering | National Review
"Elizabeth Warren wants to change the Constitution, end the Electoral College

Democratic Party presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign announced the candidate's next scheduled visits to Iowa on Saturday - amid talk that the senator from Massachusetts may be viewed as too much of a policy wonk to win the party's 2020 nomination.

Warren will return to Iowa March 29-30 with plans to speak at a rally in Storm Lake, hold meet-and-greets in Marshalltown and Perry, and attend an organizing event in West Des Moines, FOX 28 of Cedar Rapids reported.

WILL THE 3 B'S (BETO, BIDEN AND BERNIE) LEAVE ELIZABETH WARREN ON THE SIDELINES IN 2020?

But her focus on breaking up tech giants, ending the electoral college, imposing lobbying bans on elected officials after they leave office and establishing universal pre-K and child care programs - all popular ideas with many Democratic voters - don't seem to be translating into actual support for Warren, NPR reported.

""You hear from people that [Warren] sort of reminds them of Hillary [Clinton], which they mean in a purely stylistic sense,"" Michelle Goldberg, a New York Times columnist, said on the newspaper's podcast the Argument. ""It leads me to wonder: What is the salience of policy in a Democratic primary -- or in our politics at all?""

""You hear from people that [Warren] sort of reminds them of Hillary [Clinton], which they mean in a purely stylistic sense.""

-- Michelle Goldberg, New York Times columnist

""I just don't know if she would go over nationally,"" former New Hampshire state Rep. Daniel Hansberry told the Associated Press. He was among 27 current and former state lawmakers who signed a 2015 letter urging Warren to seek the presidency.

""In the Northeast and on the West Coast I wouldn't be a bit surprised if she got a huge vote,"" Hansberry said. ""But I don't know if she's too progressive for other parts of the country.""

In other words, when it comes time to choose a candidate, many voters may prefer the sizzle rather than the steak.

That concept may explain why Donald Trump topped Hillary Clinton in 2016, Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution wrote soon after that election.

""What Donald Trump did during the campaign was to paint in a very broad brush,"" Reeves wrote. ""Rather than having a debate about immigration policy in the round, [Trump asked], 'Are you for or against the wall? Are you for or against the Muslim ban?'""

Warren's failure to catch fire seems reflected in dollars: A federal filing shows she raised at least $300,000 on the day she launched her campaign - far short of the $6.1 million raised by former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, the $6 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or the $1.5 million raised by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

Nevertheless, Warren seems to be sticking with the idea that in 2020 the devil - i.e, the votes - may be in the details.

""The rules of our economy are so rigged in favor of the rich and powerful,"" Warren recently told Time magazine, ""that we can't afford to just tinker around the edges. Our fight is for big, structural change.

""The rules of our economy are so rigged in favor of the rich and powerful that we can't afford to just tinker around the edges. Our fight is for big, structural change.""

-- U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

""This is the time for Democrats to identify exactly what's broken,"" she continued, ""and lay out exactly how we'll fix it.""

Aside from the idea the Warren may be focused too sharply on policy details, others note that many voters may associate Warren with an event that worked against her: Her release of DNA results last October in a bid to prove her claims of Native American ancestry - which won her the derisive nickname ""Pocahontas"" from President Trump.

Warren ended up apologizing to the head of the Cherokee Nation in early February, amid claims that she had exaggerated her ancestry for personal gain. Then just days afterward, reports surfaced that Warren had claimed Native American heritage on a 1986 Texas State Bar registration form.

Finally, Warren - and yes, some other Democrats in the 2020 field -- faces an unfortunate historical fact: Voters seldom back U.S. senators for the presidency, preferring Congress members and governors instead.

When Sen. Barack Obama was elected in 2008, he became just the third sitting senator - behind Warren Harding and John F. Kennedy - to win the White House, Politico reported.

So the obstacles between Warren and the White House would seem to make her potential election as the nation's first female president even more of an achievement.",114,Fox News,"Warren may be too wonkish to connect with voters, some say"
"Turning Point USA founder and Executive Director Charlie Kirk told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump ""recognizes the importance of the culture war"" and that when the president sees his supporters -- as well as constitutional liberties -- under attack, he ""has an obligation to have their backs."" Kirk offered his remarks in a Saturday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Matt Boyle.

""What the president did this week is so historic,"" said Charlie Kirk, ""The signing of an executive order that any institution of higher learning that does not protect the First Amendment rights of their students will -- have their federal funding in jeopardy. This is long overdue.""

Kirk had also noted that while the president may have had a ""great week,"" his successes had not been efficiently reported on by the mainstream media -- a mainstream press that seemed to only be focused on the Mueller report.

""If you think [the left] is going to stop -- you're wrong,"" added Kirk with regards to the Mueller report, ""They're going to say this not adequate enough -- Why? Because he's defending this country from leftist forces. They know that he is the greatest firewall from the left that we've ever had, and they're going to stop, and that's why we have to have his back.""

With regards to the president's executive order, Kirk believes ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" on prompting the president to take action was after conservative activist Hayden Williams was punched in the face at the University of California Berkeley while recruiting students for the school's Turning Point USA student group.

Kirk added that president Trump ""recognizes the importance of the culture war.""

""The president takes this seriously,"" said Kirk, ""and he understands that his movement is actually growing, and that when it's under attack by the left, he has an obligation to have their backs, and God bless this president for engaging in that cultural conversation and backing it up real policies.""

The Turning Point USA founder offered additional remarks on the culture war of today.

As the great Andrew Breitbart used to say, 'politics flows downstream from culture.' Everyone involved in conservative politics should say that every day, because we should be involved in conservative culture, not conservative politics. Politics is just a byproduct of the winners and losers of the culture war. How is culture determined? Through media, family, church, and college campuses. That's how culture is determined. At Turning Point USA, we really hyper-focus on the college campuses -- and something that Breitbart has done such a good job of covering is the suppression of free speech, the suppression of expression on college campuses, where these intellectual tyrants have created these islands of totalitarianism on these college campuses to suppress different opinions.

In another interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily, Kirk had mentioned ""the cartel of the colleges."" Boyle asked him to elaborate on what he meant by that.

It's no different than an inside-out relationship with any crony deal that we see between supposed private industry and government. It's this, really, festered union between big government and ""big universities,"" and so, what you have is a handful of colleges that hide behind their -- phony certification that was given by the Department of Education. They receive ridiculous amounts of money in subsidized student loans, they receive billions of dollars in grants from the federal government, and they continue to raise their tuition rates, they continue to raise their fees, with no recourse whatsoever. Not to mention, they're teaching ideology and they're teaching philosophy that is fundamentally destructive to our country -- Essentially, we're having a generation borrow money they don't have to study things that don't matter to find jobs that don't exist -- it empowers this cartel to be able to advance anti-Western, anti-capitalistic, and anti-conservative values and causes -- Where do you think AOC got all of her ideology from? She got it from the universities.

""This cartel only gets more and more powerful thanks to this ridiculous construct of funding that we have designed,"" added Kirk, ""And so this executive order challenges that cartel. I love seeing that.""

Kirk also noted that the next executive order he would like to see would be one that goes after ""big tech.""

""People don't realize the power that Google has over our country,"" said Kirk, referencing a report on Friday by Breitbart News, which covered new research from psychologist and search engine expert Dr. Robert Epstein that shows biased Google searches had a measurable impact on the 2018 midterm elections in favor of Democrat candidates.",115,Breitbart,Charlie Kirk: Trump Recognizes the Importance of the Culture War

"Google re-affirmed its commitment to New York last week. Its real estate chief, Paul Darrah, told a conference the tech giant plans to double in size over the coming decade.

While it may have cost New York dearly when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and state Sen. Michael Gianaris chased Amazon out of Long Island City last month due to dirty local politics and economic illiteracy, Google is a win for New York.

Remember, companies always have the option to go to another state or even overseas when moronic or infantile politicians destroy the business climate. That said, Google's commitment to New York demonstrates the Big Apple's appeal to big technology companies.

Even our mayor, and of course our governor, understand the value of well-paying jobs and all the good they do to invigorate communities around the city. Not to mention all the glorious tax revenue they generate.

So while the mayor was indeed out to lunch for Amazon Round 1 and the governor got duped by Gianaris and AOC, the Google news is something on which the pols in Manhattan and Albany can build -- a position of strength.

They both should without further delay extend an even more generous olive branch to Jeff Bezos and Amazon and make the tech giant feel that its 25,000 jobs -- with an average pay of $150,000 -- are very welcome here in New York's vibrant and growing technology community, Silicon Alley.

"Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker wants to legalize marijuana in the U.S. and expunge records for federal offenses for use and possession.

Back when I was in college, a close friend of mine developed a bad, paranoid reaction to a strong batch of pot. I will never forget the twisted look of fear on his face. Eventually, he recovered, but it always seemed to me that he was never quite the same, and to this day is quick to be suspicious of people.

When I became a physician, I saw this reaction much more frequently in the ER where I worked, and I became aware that the strains of marijuana people were smoking were becoming stronger.

I saw anxiety and depression and occasionally full-blown psychosis which is characterized by a break from reality with delusional thinking and sometimes hallucinations.

DR. MARC SIEGEL: HEAVY POT SMOKING HAS NOW BEEN LINKED TO THIS STRANGE SYNDROME

The condition brought on by smoking pot is known as cannabis-induced psychosis.

The patients I saw were always agitated, and we treated them with anti-psychotic mediation which generally worked. But sometimes marijuana precipitates a psychotic break in a teen or adult who is prone to schizophrenia, and they never come all the way back to reality despite aggressive treatment.

When a person inhales a marijuana cigarette, he or she sees it in terms of the pleasure potential, altered consciousness, reduction of pain.

When I view it as a physician I see it as containing an active chemical which has health implications. This is the way I view all biochemicals whether they are available over the counter or by prescription only. Marijuana contains a highly potent chemical, tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, which has strong psychological effects.

Genetic factors are important. A variant of the AKT1 gene which effects dopamine in the brain, has been show to put pot smokers more at risk of psychosis.

Though the THC content of Cannabis is variable, it has clearly become much more potent over the years, with many times more THC commonly found now in pot than in the 1970s, when it was commonly less than 2 percent. This change is largely responsible for the increase in paranoia and psychosis among the general population. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987131/

In fact, a large European study across 11 regions and a 12th In Brazil, published in the esteemed British medical journal The Lancet this past week, determined that ""20 percent of new cases of psychotic disorder across all our sites could have been prevented if daily use of cannabis had been abolished.""

In Amsterdam, London, and Paris -- three cities known for high THC marijuana - were found to have a whopping 50 (Amsterdam) and 30 percent (London) of new psychosis cases associated with potent forms of the drug.

In Italy, on the other hand, where pot is restricted to medical and industrial use and a much weaker form is available in Cannabis stores, the rate of new psychotic episodes was found to be less than 10 percent. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30048-3/fulltext

As recreational marijuana becomes legal and is more widely available, higher content THC is becoming more common and so is psychosis. The yearly number of cannabis-induced psychosis cases in Canada is on the rise and has already doubled from 2012 to 2017. https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/mental-health-expert-warns-of-significant-increase-in-cannabis-induced-psychosis-1.4233512

In Colorado, where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012, the prevalence of mental health diagnoses in Emergency Room visits is actually now higher than in those who haven't used marijuana.

These are important medical arguments, not political or legal ones. But public health realities must impact our politics and our laws.

As a practicing internist, I can tell you there are no free lunches when it comes to your health. With stronger recreational pot becoming more widely available all the time (now legal in 10 states, plus the District of Columbia, with more on the way), the risk of psychiatric disorders including worrisome debilitating psychosis, will only grow.",119,Fox News,Dr. Marc Siegel: Pot use and the awful problem of marijuana-induced psychosis (and why it is on the rise)

"JERUSALEM - Rafi Eitan, a legendary Israeli Mossad spy who led the capture of Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, has died. He was 92.

Eitan died Saturday in Tel Aviv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mourned Eitan as a ""hero of the Israeli intelligence services.""

The 1960 operation to capture Eichmann in Argentina and bring him to trial in Jerusalem was perhaps the Mossad's most historic mission. It brought to life the horrors of the Nazi ""Final Solution"" of which Eichmann was the architect.

Eitan was also known for handling Pentagon spy Jonathan Pollard, a U.S intelligence analyst who passed information to Israel in the 1980s, an espionage affair that embarrassed Israel and severely tarnished its relations with the United States.

"Vince Vaughn plays Brad -- sorry, Bradley -- a retired boxer, drug dealer, and substance abuser who goes straight until straight nearly costs him the thing he loves most: his wife (Jennifer Carpenter). A miscarriage and barely tolerable existence on a tow-truck driver's salary (a job he just lost) has undermined the marriage to where she's having an empty sexual affair.

Faced with the intolerable prospect of losing her, Zahler has Bradley make the kind of contradictory decisions that create unforgettable characters. In the most Christian way imaginable he forgives her completely -- and in order to save the marriage he returns to drug running.

Things improve. Everything's cherry. Nice suburban house. Nice cars. The wife's pregnant. The marriage is solid. But Brad's moral code destroys everything when a deal goes sideways. He could walk away. He could go straight home, resume his life. No one would blame him. Instead, his decency forces him to take the kind of action that drops him into the worst possible situation. On top of seven years in prison, the cartel wants him dead, and this is where things get interesting...

The existential threat held over Bradley is an abortionist, is the horror of having his unborn baby girl, a child he already adores, cut into small pieces and mailed to him. In Cell Block 99, the unborn are not a ""fetus"" or a ""clump of cells,"" they are a blessed event and in its own pulpy way, we are forced to come to terms with the fact that abortion truly is murder.

There are even smaller things. Bradley's proud to hang Old Glory over his house and on top of being a cool, stoic badass, he listens to Christian rock.

Finally, there's Bradley's drug dealer-boss Gil (Marc Blucas), an upper middle-class white guy who, upon introduction, matter-of-factly fires off a series of politically incorrect statements about mineral water being ""gay"" and Mexicans always traveling with big families. And yet, Gil doesn't seem to say these things out of a racial malevolence but rather for the pleasure of being an outlaw in a world increasingly ruled by the fascism of political correctness.

In the provincial and increasingly simple-minded world of Hollywood, casual racism is usually the telliest tell of all, its own kind of tired spoiler that predictably informs us that Gil is either a villain or will suffer a comeuppance -- because that's what today's Production Code of Political Correctness requires. In the end, though, Gil steps up, and within the context of the situation, is revealed to be both heroic and loyal.

What a fascinating and surprising choice for Zahler to make.

In most every interview he sits down for, Zahler is pretty much berated over his politics, his non-conformity, his refusal to adhere to the Production Code of Political Correctness. In other words, he's called on the carpet and told to explain himself -- ""Are you now or have you ever been a Republican!"" But Zahler -- God bless him -- refuses to answer. Other then confessing to being an atheist Jew, Zahler will only say his films do not express a point of view, that his only goal is to create something compelling.

I, for one, believe him...

If you want to bleed art into something bland, the fastest route is through ideological conformity. Audiences are pretty smart these days and after two decades of this shit, we're starting to roll our eyes. As tired of these ""tells"" as the rest of us, Zahler has chosen instead to be an artist who surprises, who thrills in ways big and small, who zigs where other artists, either out of fear or a lack of imagination, censor themselves.

Threatening our hero with abortion? A character who says racist shit is not a one-dimensional cross burner? A drug dealing protagonist who's also a devoted family man, Christian, and patriot?

More, please.

Brawl in Cell Block 99 is so perfectly structured and executed, you'd love it even without Zahler's iconoclastic approach towards his characters, but it's that approach that lifts the movie into something surprising, fascinating, and unforgettable.

Dragged Across Concrete? Even more so.

Normally, I don't read reviews until mine is complete. Only the film should inform my perspective. Unsure I'd have access to Dragged (thankfully it was also released on VOD), I took a peek at what others are saying and came away with one overall impression: while most critics gave it a passing grade, many of these so-called progressives who condemned the film as racist exposed their own latent racism with all their talk about Dragged's ""two stars.""

Anyone who watches Dragged and sees only two stars -- Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson -- should ask themselves why they're overlooking the magnificent work of Tory Kittles, a black actor every bit as charismatic as Gibson and Vaughn, a remarkable presence who very nearly steals a movie that mostly belongs to his character, Slim.

But let's back up a bit...

Dragged is not, as its reactionary critics suggest, about white men who fear losing their place in a changing world. A few off-color remarks, a couple of politically incorrect punchlines, and confronting the reality -- yes, the reality -- of what life is like for a white person in a deteriorating neighborhood with a predominantly black population, is not what Dragged is about. I'll get to all of that in a bit, but let's start with what Dragged really is about ... and that's duty to family.

Slim comes home from prison eager to go straight until he discovers his mother is back on drugs and hooking while his handicapped younger brother is locked in a bedroom.

Ridgeman (Gibson) is a 60-year-old cop running out of time to fulfill his patriarchal duty. His ex-cop wife (Laurie Holden) has MS and his daughter is constantly being racially-bullied. He needs money to move before something even worse happens to a little girl on the edge of womanhood.

Lurasetti (Vaughn) is desperately in love with a professional woman way out of his league and looking for every edge to hold on to her, including an engagement ring he couldn't afford even before the suspension.

The suspension is what drives everything.

Lurasetti and Ridgeman are caught on video mildly (at least when compared to Rodney King or what we usually see in movies) roughing up a big-time, Hispanic drug dealer. In a terrific scene, their boss (and Ridgeman's former partner -- played by the great Don Johnson) explains the sorry ways of a sorry world -- a world where ""the entertainment industry we now call the news media needs a villain,"" ""where the handling of every perceived intolerance is done with total intolerance.""

At the same time, though, he doesn't let them off the hook. While Ridgeman undoubtedly would have treated a white dealer the same way and is about to be unfairly crucified as a racist by the Roman circus the news media has become, he still went too far and needs to box the compass of his humanity.

Furious and desperate, Ridgeman decides ""We have the skills and the right to acquire proper compensation.""

Lurasetti is not so sure, but he's loyal to his partner and ""thinking about the kind of future I can offer my girlfriend.""

So the long and oddly fascinating stakeout of a drug dealer begins, the idea being to grab a payday that will get them through the suspension and over the speedbump keeping them from a better life.

Meanwhile, Slim's making similar moves and a collision between these three characters (who have a whole lot more in common than not) twists a knot in your gut that lingers long after the credits roll.

Zahler takes his sweet time with everything, an approach that is the opposite of dull. At two hours and forty minutes and almost no action until the last half-hour, he wants us to get to know his characters, even a bank employee (Jennifer Carpenter) so devoted to her newborn baby she can barely return to work after a three month maternity leave (Imagine that -- a movie that depicts a professional woman desperate to be home with her baby, to be a full-time mother).

And in getting to know these characters, we are invited to spend time with realistic people as they are, and to do so without being lectured about the appropriate opinions to hold of them.

Some critics are screaming homophobia because Ridgeman and Lurasetti comment on how you can no longer tell if a singer is a man or woman, because Ridgeman jokes about Lurasetti's choice of hair product being ""gay."" Gimme a break.

Some critics are angry because Laurie Holden's character admits to feeling guilty, feeling like a racist over what's happening to her daughter and what she fears will happen to her daughter.

Some truly stupid critics are screaming racism because Dragged's arch-villain actually is a virulent racist, but these critics are forgetting that he's the, uh, arch-villain -- you know, the guy Zahler wants us to hiss. But this racist psycho (whose face we never see) is something more, a way for Zahler to distinguish between actual racism and the complicated realities of the human condition.

Like the Ridgemans, I'm a white person who was once forced by economic circumstance to live, work, and go to school for more than two years in a mostly black ghetto. I promise you there is no shortage of black people who will warn a white person against such a thing. You see, it simply doesn't matter that 99.99 percent of your neighbors are good people. All it takes is one bully to single you out for your skin color.

Zahler deserves credit for reflecting this reality, and I dare anyone tut-tutting him over this perfectly valid artistic choice to test this reality.

Zahler's most brilliant choice, though -- a choice that again forces us to see the difference between shit talk and true racism -- is the woman Lurasetti wants to marry: a beautiful, accomplished black woman whose skin color is never mentioned, not even by Ridgeman.

It's also worth mentioning that Zahler isn't paving new ground here, he's merely rewinding his art back to a freer time, to the wonderful era of 70's filmmaking.

The French Connection's Popeye Doyle (Oscar-winner Gene Hackman) and The Stone Killer's Lou Torrey (Charles Bronson), The Taking of Pelham One Two Three's Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), and Across 110th Street's Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) -- I could go on and on -- all make Ridgeman and Lurasetti look woke.

You see, once upon a time, in that glorious era between the original Production Code and today's increasingly oppressive Production Code of Political Correctness, movies weren't afraid to get real, to offer us characters in all their complexities, to reflect them through a humanist prism -- flaws and all. Unlike today, though, this was not done to give insufferably pious storytellers the opportunity to virtue signal; it was done for the sake of art -- to create the most compelling and memorable characters possible.

That kind of artistic integrity has nearly been eradicated by the corporate conformists and fascists who seek to rule American culture, so we must pay attention to Zahler, the rare artist with that integrity and an extraordinary gift for storytelling.

Dragged Across Concrete is utterly hypnotic. I never wanted it to end, and I am going to watch it again today. And then I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and give Zahler's debut, Bone Tomahawk (2015), another look. This time with the attention it deserves.",122,Breitbart,"'Dragged Across Concrete' Review: Courageous, Complicated, Hypnotic"
"BANGKOK -- Thailand's election Sunday is likely to produce a weak unstable government whether it's a civilian or military-backed party that cobbles together a coalition, setting off a new phase of uncertainty in a country that's a U.S. ally in Southeast Asia and one of the world's top tourist destinations.

The election is Thailand's first since its military seized power from an elected government in May 2014. It was the conservative establishment's third major attempt by either military or legal coup to eradicate the influence of Thaksin Shinawatra, a tycoon who made his fortune in telecommunication and upended Thailand's politics with a populist political revolution nearly two decades ago.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who as army chief led the 2014 coup, is hoping to stay in power with a hybrid political system that relies on an appointed Senate and a 20-year national strategic plan to limit the power of political parties not aligned with the military.

""It will be unstable,"" said Prajak Kongkirati, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University.

""Whatever party wins, Prayuth or Thaksin's side, both governments will be weak and unstable,"" he said.

""The government can collapse within a year or a year and a half and we might have a new election quite soon.""

Prayuth's five years as junta leader have been marred by complaints of human rights violations and growing economic inequality. Thailand's ties with the U.S. cooled because of the coup and Prayuth is seeking greater international legitimacy with an election meant to provide the appearance of a return to democracy.

If the junta had one success, it was reinforcing its claim to be protector of Thailand's monarchy, an institution at the heart of Thai society, following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016 after a reign of seven decades and the succession of his son Maha Vajiralongkorn.

Critics say the new military-designed political system is intrinsically unstable because it is not accepted by all sides and will be the beginning of a new round of struggle in Thailand.

The country's prime minister will not be directly elected by its 51 million voters. Instead 750 lawmakers -- 500 from an elected lower house of parliament and 250 from a junta-appointed Senate -- will decide by simple majority. The prime minister does not have to be a member of parliament.

None of the major political parties is likely to have enough elected lawmakers to choose a prime minister and form a government outright. Chaotic outcomes, such as a military favored prime minister chosen with Senate backing that lacks a majority in the parliament, are possible.

Sunday's vote is the latest episode in a sometimes violent political struggle that pits Thaksin's political machine against a conservative establishment led by the ultra-royalist military.

Thaksin swept to power in 2001 with social welfare policies aimed at uplifting the majority rural poor. He lives in exile after he was ousted by a 2006 military coup and accused of abuse of power, corruption and self-enrichment. Some saw him as disrespectful to the monarchy.

The 2014 coup ousted the government that was led by Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was the head of the Thaksin-allied Pheu Thai party at the time.

On Friday, Thaksin hosted a glittering wedding reception in Hong Kong for his youngest daughter, causing a sensation and substantial media and online coverage in Thailand. Guests included the Thai king's sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, who last month made a spectacular but quickly aborted attempt to be a prime ministerial candidate for a small Thaksin-allied party.

Though ostensibly a family affair, the ceremony's timing two days ahead of the election seemed to implicitly say: Don't forget me and my political allies when you go out to vote.

The Pheu Thai party remains broadly popular, especially in the country's north and northeast, home to the majority of voters, and its current leader Sudarat Keyuraphan has urged all Thais to vote, hoping a high turnout will derail Prayuth's plans to stay in power.

""If Pheu Thai does reach the number needed to form a new government, it is unclear how the military leadership would respond,"" said John Ciorciari, a Southeast Asia expert at the University of Michigan.

""Regardless of the election result, it is unlikely to put an end to Thailand's protracted political crisis,"" he said.",123,New York Post,Thailand election could set off new phase of uncertainty for US ally
"Having sailed overseas and seen the atrocities of prewar Nazi Germany, Bill Bailey was angry that the Bremen docked in New York City and set out to pull down its swastika flag (left). The act even drew a demand for apology from Berlin.

In the early 1930s, the Bremen docked regularly on the Hudson River by West 46th Street -- and it was a wonder.

The length of three football fields, the ship was built for luxury. Equipped to host 2,200 passengers and 950 crew, with everything from Turkish baths to a library stocked with the world's finest literature, it was the ideal vacation-ready ocean liner.

The only drawback was the swastika flag flying high aboard its bow.

As the Bremen routinely sailed between Germany and New York, ferrying dignitaries and other wealthy revelers, the horrors of the Nazi regime were leaking out to the world. But too many -- including President Franklin Roosevelt -- chose to ignore or deny the atrocities at that time.

Yet merchant marine Bill Bailey knew the truth, and his protest against the Bremen would make him the first American to take a public stand against Nazi aggression, writes Peter Duffy in the new book, ""The Agitator"" (PublicAffairs), out now.

Bailey was born in 1915 in Jersey City. Living in dire poverty with his mother and five siblings, his drunken lout of a father having run off, he sensed early on that the sea would be his escape.

When he was 14, he visited every pier on the Hudson River until the captain of an old freighter agreed to take him on.

""I stood there lying like hell,"" Bailey later said. ""Told him I was an experienced seaman, been on all seven seas including the Dead Sea. I could do anything on a ship, blah, blah, and I'm 21 years old ... And the guy just said, 'Yeah, OK.' And from then on, I had a job as an ordinary seaman.""

Working on various ships throughout the years, Bailey saw the world for real. In 1932, he ended up in Germany, where he got a rare up-close look, for an American, at the encroaching Nazi horror.

""Bailey was inspired by the fighting spirit of the Communist longshoremen ... and outraged by the brutality of Nazi storm troopers, who were already running all over Germany, punching people out, kicking windows in, attacking Jews,"" Duffy writes.

Those experiences abroad colored Bailey's politics. In 1933, he was 18 and between jobs in New York, when he joined the Marine Workers Industrial Union. He began speaking publicly, recruiting union members among the dockworkers. He also became a member of the Communist Party.

By 1935, the Bremen was a popular attraction in the city. Whenever it docked to discharge passengers from Germany and take on new ones for the return trip, several thousand New Yorkers were allowed on board for a fee to party for one night. At night's end, a horn would blow, urging visitors off the ship.

By then, many New Yorkers were aware of Germany's atrocities, and the Bremen was increasingly met with thousands of protestors who felt Hitler's prized vessel should not be welcomed to our shores, much less be used to dine and dance. As authorities continued to allow it to dock, Bailey and his fellow party members decided to do something to ""wake this goddamn United States up,"" Bailey later wrote.

With the Bremen due in New York again on July 26, 1935, the leaders of Bailey's Communist Party branch came up with a plan. As protests were already expected on the street below, several dozen party members -- male and female -- would dress in their finest eveningwear and board the boat like revelers. When the horn blasted, telling non-passengers to leave the boat, several of the women would handcuff themselves to the ship's mast and create a distraction. Then, the men would seize the swastika flag and march it off the boat to the party chairman, who would set fire to it in the street.

At first, the role of capturing the flag fell to one of the party's longest-serving members, 36-year-old Merchant Marine Edward Drolette.

But Drolette ""couldn't keep his mouth shut,"" and the plan got leaked to the NYPD. When Drolette boarded the Bremen sometime after 10:30 p.m., police were on his tail. By that point, the ship was in full-on party mode, with passengers including Henry S. Morgan, grandson of J.P. Morgan and future founder of Morgan Stanley, and William Donner Roosevelt, ""the 2-year-old grandson of the president of the United States.""

Meanwhile, Bailey and two fellow Communists, Mac Blair and Paddy Gavin, wandered the deck toward the flag, ""occasionally barking out a 'Sieg Heil' for appearance's sake.""

By 11:15 p.m., the NYPD notified the Bremen's owners that infiltrators had breached their security, and the ship's commander ""issued an order seeking the removal of all visitors."" But the 4,800 people on board made that impossible while also blocking Drolette's starboard path to the flag.

So the infiltrators changed their plan, and agreed that Bailey, Blair and Gavin would capture the flag from port side instead.

At 11:45 p.m., the ship's horn blew, encouraging visitors to leave. In the melee, the handcuff plan was abandoned, but one lone Communist protestor marched toward a restricted portion of the deck.

When a Bremen crew member barked a rebuke, the rebel wound up his fist and ""lobbed a haymaker that knocked the man flat on his back.""

Chaos took hold, and Blair and Bailey seized their moment.

Bailey slipped past the authorities, but Blair felt a hand on his neck. Seeing it belonged to a Nazi crew member, he turned and stabbed him in the face with a fountain pen. Bailey paused to help, but Blair urged him on.

""Keep going!"" he yelled. ""Get up there!""

Leaping aboard the ship's gunwale with police nightsticks swinging around him, Bailey began to climb a flimsy ladder.

With ""a roar of triumph"" rising around him from the thousands of protestors on the street, Bailey reached for his target.

""Feeling 'almost stage fright,' Bailey took a moment to glance down,"" Duffy writes. ""Without a rail to brace himself, he understood that the slightest misstep would put him in the drink. He tugged at the swastika, which ripped along the top seam."" But he couldn't get the bottom half of the flag to move.

As he struggled, one of his comrades pulled out a switchblade and cut the rope holding the flag. Suddenly the swastika fell loose and was now fully in Bailey's hands.

It was now or never.

""Bill Bailey hurled Hitler's treasure into the Hudson River,"" Duffy writes. ""The swastika came sliding down, disappeared a moment, ballooned up and went skimming through the air dropping into the water below.""

Said Bailey later of his triumph: ""It was a moment worth everything .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. just to see that sonofabitch in the water and the Germans going stark mad! And the crowd on the dock stark mad with delight.""

'It was a moment worth everything .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. just to see that sonofabitch in the water and the Germans going stark mad!'

Afterwards, a State Department spokesperson issued an apology to Germany before one was even requested, saying, ""It is unfortunate that two or three persons should mistreat the flag of any nation with which the United States is at peace.""

Bailey, Blair, Drolette and three of their co-conspirators were arrested and dubbed ""The Bremen Six"" in the press, which at the time firmly took the side of the Nazis. They were charged with felonious assault on a police officer and intent to breach the peace, but after long, high-profile trials, all six were acquitted.

The Bremen, meanwhile, continued its New York to Germany route, with a new swastika flag flying high until September 1939, when Great Britain declared war on Germany and it returned home for good. The ship was destroyed in an attack by the British Royal Air Force and sold off for scrap metal.

In the postwar years, Bailey was destroyed as well, getting caught in the Red Scare of the time, blacklisted and kicked out of the Marine Workers union for being a Communist in 1950. Six years later, Bailey quit the Communist Party himself, because he realized that Stalin was a ""paranoid, sick SOB.""

He spent the next few decades as a longshoreman and activist in San Francisco where he gave radical walking tours of the city and reemerged as a father figure to other liberal organizers. Robert De Niro even relied on Bailey's experience on the blacklist for his 1991 film ""Guilty by Suspicion,"" in which the old seaman had a walk-on role as a security guard.

Bailey suffered from a lung condition caused by asbestos exposure from his work on the high seas. But even that didn't dim his passion until his death in 1995 at 84.

""To witness an injustice and do nothing,"" he once said. ""That is the biggest crime.""",124,New York Post,How one man launched a mutiny on a Nazi ship in New York City
"JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was glowing as he stepped up to a podium in the backyard of his Jerusalem home to welcome U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to a holiday dinner.

Less than an hour earlier, President Donald Trump had surprised the world by announcing that the U.S. would reverse policy and recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria after the Six-Day War of 1967.

Senior U.S. and Israeli officials had been told privately that such an announcement was in the works, but that it wouldn't come until Netanyahu visited Washington next week.

Instead, Trump abruptly tweeted the news, delaying the Thursday dinner celebrating the Jewish holiday of Purim so Netanyahu could call the president to thank him.

""We have a miracle of Purim,"" Netanyahu said, beaming broadly at his wife, Sarah, the secretary of state and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, as they sat outside on a chilly evening. ""President Trump has just made history.""

The effusive praise of Trump by Netanyahu is characteristic of their mutually beneficial relationship, more pronounced than perhaps any previous alliance between leaders of the two countries. The surprise recognition of the Golan was just the most recent of many examples.

""The Trump-Netanyahu relationship has no precedent,"" said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul-general in New York. ""They see eye to eye.""

Their unusual connection began as soon as Trump took office, when Netanyahu was among the first foreign leaders to visit the White House. Trump appreciates the praise Netanyahu has lavished upon him -- compared with the more restrained reaction from other foreign leaders. And boosting Israel plays well with his political base, which is heavy with conservative Christians who see it as a top priority. Trump has deputized son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose family has longstanding personal ties to Netanyahu, to work on a Middle East peace plan, though details of that strategy remain unclear.

The value of the Golan announcement for Netanyahu appeared obvious at the backyard podium at the Purim dinner. He exuded a confidence that belied whatever concerns he may have about a series of corruption scandals and looming possible criminal charges that have engulfed him in recent months and turned Israel's April 9 election into an unexpectedly close race between him and a popular former military chief. Netanyahu has denied all charges.

""For those on the fence, it will enhance his standing for sure,"" said Eytan Gilboa, professor of politics at Bar-Ilan University. ""The Golan Heights recognition, warm White House reception, personal dinner with Trump. It will both divert attention away from his pressing domestic concerns and make him appear as a great world leader.""

Their relationship will be on display again this coming week. Netanyahu will be in Washington for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee annual conference and will be hosted at the White House for a meeting and a dinner - his third trip there since Trump took over.

Even before the Golan move, Trump has repeatedly and radically altered U.S. policies related to Israel, siding with Netanyahu at the expense of the Palestinians and to the dismay of longtime U.S. allies in Europe and others.

He recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians, closed their representative office in Washington, and ended the decades-long practice of opposing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank in what would be the core of a future Palestinian state.

Trump also withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Netanyahu had fiercely opposed, and re-imposed stringent new sanctions on the country that Israel regards as an existential threat. And he pulled the U.S. out of several U.N. organizations, the U.N. Human Rights Council and UNESCO, citing anti-Israel bias in their agendas.

But their association has not helped Trump win over Jewish American voters, and has complicated Netanyahu's relationship with the American Jewish community, who vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Many have expressed dismay over Netanyahu's close ties with the president.

And Trump has used his Israel policies to needle his Democratic opponents. He routinely cites his support of Israel, not to mention his friendship with Netanyahu, as proof that critics are wrong when they say he fails to denounce white nationalism or anti-Semitism. And, he has used it as a cudgel to bash Democrats who are not in lockstep with his policies.

""The Democrats have very much proven to be anti-Israel,"" Trump said Friday. ""There's no question about that. And it's a disgrace. I mean, I don't know what's happened to them but they are totally anti-Israel. Frankly, I think they're anti-Jewish.""

A strong majority of American Jews supported Democrats in the midterms and in 2016, but the party is divided over the U.S.-Israeli relationship. That came to a head last month, when freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, insinuated that lobbyists with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, were paying lawmakers to support Israel, a remark that drew bipartisan criticism.

Nearly all of the declared 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke and Kamala Harris, have said they won't attend the AIPAC conference this year, though other prominent party officials will be there.

Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel organization, said the Trump-Netanyahu alliance has tested the committee's traditional commitment to bipartisanship. J Street has encouraged Democrats who attend the upcoming AIPAC conference to use the stage to denounce Netanyahu's hardline policies.

""When your role as an organization is to support those in power, you end up getting dragged along,"" he said.

The Cannon Rotunda is in the Cannon House Office Building, named after the late House Speaker Joe Cannon (R-IL). The Russell Rotunda is in the Russell Senate Office Building, the namesake of Sen.

Statues of late Congressional figures, American presidents and other persons of historical importance saturate the Capitol complex. President Ronald Reagan and Martin Luther King Jr. in the Capitol Rotunda. Rosa Parks and Thomas Edison in Statuary Hall. Sakakawea and Helen Keller in the Capitol Visitor's Center.

I recently unearthed two dusty CD's of public radio stories I did about Congress between 2004 and 2006. What struck me about these aural time capsules was how many lawmakers spoke from the grave in the reports:

Sens. Ted Stevens (R-AK), George Voinovich (R-OH), Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Craig Thomas (R-WY), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), along with Reps. John Dingell (D-MI), Steven LaTourette (R-OH), Vern Ehlers (R-MI), Leonard Boswell (D-IA) and Julia Carson (D-IN).

We talk about the departed all the time.

Senators invoke the ""Byrd Rule"" when discussing the complex, budget reconciliation process, named after the late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-WV). The ""Byrd Rule"" bars provisions attached a budget reconciliation measure which would add significantly to the deficit. Joe Cannon has come up a lot of late. Cannon faced a rebellion from lawmakers after he ran the House with an iron fist. The creation of the ""motion to recommit"" or ""MTR"" grew out of that uprising. An MTR is the last chance for the minority party to kill or alter legislation on the floor. Some Democrats want to change the MTR as Republicans have recently prevailed on two MTR's on the floor, against the wishes of most Democrats.

DIRECTOR JUDD APATOW SLAMS DONALD TRUMP'S 'CULT-LIKE' FOLLOWERS OVER JOHN MCCAIN JABS

We bring this all up because President Trump is again railing about the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).

McCain has seemingly crept under the President's skin. And so Mr. Trump is unloading broadsides against the late senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee. President Trump has said he ""never liked McCain,"" rekindling an old feud with the Arizona Republican. The President lashed out at McCain for not supporting a Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. As a result, a host of lawmakers from both sides are now rallying to the defense of McCain, who laid in state in the Capitol Rotunda late last summer.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wants to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after McCain.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is one of President Trump's biggest backers and perhaps McCain's most loyal colleague. But Graham says he doesn't ""like it"" when the President attacks his late friend.

TRUMP SAYS JOHN MCCAIN 'WAS HORRIBLE, WHAT HE DID WITH REPEAL AND REPLACE'

In an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) called Mr. Trump's onslaught about McCain ""deplorable"" and ""damaging.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called McCain ""a rare patriot and genuine American hero"" via Twitter. Yet some criticized McConnell for only defending McCain and not denouncing Mr. Trump's disparagements.

The President's aggressive condemnations of McCain even compelled the McCain Institute for International Leadership, associated with Arizona State University, to publish a news release titled ""The Facts About John McCain."" The missive talked about McCain's military service, time as a prisoner of war and included a lengthy justification about the senator's position on health care.

""John McCain opposed Obamacare and fully supported 'repeal and replace,'"" punched back the release. ""John McCain voted against the bill presented to the U.S. Senate - his famous 'thumbs down' - because it was 'repeal,' without 'replace.'""

In an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, President Trump reiterated that he is ""not a fan"" of McCain, even suggesting that the furor over McCain is the press's fault.

""You people bring it up,"" said the President.

Yet it was President Trump who again began tearing into McCain after a period of dormancy.

""What he did to the Republican party and to the nation, the sick people who could have had great health care... Not good,"" said Mr. Trump.

It's not strange to hear about deceased lawmakers in Washington. So many of them are etched into the day-to-day patter of Capitol Hill that most who utter their names probably don't even know much about the name of a room or a building they're talking about. Rayburn. Dirksen. LBJ. And it may not be long until something in the Senate is named after John McCain. It's as though these figures are kind of still living, influencing events.

There's a thing in Star Wars about the dead. On multiple occasions, those who have passed on sometimes return as a ""Force ghost."" They speak to the living and stage-manage events from the grave.

After Darth Vader cut down Obi-Wan Kenobi in a lightsaber duel, the latter returned via metempsychosis as a Force Ghost. Kenobi periodically re-emerges, instructing Luke Skywalker from the great beyond.

Death in Congress is a little bit like what happens in Star Wars.

People still talk about ""Sarbanes-Oxley,"" a major piece of consumer and financial regulation legislation. It's named after former Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) and the late Rep. Mike Oxley (R-OH) who crafted the measure. Every college student in the country knows about ""Pell Grants,"" named after the late Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-RI). Americans have long held tax-free ""Roth IRA's,"" engineered by the late Sen. William Roth (R-DE). The ""Hyde Amendment"" is a provision sponsored by the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL) prohibiting the use of federal dollars for abortions. There is even ""McCain-Feingold."" McCain teamed up with former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) to regulate campaign financing.

Legislation and Congressional infrastructure are usually where we continue to hear from former leaders, impacting the daily lives of Americans, long after they died. President Trump's fixation with McCain is different. Mr. Trump routinely changes the ground rules in politics.

"Lori Loughlin's daughter reportedly furious at parents for ruining her career by pushing college

A Fox News analysis of political donations by the 50 individuals charged in the college admissions scandal shows that alleged corruption appears to know no political ideology.

Some of the alleged scammers made occasional contributions to individual candidates. Others, though, like Robert Flaxman, a real estate magnate who is charged in the scandal, gave small fortunes to both Republican and Democratic campaigns.

In 2012, Flaxman gave $50,000 to the Romney Victory Fund in support of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Four years later, in 2016, the 62-year-old founder of Crown Realty and Development supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton with a donation of the same amount to the Hillary Victory Fund.

UCLA SOCCER COACH STEPS DOWN AMID COLLEGE ADMISSION SCANDAL BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS

Felicity Huffman, a star of the show Desperate Housewives, has consistently donated to Democratic campaigns. Since 2003, she's given over $11,000, according to Political Money Line and FEC records.

Her donation history shows a notable level of support for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) over the past couple of years. Starting in 2016, Huffman gave the Kamala Harris for Senate organization over $2,000 in contributions.

While Huffman's donations are indicative of her politics, others ensnared in the scandal gave tens of thousands of dollars to both Democrat and Republican candidates.

FEC records show that Flaxman began donating in 2007 with a bevy of contributions to Republican campaigns, including $19,600 to support John McCain. That year, he also gave $10,000 to the California Republican Party.

Most of Flaxman's donations are small dollar amounts made to individual campaigns in 2016, but several top $2,000 - including $30,800 he gave to the Republican National Committee in 2012.

In 2016, he made at least 43 contributions to various candidates and party organizations. Again, his donations were bipartisan. The real estate magnate gave $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's campaign for president and $33,400 to the Democratic National Convention. He also donated $2,700 to the Indiana Republican State Committee and the same amount to the campaign of Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican.

Others had similarly bipartisan patterns of political donations. Manuel Henriquez, the founder of Hercules Capital who has been charged in the scandal, has given thousands of dollars to Democrat and Republican causes. In 2017, he donated $2,000 to Rep. Steve Stivers (R-OH) and in 2012 he gave $10,000 to the Obama Victory Fund.

Outside of his donation to Stivers, Henriquez, who began donating between 2003 and 2004, has largely supported Democratic causes. In 2004, he made a pair of $5,000 donations to the Democratic National Committee.

The reasons for bipartisan donations are myriad, according to Brendan Quinn, a spokesperson at the Center for Responsive Politics. He said a donor supporting both Democrat and Republican candidates could be a simple as them having a personal connection or preference for the candidates.

Although Quinn couldn't speak to the specific motivations of the Flaxman and others, he said it's not uncommon for business owners and others to curry political favor with their donations.

A notable presence in the records of many of the donors is ActBlue, a PAC that aims to ""democratize power and help small-dollar donors make their voices heard,"" according to its website. Since its founding in 2004, the organization has raised more than $1 billion for Democratic candidates.

"Unmasking the Administrative State: The Crisis of American Politics in the Twenty-First Century, by John Marini (Encounter, 332 pp., $27.99)

The proper purpose of political science is education for government. Since in America any citizen of age can be authorized by an election or an appointment to exercise an office and discharge its powers, it is proper and necessary to educate everyone about the character of American politics -- the way the Constitution is intended to work and the purposes it serves, as established in the Declaration.

That is the intention of John Marini in his new book, Unmasking the Administrative State, the culmination of four decades of study on the unconstitutionality of the administrative state, the dangers it poses to self-government, and its mounting crisis, culminating in the election of Donald Trump. Marini teaches political science at University of Nevada, Reno, and is a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute. Along with the book's editor, Ken Masugi, Marini was a special assistant to Justice Clarence Thomas when he ran the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Reagan administration. This brings us to the first practical effect of Marini's teaching -- Justice Thomas repeatedly credited them as his first teachers on the natural-rights doctrine of the Founding. Consequently, their Straussian (through Harry Jaffa) theory of the Founding now has a hearing at the Supreme Court.

More broadly, Marini is part of the group of students of Leo Strauss who have become the most dedicated opponents of progressivism, at least within political science. The Claremont Institute and Hillsdale College are the most famous centers of this opposition now but by no means the only ones. In a sense, as these scholars often cite the example of Donald Trump as an outsider attacking the establishment in Washington, they themselves are outsiders who have mounted a theoretical attack on the post-FDR consensus, but in academia.

Marini has two aims. First, to retell the history of American political ideas in the 20th century, in order to offer an alternative to the institutional progressive consensus. Second, to show the practical problems of the progressives' administrative state and then make the theoretical case against it. Progress as a political project is Marini's enemy, alongside its underlying theory, historicism, according to which we have achieved, throughout history, radical progress in thinking and in understanding humanity. The historicist assumption is that people today are morally and intellectually superior to people in previous generations, especially to the Founders under whose arrangements we nevertheless live for the most part. Any respect for the Constitution presupposes that we are not wiser than the Founders.

These, accordingly, are the book's three parts, each introduced by Masugi: ""The Triumph of the Administrative State over the Constitution,"" ""The Administrative State in Practice,"" and ""Theory and History of the Administrative State."" This book is Marini's most comprehensive statement on the problem the administrative state poses to our tradition of self-government. Since he is the most theoretically coherent opponent of the administrative state, the book is one of the important documents of our constitutional crisis, especially now that our daily political scandals often involve conflicts regarding the authorities of the various branches of government and the agencies within them.

The book is timely for reasons that go beyond any particular scandal. Through his examination of the various conflicts in our politics, Marini reveals the constitutional justification of what we now call populism. His argument is that the progressive political project amounts to regime change -- that this was stated clearly an hundred years ago when the originators of Progress first came to prominence and that it is now easily seen in the actions of the alphabet-soup government agencies created since the 1970s. Marini sees our political crisis as a conflict between two incompatible regimes: The old regime of the Constitution, with all the changes made to it since the end of the 18th century, and the new regime installed by Progressives, which culminates in the administrative state, or the rule of experts who are legitimated by their expertise rather than the consent of the governed.

Since President Trump was elected, quite a number of bestsellers have been written to defend or to damn the man, but we have very little work that makes a serious attempt to clarify the political issues involved in our new partisan conflict. Marini's book is such an attempt. Only the concluding chapter deals with the 2016 election and its consequences, but the whole of the book does the work needed to articulate what's involved in our populist politics, by showing how Washington ended up centralizing not just politics but also administration and therefore becoming the most important place in America for economics as well as politics and any number of other domains. Establishing the theoretical coherence of the progressive project we call the administrative state finally clarifies what it is that people opposed to the ""establishment"" or ""the swamp"" or ""Washington"" or ""elites"" actually oppose and offers a political ground for such an opposition in the Constitution.

It might seem odd to look to an avuncular professor of political philosophy to provide the coherence that populist politics needs but cannot supply for itself, but at least in America this makes sense, since the teachings of political philosophy, starting with natural rights, go back further than the Founding itself. What's far more strange than this is the rarity of such efforts -- Marini is one of a small number of writers on politics who have made it their work to question the legitimacy of rule by experts and to expose it as an attack on the constitutional system of the separation of powers, balances and checks, and accountability to the electorate.

Conservatives could therefore learn from this book how to hold on to conservative principles and at the same time engage in politics in a populist time. Marini's argument about our times, about what's urgent, should be very attractive to populists and perhaps palatable to those who, though they are not progressives, cannot commit to populism. He points out that now we have achieved unwittingly something no previous crisis managed to accomplish. We have a clear opposition between populism and Progress. The very accumulation of power in Washington has made it the favorite target of political ire. Our moment may prove decisive therefore. The American people can now decide between the Founders' Constitution and the progressive -- or ""living"" -- Constitution.

This is not to say that Trump is an apostle of the Constitution or the true heir of the Founders, as Lincoln was. Nor that opposition to Progress is bound to be the majority opinion in America and at the same time the basis for a strong majority coalition. Far from it. Neither the champion whom such a cause might need nor the popular support for it are guaranteed. It is perfectly possible, after all, that even people who read this book and agree with Marini's argument throughout conclude nevertheless that Progress inevitably wins, even if they think it corrupt. Progressives themselves might agree with everything in the historical and theoretical argument and walk away concluding that Progress is right, the Founders were wrong, and Americans need to recommit to FDR's vision or Obama's.

This book brings clarity about our politics and can help clarify our partisanship. It does not, however, offer any prediction as to the likely outcome of our present discontent, or any weapons with which to determine the outcome of the war of ideas. Chance and the American people will decide these matters in 2020 and afterward. Political science, even done well, can contribute only so much.

Now, our partisan conflict has taken its typical American form, populists versus elites. And Progress once again has failed either to secure control of America or to persuade the people that they are very happy and should be grateful to Washington, or at least content in the lives administered by Washington. So an alternative based on natural rights and common sense can oppose the rule of experts, bureaucrats, and punitive, sanctimonious elites. The doctrine of Progress is reducible to rational control of human affairs, organized through the federal government, especially the non-elected parts, whether federal courts or executive agencies (which are under very limited control by the president). In betting on the future and on rational control, progressives are vulnerable to being proven wrong by being defeated politically. We might have progressives with us always, but the authority of the power they've built into the administrative state could be destroyed quickly. Chance, simple bad luck, itself is helpful to the opponents of progressives, if we only take our chances and spread the good news that the administrative state is illegitimate and has failed. Experts are not smart enough to rule America.

It is Marini's special achievement to have married populism and a defense of the Constitution in terms of natural rights. The founder of National Review, William F. Buckley Jr., expressed this preference for populism over unaccountable elites when he quipped that he'd rather be governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than by the faculty of Harvard. Buckley was a friend of Harry Jaffa, Marini's teacher, from whom he, like many others, learned about the decisive importance of the doctrine of natural rights in American politics.

Political science and populism ordinarily have very little in common, but they do now have a crucial alliance. The rule of experts in Washington is implausible, if not impossible, without the rule of experts in academia, not merely because all the jobbers have to be trained somewhere but because their authority depends on their control of academia, which in turn depends on their form of political science. It is already at that level that contempt for human experience, common sense, and ultimately the consent of the governed is decided. The progressive attempt to reduce politics to administration is also an attempt to impose a claim to scientific authority that precludes the political disagreement that politics and political science both need in order to give any serious account of justice, the common good, and our dignity. The alternative to political disagreement is some form of technological rule -- administration involves robots and algorithms more and more -- that would allow for no theoretical justification for the preference of human judgment.

Marini presents a non-progressive, non-historicist history of American politics in the 20th century and shows that the older political science of the Federalist and the sources in political philosophy that formed the Founders can hold their own against progressives in argument. He also shines the light of political philosophy on politics and government in a way that should inspire readers to take politics more seriously and defend it against administration. We will need political elites if we are going to oppose Progress, and they will need an education in political philosophy and American history. May Marini's book be the beginning of a generational effort to restore consent of the governed to its rightful prominent position in American politics and to restore natural rights to their old dignity in American political thought.",129,nationalreview.com,Making the Case for Populism over Progressivism
"David Sloan Wilson's new book argues that evolutionary biology can inform society and politics.

In This View of Life: Completing the Darwinian Revolution, evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson continues the project of scientific imperialism that has defined much of the latter part of his career. This View of Life takes as given that humans are shaped by our evolutionary past, and proceeds to show how general principles derived from the discipline can be applied to policy decisions and social problems, guiding our species-wide goals to further our flourishing. Wilson aims to break evolution out of its biological box, offering it as a universal framework for understanding and shaping human phenomena.

This is an ambitious program. But first one has to address the historical elephant in the room: the misapplication of evolutionary principles. The prosecution argues that evolution stands of accused of aiding and abetting the abominations that culminated in Nazi Germany. After the defeat of Hitler's regime, evolutionary theory retreated into the redoubt of biology, concerning itself with natural history, laboratory experiments, and abstruse mathematical models. And there it should stay, argue its critics, lest we repeat the mistakes of the past.

David Sloan Wilson rejects this argument in totality. He notes that the opprobrium hurled at evolution's application to social problems draws from Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought. Hofstadter was a man of left-wing commitments writing in 1944, as the war against Hitler's regime was still a live concern. His was not a dispassionate scholarly analysis. He aimed to produce something which could be deployed in the fight against ""racism, nationalism, or competitive strife.""

This View of Life highlights how men as diverse as Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Francis Galton, and Thomas Malthus were not united in their views, nor were they the cruel anti-humanitarians that their detractors portray them as (Hitler's own views were scientifically inchoate at best, and ignorant at worst). Wilson's arguments are familiar to libertarians in particular, many of whom have long argued that Hofstadter misrepresented classical liberals.

The argument for the defense that one encounters in This View of Life may not entirely convince, at least in the chapter-length treatment Wilson provides. The great evolutionary geneticist R. A. Fisher's central work, Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, contains a long exposition of eugenicist thought as applied to humanity. To not put too fine a point on this, contemporary readers invariably find this section quite offensive. And yet Fisher himself was a complicated figure, a patriotic British Tory conservative and Anglican Christian. The past was truly a different age.

Most of This View of Life, though, presents a forward-looking positive vision, not a backward-looking apologia. Wilson argues cogently that humanity, both in its biology and its culture, is a product of evolution. The central pillars of his narrative are the ""four major questions"" elucidated by the ethologist Niko Tinbergen in the 20th century as essential aspects of any evolutionary analysis. First, what is the function of a trait? Second, what is the history of the trait over many generations? Third, what is the physical mechanism of the trait? Finally, how does the trait develop during the history of the particular organism?

At this point you may wonder how Wilson applies these questions outside of biology, in religion for example, thereby completing the Darwinian revolution. Though This View of Life touches upon religion, it is in an earlier book, Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society, that he elaborates in detail how religious belief systems are evolutionarily shaped cultural phenomena.

Consider the trait of missionary activity. The function of the trait is to increase the flock and bear witness to the message of salvation. In regards to its history, the earliest records of missions go back to Buddhism, many centuries before Christ, during the reign of the Emperor Ashoka. The trait seems to have become common in many Roman ""mystery religions,"" culminating with Christianity, and later adopted by Islam, evolving over time in vigor and centrality to various faiths. The mechanism is straightforward. Believers leave their homelands and propagate their views. Finally, the nature of missionary activity has changed in many religions over time, as aims and methods have been refined - changes that develop through selection.

A specific religion can be thought of as a cultural organism. Consider the Western Christian tradition - the Roman Catholic Church and the eruption of the Reformation. It made forays into organized missionary work under Gregory the Great in the sixth century a.d., but it truly refined the process in the 16th and 17th centuries with the emergence of orders such as Jesuits - missionary arms of the Church tasked with countering the spread of Protestantism - taking the faith across the oceans to new lands.

The application of evolutionary principles to religion illustrates that This View of Life is not wedded to genetics. Genetics revolutionized our understanding of evolution in the 20th century, but in our time Wilson wants to push evolution beyond its genetic basis. All that evolution requires is inheritance of characteristics. This vision is grounded strongly on a ""multi-level"" understanding of organismic complexity, extending ideas Wilson developed in the early part of his career. In the biological context, that means viewing organisms from their simplest level - that of the gene - up to the individual, above that to kin groups, and then to large entities such as tribes and nations. And once you extend your analysis to large groups, cultural processes become much more powerful than biological ones.

Due to its ambition, This View of Life takes aim at the incumbent imperium of applied social science: economics. Wilson has no time for the utilitarian individualism of neoclassical economics and its fixation on static equilibria. He rejects Homo economicus as intellectually impoverished, with thin insights not conducive to fostering human flourishing. Just as with the refutation of the arguments popularized by Hofstadter, skeptics may raise their eyebrows at the broad-brush dismissal of economics in Wilson's narrative, but the thing to focus on is the alternative vision he presents. You can set This View of Life next to Tim Harford's The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World with no guilt.

It is simply a fact that humans are fundamentally social animals. Though the liberal vision emphasizes the centrality of the individual in terms of worth, our evolutionary history suggests that human uniqueness lies in our incredible sociality and cultural creativity. Individual human beings exist, but so do a wide range of social organizations. Consider the various city-states of ancient Greece, with their myriad political systems, or the communes of the Burned-over District of upstate New York in the 19th century after the Second Great Awakening. Religions, civic associations, and polities: These are all unique and ubiquitous to our species.

Evolution on the individual level favors selfishness, as one might see in Homo economicus. Greed is, on the one level, good. But Wilson shows that in the broader context of animal breeding, maximizing the most ""fit"" lineages results in lower overall productivity, as rapacious individuals tear down the social fabrics on which they rely to exist. It is often the case that selection for groups of cooperative organisms, who may on an individual level be less impressive, results in greater yield. Evolution is more than the sum of its parts.

And so it is with human societies, as the total drive toward selfishness leads to a war of all against all, and social collapse. Homo economicus may win against other members of their own tribe, but their tribe always loses to Homo sapiens, which is a much less rapacious creature. This View of Life presents a progressive vision of human complexity increasing over the eons, as bands becomes clans, and clans become tribes, and tribes become nations. The ultimate level of organization Wilson envisions is a global one.

But here he does not imagine a centralized, top-down leviathan. Rather, he posits iterative experimentation as an essential feature of evolutionary systems, which evolve and change over time. They depend not on eternal equilibriums, but on contemporary responses to current conditions. Wilson inveighs against laissez-faire, but does not offer up as a utopian uniform alternative a centralized command economy. Evolution is not top-down design, as might apply to a physical system, but bottom-up adaptation and experimentation, as is the norm in biological systems. Small businesses, civic associations, localities, and nonprofits will likely drive social change and advancement on a global scale in the view promulgated in Wilson's narrative. They incentivize innovation and promote what works.

This View of Life begins with a discussion of the ideas of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, an evolutionary biologist, Jesuit priest, and philosopher, whose impact in the 20th century has been largely forgotten in the 21st century. It concludes with a frank admission that Wilson is aspiring to the same aim of de Chardin's work in The Phenomenon of Man, which argued that humanity is pushing forward the project of increased social complexity so that there will evolve a supreme-consciousness, the ""Omega Point."" In a broad sense Wilson too aspires to the Omega Point. He states that the ""evolutionary worldview"" in This View of Life is an ethic, while ""evolutionary theory"" is simply a description. This is a large step for a scientist - so large that it changes his work from that of a scientist to that of a pundit.

Most evolutionary biologists would no doubt feel The Phenomenon of Man is a bizarre work. Richard Dawkins has praised sharp critiques of The Phenomenon of Man. In his scientific work Dawkins has suggested that humanity is good not in spite of its nature, but because of it. Similarly, many scientists will look askance at the grand claims Wilson promotes in This View of Life, as he mixes ""is"" and ""ought,"" jumping from a positive description of reality to normative prescriptions for human happiness and well-being.

In contrast, religious conservatives may see Wilson's visions as materialistic and hubristic. Its ultimate evolutionary basis, and nearly messianic aims, ensure that This View of Life will alarm many traditionalists.

The fact is, one can argue that Wilson's This View of Life is all of these things, and that the author believes in the importance of his vision to such an extent that he is not particularly concerned with causing alarm. Wilson begins the book as an evolutionary biologist, describing the facts as they are. He ends it like de Chardin, an evolutionary priest, preaching to the unconverted the good news at hand.",130,nationalreview.com,Finishing What Darwin Began | National Review
"The politics and the fallout from the completion of the Mueller report

Those who spent the last two years pushing the narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election need to be held accountable, the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued Friday.

Earlier in the day, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in its report on the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice and it was announced that no new indictments would be forthcoming.

During Friday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" Hemingway -- along with Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason -- weighed in on the breaking news that reverberated throughout Washington.

MUELLER SUBMITS LONG-AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

Hemingway began by noting that the ""Russia narrative"" predates the Mueller probe, having begun circulating during the 2016 election after the creation of the infamous Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier, which pushed the theory that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was a ""Russian agent.""

""We have, for the last three years ... frequently [witnessed] hysteria about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election,"" Hemingway told the panel. ""The fact [is] that there are no more indictments coming and the fact [is] that all of the indictments that we've seen thus far have been for process crimes or things unrelated to what we were told by so many people in the media was 'treasonous collusion' to steal the 2016 election.""

""If there is nothing there that matches what we've heard from the media for many years, there needs to be a reckoning and the people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government who were not critical and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable,"" she added.

Mason told the panel that there's likely ""some relief"" in the White House, particularly from Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser. And while he insisted it was ""too early"" to draw major conclusions, he later added that those who attacked Mueller's credibility throughout his investigation will have to walk back their hostility if he concludes that there was no collusion, including President Trump.

Meanwhile, Continetti suggested that the Mueller report could be the ""greatest anticlimax in American history,"" and that the entire investigation could be ""for nothing"" because it was ""an investigation without a crime."" He did, however, insist that the ""battle will continue"" as the White House will fight Congress on transparency of the Mueller findings.",131,Fox News,'There needs to be a reckoning' for those who spread Russia collusion narrative: Mollie Hemingway
"BANGKOK - Thailand will hold its first general election Sunday since the military ousted the elected government in a coup nearly five years ago.

Thailand has a long history of cycling through elected governments that are then ousted by the army, which in time allows fresh elections.

Here's a look the key political events since Thailand's last general election.

_____

July 3, 2011: The Pheu Thai Party led by Yingluck Shinawatra, the sister of fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, wins a landslide majority in the general election. Thaksin was ousted by a 2006 military coup and fled Thailand in 2008 to avoid serving a prison term for a conflict of interest conviction.

Aug. 5, 2011: The House of Representatives elects Yingluck to become Thailand's first female prime minister.

_____

June 2012: Yingluck's ruling party pushes legislation to promote national reconciliation with the stated goal of ending the sometimes violent political conflict that has roiled the country since the 2006 coup. Critics charge it is meant to help Thaksin escape justice and return to Thailand as a free man.

_____

April 2013: The Constitutional Court rules that Yingluck's government cannot make amendments to the 2007 constitution, which was enacted by an interim government that had been installed by the 2006 coup.

Nov. 1, 2013: Mass rally held against bill proposing amnesty for political offenses committed since 2006. The protesters claim its main purpose is to vacate the conflict of interest conviction against Thaksin.

Nov. 24, 2013: As many as 100,000 anti-government protesters rally in Bangkok, demanding that Yingluck's government step down.

Nov. 29, 2014: Veteran Democrat Party politician Suthep Thaugsuban forms the People's Democratic Reform Committee to demand the dissolution of Yingluck's government and the establishment of an unelected ""people's council"" to reform the country.

Nov. 30, 2013-Jan. 31, 2014: The anti-government protests become increasingly violent, with pitched street battles against the police and forced occupations of government offices and installations that practically immobilized government functions. The army, which used armed force in 2010 to quash aggressive protests by supporters of Thaksin, does not intervene to defend the government.

Dec. 9, 2013: Yingluck dissolves the House of Representatives and calls early elections for Feb. 2, 2014.

Dec. 21, 2013: The opposition Democrat Party announces it will boycott the elections so that reforms of the sort demanded by the protesters can first be enacted.

_____

Feb. 2, 2014: A general election is held but disrupted by anti-government protesters who prevent polling from being held in all areas.

March 21, 2014: The Constitutional Court rules the February election invalid because voting did not take place on the same day nationwide in violation of a constitutional clause. There had been fresh balloting in March in several provinces where protesters had prevented voting on the original election date.

May 7, 2014: The Constitutional Court removes Yingluck and several ministers of her caretaker government for abuse of power in connection with the 2011 transfer of a high-ranking civil servant.

May 8, 2014: National Anti-Corruption Commission finds Yingluck guilty of criminal negligence for implementing a state rice-buying subsidy scheme.

May 22, 2014: Army Commander Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha stages a coup, ousting the government, abrogating the constitution and outlawing political gatherings. He later becomes prime minister in addition to heading the ruling junta.

_____

Aug 7, 2016: A national referendum approves a new constitution drafted under the auspices of the ruling junta, along with new rules governing how the prime minister is chosen. Campaigning against the proposed charter had been banned.

Oct. 13, 2016: King Bhumibol Adulyadej dies at the age of 88, and a year-long mourning period is declared. He is succeeded by his son, who becomes King Maha Vajiralongkorn.

Jan. 23, 2019: The Election Commission announces the general election will be held on March 24, after several earlier target dates had been pushed back.

Feb. 8, 2019: The Thaksin-affiliated Thai Raksa Chart Party registers the king's elder sister, Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, as its candidate for prime minister, breaking with the idea that members of the royal family are above politics. That same day, the king issues a royal order calling her registration inappropriate and contrary to the constitution.

March 8, 2019: The Constitutional Court dissolves the Thai Raksa Chart Party for registering the princess as its candidate for prime minister.

March 24, 2019: Thailand is scheduled to hold general election.",132,Fox News,Timeline: Key events since Thailand's last general election
"BANGKOK - Thailand's election Sunday is likely to produce a weak unstable government whether it's a civilian or military-backed party that cobbles together a coalition, setting off a new phase of uncertainty in a country that's a U.S. ally in Southeast Asia and one of the world's top tourist destinations.

The election is Thailand's first since its military seized power from an elected government in May 2014. It was the conservative establishment's third major attempt by either military or legal coup to eradicate the influence of Thaksin Shinawatra, a tycoon who made his fortune in telecommunication and upended Thailand's politics with a populist political revolution nearly two decades ago.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who as army chief led the 2014 coup, is hoping to stay in power with a hybrid political system that relies on an appointed Senate and a 20-year national strategic plan to limit the power of political parties not aligned with the military.

""It will be unstable,"" said Prajak Kongkirati, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University. ""Whatever party wins, Prayuth or Thaksin's side, both governments will be weak and unstable,"" he said. ""The government can collapse within a year or a year and a half and we might have a new election quite soon.""

Prayuth's five years as junta leader have been marred by complaints of human rights violations and growing economic inequality. Thailand's ties with the U.S. cooled because of the coup and Prayuth is seeking greater international legitimacy with an election meant to provide the appearance of a return to democracy.

If the junta had one success, it was reinforcing its claim to be protector of Thailand's monarchy, an institution at the heart of Thai society, following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016 after a reign of seven decades and the succession of his son Maha Vajiralongkorn.

Critic say the new military-designed political system is intrinsically unstable because it is not accepted by all sides and will be the beginning of a new round of struggle in Thailand.

The country's prime minister will not be directly elected by its 51 million voters. Instead 750 lawmakers -- 500 from an elected lower house of parliament and 250 from a junta-appointed Senate -- will decide by simple majority. The prime minister does not have to be a member of parliament.

None of the major political parties is likely to have enough elected lawmakers to choose a prime minister and form a government outright. Chaotic outcomes, such as a military favored prime minister chosen with Senate backing that lacks a majority in the parliament, are possible.

Sunday's vote is the latest episode in a sometimes violent political struggle that pits Thaksin's political machine against a conservative establishment led by the ultra-royalist military.

Thaksin swept to power in 2001 with social welfare policies aimed at uplifting the majority rural poor. He lives in exile after he was ousted by a 2006 military coup and accused of abuse of power, corruption and self-enrichment. Some saw him as disrespectful to the monarchy.

The 2014 coup ousted the government that was led by Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was the head of the Thaksin-allied Pheu Thai party at the time.

On Friday, Thaksin hosted a glittering wedding reception in Hong Kong for his youngest daughter, causing a sensation and substantial media and online coverage in Thailand. Guests included the Thai king's sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, who last month made a spectacular but quickly aborted attempt to be a prime ministerial candidate for a small Thaksin-allied party.

Though ostensibly a family affair, the ceremony's timing two days ahead of the election seemed to implicitly say: Don't forget me and my political allies when you go out to vote.

The Pheu Thai party remains broadly popular, especially in the country's north and northeast, home to the majority of voters, and its current leader Sudarat Keyuraphan has urged all Thais to vote, hoping a high turnout will derail Prayuth's plans to stay in power.

""If Pheu Thai does reach the number needed to form a new government, it is unclear how the military leadership would respond,"" said John Ciorciari, a Southeast Asia expert at the University of Michigan.

""Regardless of the election result, it is unlikely to put an end to Thailand's protracted political crisis,"" he said.

"The politics and the fallout from the completion of the Mueller report

MSNBC host Chris Matthews expressed outrage on Friday upon hearing reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had completed his Russia investigation and submitted it to the attorney general -- with further indictments not expected.

SCHIFF REJECTS REPORTS THAT INDICTMENTS ARE OVER

Matthews began his show by summarizing the breaking news, but stressed that Mueller handed his report to the Department of Justice ""without ever directly interviewing the president of the United States.""

""That means no charges against the president, his children or his associates after all those meetings with the Russians,"" a visibly upset Matthews told his viewers.

The liberal cable news host opened the discussion to the panel, telling them his ""biggest question"" was ""How can the president be pointed to as leading collusion with Russia, aiding a Russian conspiracy to interfere with our elections if none of his henchmen, none of his children, none of his associates have been indicted?""

NBC News national security reporter Ken Dilanian responded by telling Matthews that Trump couldn't be indicted ""in a criminal sense"" since Mueller's office ""didn't have it,"" adding that the president ""couldn't conspire with himself.""

""Maybe he missed the boat here,"" Matthews responded. ""Because we know about the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, we know about the meeting at the cigar bar with Kilimnik. My God, we know about all of those meetings with Kislyak at the Republican convention in Cleveland. All these dots we're now to believe don't connect.""

""Well, that's the conclusion in front of us,"" Dilanian told Matthews. ""All of that stuff was suggestive, it didn't prove anything.""

""Why was there never an interrogation of this president?"" Matthews shot back. ""We were told for weeks by experts, 'You cannot deal with an obstruction-of-justice charge or investigation without getting the motive... How could they let Trump off the hook?... He will not be charged with obstruction of justice or collusion without having to sit down with the Special Counsel Mueller and answer his damn questions. How could that happen?""",134,Fox News,MSNBC's Chris Matthews livid over Mueller report: 'How could they let Trump off the hook?'
"The politics and the fallout from the completion of the Mueller report

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff rejected reports that no more Mueller indictments are coming, and suggested he would call the special counsel before a House panel if necessary to learn what is in the report.

""If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee, I would imagine the judiciary committee may call the attorney general if necessary,"" the California Democrat said during an interview on CNN.

""At the end of the day, the department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence. And it's hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.

""We have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.""

'THIS IS A GRAND SLAM:' TRUMP TEAM 'CONFIDENT' NO COLLUSION IN MUELLER REPORT

I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff

Schiff was then asked if he would be satisfied if ""the most sensitive information"" obtained by Mueller was only shared with the so-called ""gang of eight.""

""No, it would not suffice. Now, there may be a select sub-section of information they feel they can only share because of the very sensitive sources which derived the information, but he volumes of information that has been found needs to be shared with the whole committee so we can evaluate what steps have to be taken to protect the country.""

""We're going to need to have the same sort of discovery that we saw during the last Congress, and indeed it may be far more extensive than that, to make sure that U.S. policy is driven by U.S. interest and not because the president or anyone around him is looking to make money from the Kremlin on a tower or anything else.

Schiff did not answer host Wolf Blitzer's question as to whether or not any potential testimony would be public or behind closed doors.

MUELLER NOT RECOMMENDING FURTHER INDICTMENTS AFTER REPORT TURNOVER

In a separate interview with MSNBC, Schiff disagreed with reports there will be no more indictments forthcoming, saying instead it is ""entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be"" more.

""Well, what it means is that the office of the special counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that office won't be bringing any further indictments,"" he said.

""It doesn't mean, of course, that main justice or the Seventh District of New York and the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments,""

""In fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the special counsel eluding to other investigations, I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments.

READ THE LETTER: AG BILL BARR'S LETTER TO LAWMAKERS ANNOUNCING HE RECEIVED MUELLER REPORT

""Now, how central or peripheral they'll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.""

President Trump's legal team projected confidence Friday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not find collusion connected to the president, as he turned over the results of his exhaustive probe into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election.

""This marks the end of the Russia investigation. We await a disclosure of the facts,"" attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News late Friday. ""We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president and this underscores what the president has been saying from the beginning -- that he did nothing wrong.""

Giuliani's statement comes after Mueller transmitted his report to Attorney General William Barr.

MSNBC HOST CHUCK TODD, PANEL HERALD 'REMARKABLE' MUELLER INVESTIGATION, SAY IT WILL 'GO DOWN IN HISTORY'

The conclusions are not yet known, but Barr indicated he might be able to advise Congress of the main takeaways as early as this weekend.

""This is a grand slam for President Trump. If Barr says he can brief Congress by this weekend, that means he has nothing,"" said Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney who has advised Trump on the probe.

Fox News' Brooke Singman, John Roberts and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.",135,Fox News,"Adam Schiff rejects reports that Mueller indictments are over, says special counsel could be called to testify"
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren has reignited the debate over the Electoral College -- she wants to get rid of it, naturally. I say ""reignited"" because this is a very old argument. But I'm going to skip rehashing the usual -- and to my mind, persuasive -- arguments in favor of the Electoral College.

Arguments against it tend to boil down to two gripes: It's very old-fashioned, and it's undemocratic.

In 2016, the last time we had this kerfuffle, ""Handbook of Electoral System Choice"" author Josep Colomer wrote in The Washington Post: ""The US electoral college is a medieval relic . . . The United States is the only country in the world to still use the system to elect a president.""

Warren says she wants to get rid of the Electoral College because she wants ""every vote"" to matter. The widespread insinuation -- or the assumption -- is that this is how most enlightened democracies do it: a direct election of a single national leader.

That's nonsense. First, most democracies don't have presidents like we do (or at all). We combine the head of state (the symbolic, generally weak representative of the nation) and the head of government (the person who actually calls the shots in politics).

The UK has a monarch (head of state) and a prime minister (head of government). Sometimes a legislative body picks the head of government or head of state. Sometimes voters pick one but not the other. In the Netherlands, the head of state is a monarch and the head of government is elected by the legislature (i.e., the majority party).

In New Caledonia the head of government is elected by the legislature, and the head of state is the president of France. Go figure.

There are countries that combine both roles in one person -- Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Ghana, Brazil, Benin and a few others -- but no Western European country has a unified leader directly elected by the people.

Even this is misleading. As Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution has observed, America is the only advanced democracy that has decided to strip its political parties of the power to select their own candidates. Until 1972 -- through conventions, smoke-filled rooms, etc. -- the parties, not the voters, determined who their presidential candidates would be. This function is among the informal checks and balances that make democracy workable around the globe; we scrapped it in favor of ever more open primaries.

America now suffers from a political paradox: This is one of the most partisan times in American history, but the parties have never been weaker. Abolishing the Electoral College would make parties even weaker by further incentivizing populist politicians to work outside the system to cultivate celebrity and cults of personality.

I think the way the Electoral College forces candidates to build broader coalitions across the nation is valuable. The way it minimizes the risks of interminable recounts and voter fraud (a single national tally would be a nightmare logistically) is important. But none of these things are essential by themselves.

What's essential is the ability to have some check on direct democracy and the centralization of power that comes with it. Our specific constitutional architecture isn't necessarily sacred, but the underlying idea behind it should be.

The founders understood that democracy depends on some undemocratic mechanisms to maintain liberty. For instance, the Bill of Rights and the Supreme Court are not purely democratic. You can't vote away my right to free speech.

Most of our political problems today are a result of our political gatekeepers surrendering to the mob. All extreme political movements are hostile to restraints on their will. This is what unites the progressives who want to pack the Supreme Court, abolish the Electoral College and ""reform"" the ""undemocratic"" Senate and those on the right who celebrate President Trump's emergency declaration and other attempts to rule by fiat.

In a healthy democracy, leaders are answerable not just to voters but to legislatures, the courts, the states and parties. The decades-long trend has been to dismantle this arrangement to make presidents answerable to no one but the slice of electorate that voted for them.

And even there, those voters are increasingly more interested in seeing their leader ""win"" than in holding them accountable. Abolishing the Electoral College would be another step toward a kind of national absolutism, which is an even worse medieval relic.",136,New York Post,The Electoral College may be 'medieval'  --  but it's a bulwark
"Friday on MSNBC's ""Deadline,"" former CIA Director John Brennan declared that ""autocrats and authoritarians around the world"" were taking advantage of an opportunity to manipulate and exploit President Donald Trump.

When asked about foreign intelligence agencies' psychological profile of Trump, Brennan said, ""To talk about how erratic he is, to talk about his narcissism, I believe they would put that in there, about how he does things to advance himself personally or politically. And it's unpredictable in some respects but predictable in other things. You can always expect Donald Trump to do whatever is going to advance his interests, irrespective. And he's going to lie and cheat about it.""

He added, ""I would like to read the British intelligence profile of him because British intelligence is very good. I think they're very perceptive on it. I do think all of these leaders, the authoritarian leaders have been able to take advantage of his being prone to flattery. But I think a lot of the leaders of the liberal Western democracies are really quite unsettled because there used to be strength in Washington in the sense you can count on the United States to support what you're trying to do in terms of, you know, regional or international politics and the geo-strategic objectives. But this individual in the Oval Office, Donald Trump, is somebody that is so different from anything we've experienced in the past, and that's why our friends and partners, I believe, are worried. And the autocrats and authoritarians around the world are gleefully taking advantage of the ability to manipulate and exploit Donald Trump's failures and failings.""",137,Breitbart,Brennan: Autocrats 'Gleefully Taking Advantage' of Trump's 'Failings' | Breitbart

MUELLER SUBMITS LONG-AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT

Fox News: ""Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted to Attorney General Bill Barr his long-awaited report on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race and possible collusion with Trump associates -- marking the end of the politically explosive probe and the beginning of a new battle over its contents and implications. The report was delivered earlier Friday afternoon to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's office and it was delivered to Barr's office within minutes, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The White House was notified that the DOJ had received the report around 4:45 p.m., before lawmakers on Capitol Hill were informed. Both Barr and Rosenstein have seen the report, according to a senior DOJ official. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted following the report's drop. 'The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,' she said. 'The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report.'

'We at the Carter Center sure are rooting for him and are grateful for his long life of service that has benefited millions of the world's poorest people,' the center said in a statement. ... Already, Carter had set for presidential record for living the longest number of years out of office, at 38 plus. But then again, he started the job young.

POLL: WINNING IS FOCUS FOR DEMS, NOT IDEOLOGY IN 2020

USA Today: ""As the 2020 presidential field takes shape, Democratic voters by double digits say they are more interested in nominating a candidate who can defeat President Trump than one they agree with most on the issues, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds. By 55-35 percent, the Democrats surveyed endorse electability over ideological purity even though they also embrace progressive priorities such as the Green New Deal. They are even inclined to be open to a nominee who espouses socialism. The debate over balancing policy positions with electoral appeal is always part of the calculation in campaigns. Almost a year before the Iowa caucuses open the nominating contests, it has taken on particular intensity as a sprawling field jockeys to challenge a Republican president who inflames the opposition. ... Among Democratic and independent voters combined, sentiment was more closely divided: 48 percent say they want the Democratic Party to nominate 'a candidate who can win, even if different from my priorities,' while 38 percent prefer 'a candidate in line with my priorities, even if it is harder to win.'""

Trump is ready, revealing his 'dream' 2020 rival - Fox News: ""President Trump, in an extensive interview with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo, accused Democrats embracing ideas like court-packing and the Green New Deal of becoming 'radicalized' -- while voicing confidence as he sized up the ever-expanding field of potential 2020 opponents. The president mocked the Democratic contenders for 'saying a lot of weird things,' calling the Green New Deal 'the most preposterous thing' and blasting Beto O'Rourke's idea of taking down sections of border wall. But asked which candidate in the massive field he'd truly like to run against in 2020, Trump threw out a few names: 'I mean, I'd love to have [Joe] Biden. I'd love to have Bernie [Sanders], I'd love to have Beto,' he said, adding: 'I mean, Beto seems to be the one the press has chosen. The press seems to have chosen Beto. ... When I watch Beto, I say we could dream about that.'""

Drucker: 'Republicans resigned to Trump losing 2020 popular vote' - WashEx: ""Senior Republicans are resigned to President Trump losing the popular vote in 2020, conceding the limits of the flamboyant incumbent's political appeal and revealing just how central the Electoral College has become to the party's White House prospects. Some Republicans say the problem is Trump's populist brand of partisan grievance. It's an attitude tailor-made for the Electoral College in the current era of regionally Balkanized politics, but anathema to attracting a broad, national coalition that can win the most votes, as past presidents did when seeking re-election amid a booming economy. Others argue that neither Trump, nor possibly any Republican, could win the popular vote when most big states are overwhelmingly liberal. ... If Trump wins a second term without the popular vote, it would mark the first time in American history that the candidate who finished second in overall votes won consecutive presidential elections.""

What's Beto all about? - WaPo: ""In his first blitz as a candidate for president, O'Rourke has dealt with nagging questions -- Is a failed Senate candidate ready for the presidency? Is he serious about policy? -- with real-time prose. Other candidates talk in applause lines, while O'Rourke speaks in paragraphs, with lots of asides and emphasis and aphorisms. The result (so far) is the first Democratic campaign to really shake up this race since Kamala Harris's enormous early crowds surprised her rivals and boosted her in public polls. It is not like any other campaign -- by design. He's still figuring this whole thing out. More than any other candidate for the presidency, O'Rourke admits that he does not have all the answers and will get things wrong. He thanks crowds for telling him what he did not know. He thanks reporters for being patient with him -- after some complaints about access in Iowa, he began to hold 10- to 15-minute news conferences after nearly every event.""

Donors shy from Biden - CNBC: ""Several top Democratic donors have told former Vice President Joe Biden that they won't help him raise funds in the early stages of the party's 2020 presidential primary, CNBC has learned. Their reason: skepticism that Biden actually can win the Democratic primary. Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run, has reached out to leading financiers over the past week to see whether they will help him raise money for a presidential run. ... However, during those calls, some high-profile donors told Biden that they will not commit to bundling for him, at least in the early stages of the primary, said the people, who declined to be named. The donors told Biden they're not yet convinced he can overtake the younger, more diverse and progressive field, and that they are going to wait to see how he competes in the race, the people added.""

Many 2020 Dems will not attend AIPAC summit - AP: ""Multiple Democratic presidential candidates said Thursday that they won't attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference in Washington next week. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, are among the 2020 contenders who have decided not to attend. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for president, will also avoid the AIPAC conference. It comes as the liberal advocacy group MoveOn has called on Democratic presidential candidates to skip this year's policy conference, saying AIPAC had tried to thwart the Iran nuclear deal and had employed 'anti-Muslim and anti-Arab rhetoric.' By not attending, the Democratic candidates can demonstrate their progressive bona fides in an increasingly crowded 2020 field.""

HOUSE DEMS' CAMPAIGN ARM SEEKS PRIMARY TRUCE

National Journal: ""The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making an early move to deter primary challenges against sitting incumbents in the caucus with a new policy aimed in part at protecting the new majority. The campaign arm on Friday sent out a list of hiring standards to more than 100 political firms, including one provision that made clear it will neither contract with nor recommend to House candidates any political vendors that work to oust sitting members of Congress. That offers key protection to the caucus's moderate members in battleground seats, where House control will be won or lost. It is intended to help stymie attempts by insurgent progressive groups who plan to primary incumbents deemed insufficiently liberal on key issues, but also to shield members of the party's ascendant liberal wing who represent safe Democratic territory and could face intraparty challenges of their own.""

FROM THE BLEACHERS

""It would be very helpful, given all the talk about eliminating the Electoral College, if you could enlighten us regarding what would be required to change it. Most of the angst about this situation seems to stem from the perception of 'the unfairness' of it all, when I believe the original purpose was to ensure that all states got an appropriate voice. The 'popular' vote for Hillary came from a few very populous places and was not representative of the country as a whole. In addition, as a number of states have passed legislation to assign all their delegates to the popular vote as an 'end run', as it were, around the Constitution, I would guess that would be challengeable legally and ultimately end up going through the constitutional process I initially requested that you elucidate."" - Michael McEvoy, Houston

[Ed. note: The way to eliminate or alter the Electoral College is straight forward but hard: Amend the Constitution. A number of Democratic leaning states, however, have a plan to attack the Constitution and eliminate the Electoral College without putting the matter before all 50 states. Thirteen states have joined a compact in which they have agreed to award their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote, regardless of how their citizens cast their ballots. This deal would kick in once the states with the combined total of 270 electoral votes have joined the compact. Much that is lost in the discussion about the Electoral College is its actual purpose. We tend to see it as a practical, political matter: Something that is good for Republicans and bad for Democrats. The Electoral College, though, is more about the balance of power than it is about partisan control. Taking away the value of states as individual political units would further decrease their ability to counterbalance the national government. Remember Madison's belief that ambition must be made to counteract ambition. There is very little left in the way of the federal government's ambitions, regardless of who is in power.]

""I am a long time and very satisfied subscriber to 'Halftime Report' and was recently traveling in the New Zealand and Australia area and at times, WiFi was spotty or nonexistent and thus it was difficult to keep up with our news. Consequently, I have an even greater appreciation for the daily content of your 'note' as I was able to stay current with our political news and thus, indirectly with other happenings... I looked forward to each opportunity to receive emails and sit back and catchup. One of our guides in Australia told us about their mandated voting laws which I found to be very interesting... the voting age is 18 and if a person neglects to vote, they are fined and possibly face a day in court. The fine for a first offense is $20.00 which is not an exorbitant amount of money but reports have noted that it does seem to be enough of an incentive to achieve a very high percentage of voter turnout at election time. I also subscribe to the 'Halftime Report' on Fox Nation and never fail to pick up an 'I didn't know or realize that' not to mention the comfortable and fun conversation between you while 'Brainstorming with Stirewalt'!"" - Patricia White, North Myrtle Beach, S.C.

[Ed. note: In the spirit of full disclosure, Ms. White, I think our readers should know that you are the grandmother of our own dear Brianna. But that's a bias I can definitely allow here! Many Americans have observed approvingly of Australia's compulsory voting regime. If you think what's wrong with our politics is that not enough people are participating, then one can see why. I look at it a little differently. The voting franchise is an extraordinary privilege, one that history would rightly regard as unusual. In the United States, we have had universal suffrage since the 1920s by law and the 1960s in reality. It's extraordinary compared to most of history and much of the world today. If you cannot be bothered to exercise so great a privilege, why on earth would I want you to vote? I think the problem that we have traces its roots to a lack of civics education in which too few Americans understand the value of their votes and an increasingly jumbled political calendar. I have long advocated for making Election Day a federal and national holiday while also curtailing the ever-extending early voting calendar and mail-in balloting. I would like to see a return to a communitarian ethic for American elections. Thank you for your thoughtful question, your high praise and for helping to make such a fine colleague as your granddaughter.]

HE WAS JUST TRYING TO GET TO ELECTRIC AVENUE

KABC: ""A slow-speed chase through the San Fernando Valley ended with the suspect breakdancing as officers held him at gunpoint. The chase began in Calabasas when California Highway Patrol officers said a reckless driver failed to yield to commands to stop. The driver led officers on a chase over the 101 Freeway through the San Fernando Valley, north on the 405 Freeway and east onto the 118 Freeway. The suspect mostly drove at speeds under 60 mph, making no evasive maneuvers to escape the officers but also declining to pull over. He slowed to about 20 mph on the 118 and then exited on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Officers followed closely behind and were finally able to spin out his vehicle with a PIT maneuver in the Pacoima area. He got out of the car and complied with officers' orders, but then at one point began breakdancing.""

Foreign desk: Golan Switch Was No Impulse Tweet

As The Atlantic's Kathy Gilsinan notes, President Trump ""once again overturned decades of US policy via Twitter"" when he said Washington should recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967. Like the earlier move of the US embassy to Jerusalem, it appeared to offer ""a major gift"" to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just ahead of Israeli elections ""without any obvious concession in return."" But the push to make such a move ""has been going on for more than a year, due to parallel efforts by Israeli officials and members of Congress,"" and was ""being discussed at the highest levels of the State Department and the National Security Council."" For its backers, declaring Israeli sovereignty is, like the embassy move, ""a recognition of reality.""

Historian: Is This What Could Doom Elizabeth Warren?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is languishing in both the polls and the money race for president, and ""there's no single answer for her slow start,"" observes Jeff Greenfield at Politico. Some of it may be her DNA test, or the fact that she's a woman, or that she ""feels too much like yesterday's news."" But there might be a ""more difficult hurdle"" -- the fact that she's a senator. Fact is, only three sitting senators (Warren Harding, JFK and Barack Obama) have ever been elected president. And ""with distrust of government at record levels,"" the optimism of Warren and the five other Democratic senators now running ""seems unwarranted."" Then again, since Harry Truman in 1944, every Democratic vice presidential nominee (save Geraldine Ferraro) has been a sitting senator.

From the left: McCain Insults Finally Stir Republicans

The first thing to remember about President Trump's continuing Twitter insults of the late Sen. John McCain, says Bloomberg's Timothy O'Brien, is that he's ""spent decades aiming his slingshot at everyone around him."" Leona Helmsley, Jerry Nadler, Olympic skater Katarina Witt, the Pritzker family -- all have been on the receiving end of Trump's bile over the years. All that's changed is that he's ""become the most powerful man in the world"" and ""social media has given him a platform to spout nasty 24/7 in front of a live audience."" But his fuming about McCain drew pointed criticism from several Republicans, notably Sen. Johnny Isakson. True, some ""still hesitate to respond forcefully to Trump even when he attacks old friends and colleagues."" But those who came to John McCain's defense ""are on the right side of history.""

Liberal take: Socialists Set To Transform Chicago Politics

Two members of the Democratic Socialists of America have already won seats this year on Chicago's 50-member City Council, and four more are vying in the April 2 runoff elections, reports The Guardian's Eric Lutz. Those candidates confidently predict their election will ""transform"" the way Chicago operates. Part of this is a reaction to people -- particularly minorities and the poor -- feeling ""victimized"" by the city's Democratic political machine. But Chicago ""also has a history of radical politics,"" and these candidates see their momentum as ""the start of a culture shift.""

Joining forward Brett Connolly, who said Monday he was turning down the invitation, Holtby said Friday he was ""respectfully declining"" the invite.

"Rep. Dan Crenshaw warns of dangers of identity politics in America

Former Navy SEAL-turned-politician Dan Crenshaw is taking aim at political correctness.

Rep. Crenshaw, R-Texas, said Friday that identity politics is a problem in America that will have dire consequences for the military and the country.

""It's certainly a problem in America at-large. What is identity politics? It's this temptation to divide us up into different groups. Whether that be based on race, gender, or some other category and then pit those groups against each other and compete for power accordingly,"" Crenshaw said on ""Fox & Friends.""

DEMOCRATS TURN ON EACH OTHER USING IDENTITY POLITICS

""The way America should be is the only colors that matter are red, white, and blue. And that we compete according to our competency, that we compete according to a meritocracy which is really a fundamental element to the military. If you take that away from the military... the military will eventually fail and our country at-large will fail.""

Crenshaw was reacting to comments from retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland who Monday called identity politics a ""cancer"" and said it was getting harder to get everybody ""playing for the same team.""

Crenshaw agreed with MacFarland and was critical of America's colleges for their role in promoting identity politics.

"President Trump's decision to issue an executive order protecting freedom of speech on America's college campuses marks an inflection point in a decades-long struggle over the direction of the American academy. Trump's order -- which I strongly support -- is not the weak and largely symbolic move some claim. On the contrary, it's a game changer.

It will take some time to become evident, but Trump's order will shift the balance of forces on campus. Universities will now have to take loss of federal funding into account when creating speech codes, so-called free speech zones, or bias-reporting systems, or handling visiting speakers. It's true that the new order might be enforced either lightly or assertively, and we don't yet know how that will play out. Yet the very existence of the order sets up a dynamic that will make it harder for colleges to stifle free speech, and tougher for regulators to ignore it when they do.

The early line is that Trump's order merely reaffirms existing law, and is thus little more than a meaningless sop to his base. After all, the order simply insists that public universities uphold the First Amendment, something they are already legally required to do. As for private universities, all they need to do is follow their own stated policies. So what has really changed?

This critique entirely misses the point. Public universities are indeed obligated to uphold the First Amendment. The problem is that they regularly ignore that charge and promulgate unconstitutional speech codes, speech zones, and bias-reporting systems anyway. There's a cottage industry in lawsuits against public universities that violate the First Amendment, as well as against private colleges that flout their own stated free-speech principles. Plaintiffs usually win once they muster the time, money, and courage to sue, but universities quickly find roundabout ways to reinstitute the offending policies, beginning the cycle again. If colleges face a loss of federal funds, however, they just might give up on evading the First Amendment.

University offices of legal counsel are going to think a whole lot harder about campus speech codes, speech-zones, and bias-reporting systems once they're facing a potential withdrawal of federal funding, instead of just a ""red light"" rating from FIRE. Campus legal offices are cautious to a fault and can't afford to rely on the hope of lax federal enforcement. What's more, it's likely that a bad speech code rating from FIRE or a complaint from Alliance Defending Freedom will filter back to the regulators. In fact, there may even be a formal mechanism developed that will allow free-speech groups to make the case that a university policy is either unconstitutional or in violation of its own stated promises. If this enforcement mechanism isn't available at first, it could be added eventually under public pressure.

What's going to happen when a college that has embraced the University of Chicago's free-speech principles manifestly violates them? Almost every campus already has a never-enforced rule against shout-downs. What's going to happen when a school refuses to discipline a manifest violation of that rule? Shout-downs aren't exactly secret. You're likely to catch the next one on a viral video. Even if regulators would prefer to do nothing, inaction in the face of video evidence will be difficult.

In this way, Trump's executive order creates an entirely new enforcement dynamic on a new playing field. The administration will either actively enforce the new rule, or be publicly attacked by its base for refusing to do so in the face of obvious violations. In many -- perhaps most -- cases, university offices of legal counsel will remove unconstitutional policies well before regulators even act.

If America's college campuses continue to maintain and promulgate unconstitutional speech policies, the public will demand better enforcement, or a more effective rule. Republican administrations will find it tough either to balk at enforcement, or to stay with a meaningless rule. Democratic administrations will find it tough to peel back a rule that merely calls for adherence to the First Amendment where that is already legally required, or adherence to a private college's own stated policies. Certainly, Democratic presidents will come under pressure to enforce the rule against obvious violators. And if a Democratic president were to withdraw Trump's order altogether, that would create a perfectly legitimate electoral issue in an area where the public is on the side of free speech.

Another likely consequence of the order is a pullback by private schools on promises of free speech. Will schools still want to adopt the Chicago principles if failing to uphold them could strip them of federal funding? Maybe not, but it's likely that those schools never seriously meant their acceptance of the Chicago statement to begin with. Private colleges that refuse to endorse free speech will expose themselves to public criticism, and rightly so. The result will be greater transparency at private colleges, entirely justified embarrassment, and pressure for real change, as opposed to window-dressing.

So the rule seems weak, but in fact is strong. The secret of its effectiveness is that it only asks colleges to do what they are already legally obligated to do. Who can quarrel with that? But colleges do not in fact do what they are legally obligated to do. And that failure will be easy to document when official campus policy contradicts the First Amendment -- as it so often does -- or when colleges ignore their own rules against shout-downs and other forms of speech suppression -- which they regularly do. Today, colleges manipulate and evade the law, even when they are called on their bad policies by the courts. But Trump's order raises the stakes in a way that colleges may no longer be able to ignore. And it creates a dynamic in which the public will demand follow-through on the sort of openly outrageous cases that crop up regularly nowadays.

So much for policy. What about the politics of the order?

President Trump has done himself a world of political good by issuing this order. Conditioning federal funding on the maintenance of campus free speech will instantly take its place in the litany of policies for which Trump is praised and thanked by his base. It's tough to overestimate how concerned conservatives have become in the past few years over political bias, shout-downs, intimidation, bogus accusations of bigotry, and pervasive self-censorship in the academy. More important, these concerns are shared by swing voters and moderate Democrats, too.

Fifteen years ago, even conservatives were more likely to roll their eyes and shrug at crazy campus hijinks than to express alarm. Preposterous postmodern jargon seemed irrelevant at best. How could something impossible to understand destroy the republic?

Nowadays, in contrast, it's easy to see the connection between campus shout-downs and politicians being chased out of restaurants. Campus intersectionality and green socialism are taking over the Democratic party before our eyes. Most conservatives know young people afraid to speak their minds in dormitories and classrooms, much less write what they believe in their assignments. Conservative parents, torn between their own beliefs their child's best interests, despair of finding a college that won't actively work to turn their son or daughter against their own deepest convictions. And now, twitter mobs straight out of the campus leftist hothouse seem to be coming for everyone.

That President Trump has taken up arms against this sea of troubles solidifies his reputation as the man willing to fight cultural battles that GOP politicians too often shirk. We haven't seen a Republican administration work this boldly against campus illiberalism since the Reagan administration, when education secretary William Bennett challenged Stanford's attack on Western civilization and when Lynne Cheney fought the good fight as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities (continuing through the first Bush administration).

The George W. Bush administration deliberately avoided the bully pulpit on campus issues under the misapprehension that this would squander its political capital. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Standing up to illiberal campus extremists is a sure political winner. And today, two years into the free-speech crisis kicked off by the rash of campus shout-downs in early 2017, Congress has done exactly nothing to solve the problem.

I understand why some Republicans are reluctant to invoke the federal government -- even to protect a right as fundamental as free speech -- although I disagree with this view. Even so, Congress hasn't even been able to pass a mere ""sense of the Congress"" resolution condemning free-speech zones -- a resolution with bipartisan backing. It doesn't get any easier than that. The contrast between congressional inaction and Trump's bold move is striking.

Trump is a fighter, rough around the edges and certainly not steeped in conservative thought like Reagan was. But somehow Donald Trump has brought back the feistiness of the Reagan years on the campus culture wars, in a way that Republican politicians ought to have done for the past 25 years -- but never had the guts to do. The country has paid a heavy cultural price for that inaction. You want to know why Trump is loved by his base? This is why.

What about the Democrats? Has freedom of speech actually become a partisan issue? That really would be deadly for the republic. Finding out how the parties handle this question is going to tell us a lot about the state of the culture, but it's going to take some time for things to shake out.

It's certain that the Dems won't attack free speech in response to Trump's order. Instead they'll sound like conservative converts, with lots of talk about the dangers of bureaucratic meddling and federal overreach. Of course the real conservative position would be to stop the massive federal subsidies to higher education altogether, but Democrats would never put that on the table. They want more free money for college, not less. Dems will also hope for the courts to stop to the order, although there's plenty of precedent for requiring recipients of federal largesse to protect fundamental civil rights.

There's plenty of room for good-faith disagreement about federal guarantees of campus free speech. That said, Democratic critics won't want to talk about one of their major concerns. If they were to admit that there's a campus free-speech crisis and that it has to be addressed far more aggressively, they'd quickly find themselves cross-wise with the newly-energized Democratic left. A shocking number of young people now approve of shout-downs and even violence as tactics to stifle ""hate speech,"" a flexible category commonly stretched to cover nearly any policy the left doesn't like. This means that Democrats would prefer this issue to go away.

Yet unless the courts put a quick end to it, President Trump's executive order will soon generate concrete examples of unconstitutional policies that don't make the federal cut. That will anger campus radicals, and potentially split Democrats on the issue.

Trump's order is also likely to supercharge the already robust campus-reform debate at the state level. Campus-free-speech bills have been passed or introduced in a great many states in recent years. Some are stronger than others. Over time, Trump's order may kick off another round of legislative strengthening.

The possibility of a second wave of state legislative reform on closely related campus issues is also real. I've proposed a model state-level bill to bring greater intellectual diversity to public university campuses, while still respecting academic freedom. And there are plenty of other ways in which the public might play a role in campus reform. Public university systems are governed by trustees appointed by governors and legislators, and funded by the public's representatives as well. Trustees in particular may be energized by the public's newfound concern with campus reform. Successful change modeled at state universities could then spread to private institutions. President Trump's order might kick of a virtuous circle in which public and private universities begin to reform themselves, if only to stave off further legislative initiatives and funding cutoffs.

It's way too early to see its full effects, but Trump's executive order has altered the campus-free-speech playing field, set off a new dynamic in which the public will play a major part, and given an impetus to reform efforts both inside and the outside of the academy. I call that a big win.",142,nationalreview.com,The Politics and Policy of Trump's Campus Free-Speech Order | National Review
"Sanders defends Democratic socialism; reaction and analysis from Fox News contributor Jessica Tarlov and Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley.

The Democratic Socialists of America, whose membership ballooned after the 2016 candidacy of allied Sen. Bernie Sanders, announced its endorsement this week of the Vermont lawmaker in his second bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

""Sanders is the only Democratic Socialist running for president in 2020, and the only socialist in American history with a serious chance of winning the presidency,"" said the DSA in a press release. ""Sanders's platform -- Green New Deal, Medicare for All, College for All, ending cash bail, strengthening unions, and a living wage -- would transform American society by ending the worst forms of poverty and inequality while empowering workers to fight for even more.""

TOP 5 FAILED SOCIALIST PROMISES: FROM LENIN TO CHAVEZ

While the endorsement comes as little surprise, some democratic socialists had raised concerns that Sanders is not socialist enough.

""Sanders 2016 revived the progressive left and turned DSA into the largest socialist organization in America in seventy years,"" former Sanders campaign worker Dan La Botz wrote on the DSA website in opposition to a Sanders endorsement. ""Flooded with young people angry at the Democratic Party, DSA became a radical, activist organization projecting the need for a total socialist transformation of America.""

""Sanders 2020 will not have the same effect,"" La Botz wrote. ""Bernie will not appear to be much different than other progressive Democrats and his campaign threatens to lead DSA deep into the Democratic Party.""

About a quarter of some 13,000 DSA members responding to the organization's poll before the decision to back the senator said they did not support the endorsement of Sanders.

But other DSA followers, who have debated among themselves whether they should seek to gain influence within the Democratic Party or on their own under the socialist banner, see Sanders as their ticket to growth.

An apparent DSA member identified only as ""Neal M."" wrote on the organization's website: ""DSA benefited hugely from being the only socialist organization to actively endorse Sanders in 2016. If we enthusiastically support Sanders in 2020, DSA could become a 100,000 member organization, with significantly greater capacity and resources.""

""The number one lesson we should learn from 2016 is that small socialist organizations must participate in the big movements that dominate national politics.""

Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist. He announced his Democratic presidential bid last month, saying his campaign is about ""creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.""

Sanders spoke to striking university workers in Los Angeles this week and complained about ""a war being waged against the working people.""

The DSA puts its membership at more than 56,000 as of March. Its long-term mission is to run candidates as socialists, and not under the Democratic Party banner.

Ella Mahony of the DSA's national political committee said in recent days that democratic socialists have a unique spotlight right now to further their anti-capitalist agenda and convert more Americans to socialism. Not backing Sanders, she said on the DSA website, would mean losing an opportunity to push their message on a national stage.

""The combination of the Sanders campaign and the teachers' strike wave has made our job as socialists so much easier,"" Mahony said. ""Now, we can go into our campuses or workplaces and find people willing to identify not just as union activists or as socially conscious but as Democratic Socialists.""

"ATLANTA -- Nearly four decades after voters unceremoniously rejected then-President Jimmy Carter's bid for a second term, the 39th president has reached a milestone that electoral math cannot dispute: He is now the longest-living chief executive in American history.

Friday is the 172nd day beyond Carter's 94th birthday, exceeding by one day the lifespan of former President George H.W. Bush, who died Nov. 30 at the age of 94 years, 171 days. Both men were born in 1924: Bush on June 12, Carter on Oct. 1.

It's yet another post-presidency distinction for Carter, whose legacy since leaving office has long overshadowed both his rocky White House tenure and the remarkable political rise that led him from his family peanut farm and a state Senate seat to the governor's mansion and his unlikely presidential victory in 1976.

The achievement also defies medical odds, coming more than three years after Carter announced he had melanoma that had spread to his liver and brain. He underwent treatment and received a clean bill of health.

""There are no special celebrations planned,"" said Deanna Congileo, spokeswoman for the former president and The Carter Center, which Carter and his wife, Rosaylnn, now 91, founded in Atlanta in 1982 to focus on global human rights issues.

The center's decades of public health advocacy, election-monitoring and conflict resolution around the world have redefined the role of former presidents, who before Carter often retired from relative obscurity.

""We at The Carter Center sure are rooting for him and grateful for his long life of service that has benefitted millions of the world's poorest people,"" Congileo said.

Seemingly downplaying his political career, Carter has for years characterized the center's work as his defining professional achievement -- though, of course, having been a U.S. president is what allowed him the stature to establish the center.

""I spent four of my ninety years in the White House, and they were, of course, the pinnacle of my political life,"" Carter wrote in a memoir published on his 90th birthday.

""Those years, though, do not dominate my chain of memories, and there was never an orderly or planned path to get there during my early life.""

Rather, he continued, ""Teaching, writing and helping The Carter Center evolve ... seem to constitute the high points in my life.""

And the man who once held the U.S. nuclear codes, forged a historic Middle East peace deal at Camp David and tried to manage a hostage crisis that sealed his one-term fate has a simple answer whenever he's asked to recount the best or most significant decision he's ever made: ""Asking Rosalynn to marry me.""

The former president and first lady still live in Plains, Georgia, a town of about 750 where they were born, raised and married 73 years ago, weeks after the future commander in chief graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy.

A devout Christian, Jimmy Carter regularly teaches Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church, drawing hundreds of visitors to Plains for each session. The Carters pose for pictures with each attendee.

Though he sometimes de-emphasizes his elected career, living so long after his presidency is allowing Carter a resurgence of sorts in Democratic politics.

Two current presidential candidates, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minneosta, have ventured to Plains to meet with the Carters. The former president has hosted Bernie Sanders, a 2016 and 2020 presidential candidate, for a panel at The Carter Center -- and Carter told the audience that he voted for Sanders over Hillary

Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. He hosted and endorsed Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams in her unsuccessful bid for Georgia governor last year.

Georgia Democrats say they expect more presidential candidates to make a Plains pilgrimage.

As for what's next, Carter has at least one more accomplishment on his mind, pointing often to The Carter Center's long-running effort to eliminate Guinea worm disease, a parasitic infection attributed to poor drinking water.

There were 3.5 million cases in 21 countries in 1986, when the Carter Center began its eradication program. In 2018, there were 28 cases worldwide.

""I'm hoping that I will live longer than the last Guinea worm,"" he said in a British television interview in 2016. ""That's one of my goals in life, and I think I have a good chance to succeed.""",146,New York Post,Jimmy Carter now the longest-living US president in history
"Various news outlets are telling us that the Mueller report is finally on its way. We have no inside information about that, but we should say, apparently, the White House believes it, too.

When Mueller's report does arrive, it will go first to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, and there's not much debate about what should happen after that. Democrats have demanded the release of the entire document. President Trump agrees with them. He said he'd like to see that report go public so that voters can assess it for themselves.

But for now, we'd like to take just a second to put this entire sprawling story into some perspective. Our job is to remember things, to create a record of what has happened in this country over the past few years and what has happened to it. Our grandchildren will want to know. If the left has its way, they will never see the details. It will all be whitewashed, like so much else in our history has been. So let's recall, for the record. what the Robert Mueller investigation is all about - why we've got a special counsel in the first place.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.

The point was not to discover whether the president fudged deductions on his tax returns 30 years ago. It was not to find out whether he wanted to build another hotel in a foreign country. From its first day, the Mueller investigation was justified by a single question: Did Donald Trump collude with the Russian government to steal the 2016 presidential election? Did the president betray his country?

For close to three years, the Democrats have told us that yes, he did do that:

Beto O'Rourke, Democratic presidential candidate: ""It's beyond a shadow of a doubt to me that if there was not collusion, there was at least the effort to collude.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D- Calif, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee : ""I think there is plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight.""

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif: ""There is more to be learned about it. I believe there has been collusion.""

John Podesta, former White House chief of staff: ""It's starting to smell more and more like collusion.""

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, Speaker of the House: ""We saw cold, hard evidence of the Trump campaign, and indeed, the Trump family eagerly intending to collude possibly with Russia.""

These are not minor charges. And if you grew up in this country, it is hard to shrug them off. Now, Maxine Waters is irrelevant -- she's a living sideshow. But Nancy Pelosi is not; he is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. She is third in line to the presidency.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.

Adam Schiff is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He is privy to the most highly classified information our government has. John Podesta was the chief of staff in one White House. He was a senior advisor in another White House. Beto O'Rourke has raised more money than anyone running for president in 2020.

These are not peripheral figures making these charges. They are the most serious people in the modern Democratic Party, and we took them seriously. We felt we had a duty to understand why they were calling the president of the United States a traitor. So we asked them. We here on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" interviewed a number of those people on this show.

One of the most persistent accusers was Congressman Eric Swalwell of California. He is also a member of the House Intelligence Committee. If there was indeed evidence of collusion with Russia, Eric Swalwell would have seen it. Yet, he never produced any, and we asked him repeatedly.

Swalwell responded by accusing us of cutting him off on the air, of not letting him make his case. So finally, in frustration, we offered him a full half hour live on this show to tell us what the evidence was. So months later, Swalwell accepted our invitation. He came on the show, but he never produced a single piece of evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with anyone. Instead, he accused us of working for a foreign power. We had asked Swalwell why the public couldn't see a memo related to the Russia investigation. He responded by accusing us of ""peddling the narrative that the Trump administration is putting out"" and of ""being on the same side as WikiLeaks and Putin.""

So, for asking to see a government document that he himself had seen, Swalwell suggested that we were treasonous. There's been an awful lot of talk like that the past couple of years. It has completely changed Washington. People in this city are now afraid. They watch what they say. They don't send emails. They worry about being denounced. Demagogues like Swalwell have terrified them.

From the beginning of this investigation, there's been virtually no honest, public debate about what is happening or has happened. Congressman Adam Schiff came on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" in the early days of the Trump administration, and we asked a simple fact-based question about what we know and what we don't know about the Russian collusion allegations. We asked him this: Are we certain the Russian government hacked John Podesta's Gmail account? For that, Schiff accused us of ""carrying water for the Kremlin.""

So to this day, even the most basic, the most elemental questions about the claims in this Russia story remain unanswered. Meanwhile, we've upended our entire foreign policy. We put Americans in prison all on the basis of charges nobody has been willing to prove. How do we know that, congressman? ""Shut up, you're a Russian agent.""

The conspiracy hawks seem totally impervious to shame or reason. You couldn't debate them because they wouldn't engage. They just threw slurs. They felt no need to demonstrate that any of it was true.

And it wasn't just Swalwell and Schiff. Some of the most respected, supposedly sober, figures in our society engaged in this behavior for years. They said things that were so reckless and so damaging to this country that it's almost hard to believe it was happening.

John Brennan was the director of the CIA, the most powerful intelligence agency in the world. But then he became a TV pundit and said the following on MSNBC: ""Reports that Mr. Cohen was in Prague despite his denials - repeated denials. There is more and more indications that there is something here that is far, far from being anything near a witch hunt.""

Michael Cohen was in Prague meeting with his Russian handlers. That's what Brennan just told us on cable television. Now, you'd think if anyone would know that fact, it would be the director of the CIA. The CIA knows all. Except perhaps on this one question, Michael Cohen himself might know more.

Cohen was asked directly about it when he testified before Congress. He had no reason to protect Donald Trump. He had many reasons to hurt him. He testified that he had never been to Prague, had never even been to the Czech Republic. At the same hearing, Cohen also told Congress that in all his years working as Donald Trump's personal attorney, one of the most intimate relationships in Donald Trump's life, he had never seen any evidence of collusion with Russia.

Any fair person would consider that the beginning of the end of this story. Case closed. But it was too late. By that point, the Russia investigation had become such a ratings bonanza for the cable news channels that they couldn't slow down. They had no incentive to admit defeat. They had no incentive to acknowledge reality.

So they continued as they had since the inauguration, as if the story was entirely real. Night after night, they brought us an endless parade of screamers, buffoons and halfwits, all claiming knowledge of the conspiracy.

Once the Mueller report appears, and it becomes incontrovertible that whatever his faults, Donald Trump did not collude with the Russians, the many people who have persistently claimed on the basis of no evidence that he did collude with the Russians, ought to be punished. Not indicted or imprisoned, obviously, but thoroughly shamed and forced to apologize.

One among a thousand examples is self-described intelligence expert, Malcolm Nance delivering his analysis on MSNBC: ""When Benedict Arnold gave the plans to West Point to Major Andre and they captured Major Andre, they did not have any real information linking those plans to Benedict Arnold other than the fact he was in his presence at one point during that day. But everyone knew it was treason when they caught the man and they hung him. So at some point, there's going to be a bridge of data here that is going to be unassailable. ""

Thanks for the history lesson, Mr. Nance. They hung him. Let's hang this guy.

After a while, after years of this, voters started to agree. Thanks to this propaganda, 53 percent of registered voters now believe the Trump campaign ""worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election."" Among Democratic voters, 67 percent believe that Russia somehow rigged the vote tally. Nobody's ever explained how exactly the Russians might have done that. But of course, they did it. Russia rigged the elections. CNN says so every night.

There need to be consequences for this. Once the Mueller report appears, and it becomes incontrovertible that whatever his faults, Donald Trump did not collude with the Russians, the many people who have persistently claimed on the basis of no evidence that he did collude with the Russians, ought to be punished. Not indicted or imprisoned, obviously, but thoroughly shamed and forced to apologize.

If Republicans spent three full years falsely claiming that Barack Obama colluded with the government of Iran, would those who claim that ever work in media or politics again? That's a rhetorical question.

Lying and recklessness should never be ignored. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq on the premise that Saddam Hussein possessed massive stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. Many of us believed it. But the claim was false. Thousands of Americans died. Trillions were wasted. Nobody was punished. To this day, Max Boot takes a paycheck from the Washington Post. Bill Kristol appears on MSNBC. John Bolton is this country's National Security Adviser. There were no consequences to their foolishness and their dishonesty -- none.

And so we started a series of eerily similar wars, all with entirely predictable results. Nobody learned anything. Did we learn anything from the Russia collusion hoax? Will the same cast of liars and buffoons simply move on to the next game -- climate change, the Green New Deal? We can't give you details. It's too important. Obey or else!

That could easily happen. In fact, it will happen for certain - unless we remember exactly what we've just seen.",147,Fox News,"Tucker Carlson: When the Mueller report shows Trump didn't collude with Russia, will anyone be punished?"
"Such a move would further incentivize populist politicians to work outside the system to cultivate celebrity and cults of personality.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has reignited the debate over the Electoral College -- she wants to get rid of it, naturally. I say ""reignited"" because this is a very old argument. To paraphrase Billy Joel, Warren didn't start this fire; this debate's been burning since the world's been turning. But I'm going to skip rehashing the usual -- and to my mind, persuasive -- arguments in favor of the Electoral College.

Arguments against it tend to boil down to two gripes: It's very old-fashioned, and it's undemocratic.

In 2016, the last time we had this kerfuffle, Handbook of Electoral System Choice editor Josep Colomer wrote in the Washington Post: ""The U.S. electoral college is a medieval relic. . . . The United States is the only country in the world to still use the system to elect a president.""

Warren says she wants to get rid of the Electoral College because she wants ""every vote"" to matter. The widespread insinuation -- or the assumption -- is that this is how most enlightened democracies do it: a direct election of a single national leader.

That's nonsense.

First, most democracies don't have presidents like we do (or at all). We combine the head of state (the symbolic, generally weak representative of the nation) and the head of government (the person who actually calls the shots in politics).

The U.K. has a monarch (head of state), and a prime minister (head of government). Sometimes a legislative body picks the head of government or head of state. Sometimes voters pick one but not the other. In the Netherlands, the head of state is a monarch and the head of government is elected by the legislature (i.e., the majority party). In New Caledonia the head of government is elected by the legislature, and the head of state is the president of France. Go figure.

There are countries that combine both roles in one person -- Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Ghana, Brazil, Benin, and a few others -- but no Western European country has a unified leader directly elected by the people.

Even this is misleading. As Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution has observed, America is the only advanced democracy that has decided to strip its political parties of the power to select their own candidates. Until 1972 -- through conventions, smoke-filled rooms, etc. -- the parties, not the voters, determined who their presidential candidates would be. This function is among the informal checks and balances that make democracy workable around the globe; we scrapped it in favor of ever more open primaries.

America now suffers from a political paradox: This is one of the most partisan times in American history, but the parties have never been weaker. Abolishing the Electoral College would make parties even weaker by further incentivizing populist politicians to work outside the system to cultivate celebrity and cults of personality.

I think the way the Electoral College forces candidates to build broader coalitions across the nation is valuable. The way it minimizes the risks of interminable recounts and voter fraud (a single national tally would be a nightmare logistically) is important. But none of these things is essential by itself.

What's essential is the ability to have some check on direct democracy and the centralization of power that comes with it. Our specific constitutional architecture isn't necessarily sacred, but the underlying idea behind it should be. The Founders understood that democracy depends on some undemocratic mechanisms to maintain liberty. For instance, the Bill of Rights and the Supreme Court are not purely democratic. You can't vote away my right to free speech, for instance.

Most of our political problems today are a result of our political gatekeepers surrendering to the mob. All extreme political movements are hostile to restraints on their will. This is what unites the progressives who want to pack the Supreme Court, abolish the Electoral College, and ""reform"" the ""undemocratic"" Senate with those on the right who celebrate President Trump's emergency declaration and other attempts to rule by fiat.

In a healthy democracy, leaders are answerable not just to voters but to legislatures, the courts, the states, and parties. The decades-long trend has been to dismantle this arrangement to make presidents answerable to no one but the slice of electorate that voted for them. And even there, those voters are increasingly more interested in seeing their leader ""win"" than in holding them accountable. Abolishing the Electoral College would be another step toward a kind of national absolutism, which is an even worse medieval relic.",148,nationalreview.com,Abolishing the Electoral College Would Be a Mistake | National Review
"One: South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg's father, Joseph Buttigieg, immigrated to the United States from Malta and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1979. He was a professor of European literature who taught at New Mexico State and then Notre Dame. The elder Buttigieg was a fan of Manchester United soccer and easily transitioned to become a fan of Notre Dame football. Buttigieg's mother, Anne Montgomery Buttigieg, was also a professor at Notre Dame for nearly three decades. Joseph Buttigieg passed away in January. Mayor Buttigieg now lives on the same block as his mother and says his mortgage payment on a ""large old house facing the river"" is $450.

Two: Buttigieg is the youngest candidate in the large Democratic field, born in 1982. He was a child or young man for events that might seem ""not that long ago"" to many older voters. He remembers an elementary-school teacher explaining that the maps and globes with the label ""Soviet Union"" were now obsolete. He was ten when Bill Clinton was elected president, a college freshman when George W. Bush was elected president, and a sophomore on 9/11. One of his first jobs out of college was doing research and press work for John Kerry's presidential campaign; he turned down an offer to work for Barack Obama's Senate campaign.

Three: In high school, Buttigieg was senior-class president, valedictorian, and president of the school's chapter of Amnesty International. In his autobiography, Shortest Way Home, he describes his high-school gym teacher as objecting to the group's focus on ""Ay-rabs."" He won an essay contest sponsored by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library as part of the organization's annual Profile in Courage Award. Buttigieg wrote an essay saluting the courage of then-congressman Bernie Sanders, declaring that the congressman's ""real impact has been a reaction to the cynical climate which threatens the effectiveness of the democratic system."" Invited to the JFK library, Buttigieg met Senator Ted Kennedy, and the senator offered him an internship.

His thoughts of running for office started quite early. In Shortest Way Home, Buttigieg writes of his high-school years, ""I had begun to wonder what it would be like to be involved in public service directly, instead of reading or watching movies about it. Could political action be a calling, not just the stuff of dinner table talk?""

Four: Buttigieg was accepted to Harvard University and found that his dorm room had previously housed Ulysses Grant Jr., Cornel West, and Horatio Alger. He describes college life in his autobiography like something out of the X-Men: ""It began to feel like the academy of X-Men: everyone had some concealed special power: Cate, on the second floor, could read books at four or five times the normal pace. Andrew, on the ground floor, could do a Rubik's Cube from any starting point in about a minute. Steve, my roommate, was like a science-fiction telepath; he could dissect social interactions and predict with remarkable accuracy how relationships among other freshmen we knew would play out with time.""

Five: Buttigieg became the student president at Harvard's Institute of Politics, a role described by The New Yorker as being ""sought by the most ambitious of the exceptionally ambitious."" At the time the institute was headed by retired senator David Pryor -- who is credited with being one of Bill Clinton's key political mentors. Buttigieg thanks Pryor for providing ""the political education we really needed.""

He was a board member of the Harvard College Democrats and protested the war in Iraq. He wrote a regular column for the Harvard Crimson, and in one mocked George W. Bush for his Ivy League elitism in poetry form:

The Blue Blood's in me through and through

And not just 'cause of Yale;

It's Kennebunkport, Harvard --

Andover, now there's my tale . . .

Well, think again, since now you know

The shade of my true colors;

You know that I ignore the Tenets,

Powells and even Muellers.

Instead I heed the dicta of

The most extremist Right.

I kept them quiet in the race

But now I fight their fight.

In another column, Buttigieg raved about rap star Eminem for articulating the cultural zeitgeist: ""The anthem of our new life came on an arresting new album from Eminem. Tossing expletives at Dick Cheney and Tipper Gore, Eminem was, as he put it, 'dumping it on White America,' building a new narrative -- aggressively American, abused, angry and alarming. He warned young Americans to think about a draft, joked about Dick Cheney's cardiac health, and lashed out at the 'Divided States of Embarrassment' for abandoning free speech. The national rhetoric of redemption began to ring hollow as this spokesperson of the Midwestern underclass resonated all the way to Harvard.""

Six: A Rhodes Scholarship took Buttigieg to Oxford, where he describes his education in economics: ""One calculus equation at a time, I came to understand in thorough mathematical detail why supply and demand cannot be expected to deliver fair prices or efficient outcomes in many situations. Indeed, even the most orthodox economic theories showed that market failures were all but guaranteed to occur in situations, like health care and education delivery, where a seller has power over a buyer, or a buyer is seeking a service that can't easily be assigned a dollar value, or the seller and buyer have different levels of information about the product."" Buttigieg finished with a ""First,"" the highest grade possible.

After Oxford, Buttigieg went to work for McKinsey & Company in Chicago, writing, ""despite all my education, I felt ignorant about how the private sector really worked."" This was 2007.

Seven: In 2010, at age 27, Buttigieg ran for state treasurer, which he says ""paid less than half of what I'd already been making."" (In 2010, the Indiana state treasurer was paid $68,772 per year.) Buttigieg writes, ""No one was pleading with a twenty-seven-year old management consultant to run for statewide office as a Democrat. I just started to think about it and felt like it could make sense.""

Eight: Buttigieg was an outspoken supporter of the auto-industry bailout in 2009 and 2010. Summarizing the decision today, he claims, ""with remarkable speed, the government had recovered most of the taxpayer money that had gone into the deal."" The accuracy of that statement depends upon how you define ""most."" When the government sold off the last of its shares of stock in the automakers, it had recovered about $70 billion, losing about $10 billion in the process. It is worth noting that while the bailout was being debated, General Motors was manufacturing millions of cars with a dangerous defect in the ignition switch, causing the cars to suddenly stop if the driver's key chain was too heavy and hiding reports of the defect from federal safety inspectors. The defect led to 124 deaths and the recall of 5 million cars. In 2014, GM recalled nearly 14 million cars for safety reasons.

Writing of Indiana treasurer Richard Mourdock's decision to file a lawsuit challenging the legality of the bailout, Buttigieg writes, ""gripped by ideology, Mourdock simply could not accept that government getting involved could be a good thing, even if it prevented the destruction of thousands of lives."" Mourdock won his bid for reelection against Buttigieg, 62.5 percent to 37.5 percent.

Nine: After his defeat, Buttigieg contemplated his next move and started talking about running for mayor, discussing the matter with South Bend residents and retired Democratic officials. Four weeks after Buttigieg's defeat in the state-treasurer race, incumbent mayor Stephen Luecke surprised the city by announcing he would not run for a fourth term.

Ten: This list from 2017 ranks South Bend the 299th-largest city in the United States, just behind Wichita Falls, Texas; Rialto, Calif.; and Davenport, Iowa.

Eleven: When Adam Nagourney of the New York Times reviewed Buttigeig's autobiography, he wrote, ""If the underlying point of this book is to draw attention to himself as a future Democratic leader for a party aching for one, then his thumping re-election as mayor in a state Trump captured with 56 percent is quite a selling card."" Except the politics of South Bend and Indiana as a whole are quite different.

Despite the presence of Notre Dame and the perception of Indiana's overall conservatism, South Bend has been heavily Democratic for a long time. Every South Bend mayor since 1972 has been a Democrat. All of the members of the Indiana General Assembly currently representing South Bend are Democrats. The city's congressional district leans more Republican, but St. Joseph's County, which includes South Bend, is the lone Democratic-leaning county in the district; the rest are more heavily Republican. Former Democratic senator Joe Donnelly used to represent the district.

Twelve: In the mayoral race, Buttigieg faced a state representative, a county councilman, and two lesser-known competitors; the local party deemed him too young and discouraged his interest in the race. Buttigieg saw his name as an advantage: ""An unpronounceable, ethnically ambiguous name is practically an asset in northern Indiana politics. Depending upon their own background, people could assume it was Hungarian, Polish, Serbian, Czech, or Belgian -- all of which carried their own tribal loyalties in the area."" Buttigieg won a majority in the five-way race.

Thirteen: Three months into the job, Buttigieg ran into his first (and so far, most serious) controversy as mayor. He demoted police chief Darryl Boykins and fired police communications director Karen DePaepe after revelations that the department had illegally recorded various officers' phone calls. Boykins had allegedly confronted other officers with what they had said on the tapes, and the tapes reportedly include racist comments and discussions of officers breaking the law. The officers went to the FBI, claiming Boykin had illegally wiretapped them.

Buttigieg refused to release the tapes, contending that because they were illegally recorded, they are not subject to public-records laws; under the Federal Wiretap Act, releasing illegally recorded information is a felony. Some African Americans contended this decision amounted to protecting the officers who made the racist remarks and who had allegedly discussed breaking the law in the course of their duties. The South Bend city council subpoenaed the tapes and any Buttigieg documents relating to the decision on Boykins and DePaepe.

The legal fight that followed was the longest-running and most expensive in city history, with more than $2 million in taxpayer money spent on lawyers and significant settlements: ""The city government paid four officers said to be on the tapes $500,000 after they sued. The city also settled with the former police chief and communications director over their firings, for $75,000 and $230,000, respectively."" The legal fight over whether the tapes should be releasing or destroyed is still ongoing.

Fourteen: Buttigieg's record on controlling crime as mayor is mixed. In 2015, South Bend had a murder rate of 16.79 per 100,000 people, ranking it the 29th-worst among the 300 American cities with 100,000 people or more. Buttigieg implemented a version of the ""Operation Ceasefire"" program touted by David Kennedy.

""Shootings began to rise again in 2016 and 2017, but data from the program suggested it might have been higher otherwise,"" Buttigieg writes in Shortest Way Home. ""And the whole thing would have been worth it just to get the relationships built among the working group that still meets quarterly to oversee the strategy's implementation.""

Fifteen: Two years into his first term, the Washington Post labeled Buttigieg ""the most interesting mayor you've never heard of."" The profile's news hook was Buttigieg's impending six-month deployment to Afghanistan as a naval reservist, and it touted South Bend's new 311 city information line and its plan to deal with 1,000 vacant lots and abandoned buildings in 1,000 days.

Buttigieg declared local government to be the next frontier of youthful energy and cutting-edge innovation: ""In the 60s, you would go to NASA, in the 90s you would go to Silicon Valley, now these people are interested in working in local government.""

Buttigieg's former chief of staff and campaign manager was Mike Schmuhl, who had previously worked at the Washington Post's public relations department.

Sixteen: By 2016, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote a column entitled ""The First Gay President?"" and praised Buttigieg in tones that made the coverage of Beto O'Rourke look restrained and even-handed, beginning, ""if you went into some laboratory to concoct a perfect Democratic candidate, you'd be hard pressed to improve on Pete Buttigieg, the 34-year-old second-term mayor of this Rust Belt city, where he grew up and now lives just two blocks from his parents.""

Bruni wrote that Buttigieg ""seems always to say just the right thing, in just the right tone"" and that ""the daunting scope of his distinctions may be his greatest liability.""

Seventeen: After Trump's election, Buttigieg announced he would run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, urging his party to not ""relitigate old battles"" such as the split between the factions that preferred Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. (Buttigieg endorsed Clinton late in the primary.) The day before the DNC vote, Buttigieg withdrew from the campaign, declaring he had not accumulated enough support to be competitive.

Eighteen: Buttigieg told The New Yorker that one of his big themes for his campaign will be ""intergenerational justice,"" which he emphasizes shouldn't being about ""generational conflict."" His proposals include abolishing the Electoral College and instituting single-payer health care. He said he's open to statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and appointing more than nine justices to the Supreme Court because ""in some ways it's no more a shattering of norms than what's already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today.""

Nineteen: In the same interview, Buttigieg said he sees his youth and post-Cold War worldview as a strength, primarily a willingness to examine options for the role of government unthinkable to previous generations: ""It is very pragmatic to look around and say, well, the countries that do this tend to be better than the countries that don't. The system we have isn't working very well; we ought to try this other system. Politically, it's never been possible, because it's been considered socialism, and socialism was a kill switch. Our generation did not live through the Cold War in the same way.""

Twenty: Discussing his experience campaigning statewide and attending many county Democratic parties' traditional Jefferson-Jackson dinners, he laments that the events are named after ""two morally problematic men,"" former presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.",149,nationalreview.com,Twenty Things You Probably Didn't Know About Pete Buttigieg | National Review
"The politics of Trump's surprise Golan Heights announcement

President Trump has made yet another move to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Israel, one that may also serve as a political calculation going into 2020, Real Clear Politics co-founder Tom Bevan argued Thursday.

Earlier in the day, Trump declared that the Golan Heights territory belongs to Israel, tweeting that the disputed area has ""critical strategic and security importance"" to the Jewish state.

During Thursday's All-Star panel on Fox News' ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" Bevan -- along with national security analyst Morgan Ortagus and Washington Post opinion writer Charles Lane -- weighed in on the political ramifications of the president's latest declaration.

Bevan began by pointing to the growing list of 2020 candidates who are boycotting the upcoming (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) conference in Washington. The list includes U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, and former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke.

He also noted the anti-Semitism controversy surrounding U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, on which President Trump has commented.

Trump ""has been a big supporter of Israel,"" Bevan told the panel. ""Obviously, this is another issue on which he decided to move forward in part, I think, to draw the contrast between himself, his administration, and whoever his eventual opponent is going to be in 2020. So definitely some domestic politics at play here as well.""

Ortagus called Trump's decision a ""landmark shift"" in U.S. policy toward Israel, as top White House adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are actively working on a ""larger peace initiative"" in the Middle East. She also argued that it's far more beneficial for Israel to claim the Golan Heights than for someone like Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad or any other enemy of Israel to do so.

Lane pointed out the ""politics"" of Trump's decision, telling the panel that it will help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reelection next month. But there's a ""downside"" to Trump's decision, he added: It sets a precedent that the U.S. can ""ignore"" a U.N.

"BANGKOK - More than 70 parties are contesting Sunday's general election in Thailand, the first since a military coup nearly five years ago.

Up for grabs are 500 seats in the House of Representatives, where parties will need to win at least 25 seats to be able to nominate their preferred candidate for prime minister.

The prime minister will be chosen in a joint vote of members of the elected house and the unelected senate, whose 250 members will all be appointed by the junta after the general election.

Size, past performance and buzz suggest just a handful of parties will win enough seats to nominate a candidate.

Prayuth, 65, was a career soldier who made it to the pinnacle of his military career in 2010, when he was appointed army commander in chief.

The job put him in a pivotal position during the long-running and sometimes violent struggle for power between supporters and opponents of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled in a 2006 military coup.

Prayuth went on to lead his own putsch, the May 2014 coup against a government established by Thaksin's sister. Taking over as junta chief and prime minister, and wielding absolute power he granted himself, he cracked down on dissent and moved to prevent a comeback by Thaksin's political machine, primarily by pushing through a new constitution that weakens political parties.

In the past year, Prayuth has made himself over as a politician. But his gruff manner, sharp tongue and short temper raise doubts about his ability to work smoothly within a more democratic framework.

Prayuth is the candidate of the Palang Pracharath party, considered a proxy for the junta's interests. His biggest advantage is the bloc support most expect he will get from the Senate, which he will have appointed.

Sudarat, 57, is the latest stand-in to head a party backed by Thaksin, who lives in exile abroad to avoid a jail sentence but is still a key political player.

The daughter of a former member of parliament from the country's northeast, she was educated at Bangkok's top schools.

She entered politics in 1991, winning a house seat in Bangkok for the reformist Palang Dharma Party, which was also billionaire businessman Thaksin's entryway into politics. In 1994 she became deputy transport minister in a Democrat Party-led coalition government. In 1998, she helped Thaksin found his Thai Rak Thai Party, in which she became deputy leader.

When Thaksin led his party to victory in 2001, she was appointed Public Health Minister, and in 2006 she became Agriculture Minister. After the coup, she was one of 111 Thai Rak Thai party executives banned from politics for five years when a court disbanded the party for breaking election laws.

Sudarat's big advantage is that she is the candidate for Thaksin's flagship Pheu Thai Party -- and Thaksin's parties have won every national election since 2001.

Abhisit, 54, is a former prime minister whose fate has been intertwined with the country's political upheaval.

Born in England and educated at Eton and Oxford, he joined the country's oldest party, the Democrats, in 1992 and assumed the party leadership in 2005.

The Democrats, popular in Bangkok and their southern political strongholds, have been the main opposition party to those of Thaksin. They haven't been able to achieve nationwide electoral success in some time, and rather than compete against Thaksin at the ballot box, the party over the past 13 years has twice chosen to boycott elections.

Abhisit was, however, able to climb to the premiership in a 2008 parliamentary vote that followed another court decision to disband a Thaksin-backed ruling party. His time in office is most remembered for 2010 street protests in which Thaksin's supporters occupied central Bangkok as they demanded new elections.

Over several weeks, violence increasing engulfed the protests as the authorities tried to rein them in. Finally the army launched a full scale armed assault to end the demonstrations. The episode left 91 people dead and more than 2,000 hurt, most of them civilians.

Abhisit and the Democrats lost the next election in landslide to Thaksin's Pheu Thai.

Abhisit has tried to position himself as a potential compromise prime minister for those who don't want a continuation of army-aligned rule or to see another Thaksin-backed party in power.

Anutin, 52, is the least ideological of the major candidates, heading a party that is a regional powerhouse in the rural northeast and known for cutting deals with parties on both side of the political divide.

He is heir to a major construction company fortune, and follows in his father's footsteps in having a hand in both the business and political worlds. The family conglomerate, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction PCL, has a long history of contracts for government mega-projects such as Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport.

He holds an engineering degree from Hofstra University in the United States.

Bhumjai Thai is an offshoot of a former Thaksin-backed party formed by a faction of politicians whose shift in allegiances during political unrest in 2008 allowed Abhisit to become prime minister.

The party gain nationwide appeal by championing liberalization of marijuana laws, clear legalization of ride-sharing services and the easing of repayment terms for student loans.

The party placed third in the last election in 2011, but its place at the center of past political deals makes Anutin a dark horse candidate.

Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, Future Forward Party

Thanathorn, 40, heads a party established last year that has positioned itself as a choice for progressive opponents of military rule.

Thanathorn is a wealthy businessman who was born and raised in Bangkok. Before entering politics, he ran his family's auto parts manufacturing business.

Most of Future Forward's leadership, tapped in large part from the NGO community, is in their 20s and 30s, which has earned the party a large following of young voters.

The party's inexperience and fairly narrow base mean it may not win enough seats to nominate Thanathorn for prime minister, but it could certainly boost any coalition that strives to block Prayuth.",151,Fox News,A look at those jockeying to be Thailand's next leader
"BANGKOK - Thailand heads to the polls Sunday to vote in the country's first general election since the military toppled an elected government in a coup nearly five years ago.

Once the junta was in power, it tore up the constitution and had a new one written that significantly changed the nation's political structure and electoral rules.

Observers say the new system was a designed to limit the power of big political parties like those that dominated past elections and to increase the need for a coalition government. They say it will also give the military's allies an inside track on leading the next government.

A 250-member Senate has been established and all of the senators will be appointees selected by the junta. The junta has said its selections will be revealed after the general election.

The lower house of parliament will consist of 500 members, all of them elected. The majority of members -- 350 -- will represent individual constituencies around the country and be directly elected by voters in those areas. The other 150 will be party list members, selected from slates of candidates designated by each party, with winning seats assigned in rough proportion to the total share of votes each party receives nationwide.

Voters used to cast two ballots, one for their local member of parliament and the other for their political party preference. The process was relatively straightforward and allowed voters to have local loyalties that differed from their national political party allegiances. Under the new system there is just one ballot and the vote for the local member of parliament will also count as one's party preference.

The number of seats allocated to each party is determined by a convoluted formula that handicaps those parties winning the most constituency seats, by putting a soft cap on the number of party list seats it can be awarded. Midsized parties that win fewer constituency seats are compensated with a lesser handicap, with the rationale that parties with substantial yet weaker vote totals deserve representation. In other words, voting for a big party's representatives dilutes the value of one's party list choice, and lowers the number of house seats that party can accumulate. This weakens bigger, more popular parties.

A voter has even less of a voice in picking the prime minister, not just because he or she is indirectly elected by parliament, but because the election is by a joint vote of the elected lower house and the unelected senate. In theory, if all senators vote in a bloc -- say for the military candidate who appointed them -- a prime minister nominee could win the job by getting just 126 votes in the lower house. That means such a nominee would just need to woo 25 percent of the elected members of the house, plus one more, to become prime minister. The prime minister does not need to be a member of parliament.",152,Fox News,New Thai election rules make it hard to trump junta's pick

It is a political rule of thumb that street violence and disorder eventually redounds to the benefit of the party that can put an end to it. Except in rare cases, that is the party in power.

Paris in 2019 is almost certainly not Saint Petersburg in 1917 or Tehran in 1979. French President Emmanuel Macron, two years ago viewed as the great neoliberal hope for saving Europe from the populists and nationalists, was by this past summer extremely unpopular. He has now managed to rally in the polls, giving his party a small but meaningful lead going into this May's Europarliament elections.

One can imagine that in a head-to-head contest, some politician would be able to persuade a majority that Macron is too weak to govern France, that his policy failures are responsible for the chaos, and that ousting him at the polls is the way to restore dignity and calm to the country. But that election is years away, and it's far from clear what figure might emerge to carry that out. Macron, meanwhile, has effectively initiated a ""national dialogue"" and used it to his own political advantage, drowning the French population in a sea of words.

In the meantime, parts of Paris are burning. The Gilet Jaunes seem to be petering out as a movement, their populist roar from forgotten France increasingly overtaken by leftists speaking in their name. Four weeks ago, some Islamo-gauchistes wearing the movement's trademark yellow vests shouted crude anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic slogans at 69-year-old Alain Finkielkraut and seemed on the verge of assaulting him before police intervened. Not that it should matter, but Finkielkraut was one of the handful of prominent French intellectuals who had spoken favorably about the Gilet Jaunes when the movement began.

The number of Gilet Jaunes at traffic circles and in demonstrations has decreased with each passing week. Fatigue is a factor, but the demonstrations have also been subject to extremely rough treatment by the French police. Particularly fearsome have been the heavy use of so-called flashballs, non-lethal rubber projectiles fired by the riot police. As of last month, 20 people had lost eyes, and there have been hundreds of serious head injuries.

By increasing the fear factor, police have surely lowered the number willing to participate in demonstrations, while raising the outrage of those who do take to the streets. Today's Gilet Jaunes protesters are thus less numerous and more violent. This past Saturday the group returned to Paris in some force, their ranks swelled with the so-called casseurs, or black blocs, hard-left agitators. They blended in with the Gilet Jaunes, using them as human shields, occasionally emerging to attack the cops, burn shops, and scrawl communist and anarchist slogans. They broke down the security gates of the famous and pricey brasserie Le Fouquet on the Champs- √âlys√©es, sacked the restaurant, and then firebombed it. They also set fire to a half-dozen newspaper kiosques -- small businesses that run on very tight margins.

At this point, the French press recognizes that the Gilet Jaunes aren't responsible for the majority of the violence, but their demonstrations do facilitate it. Who is responsible then? Eric Delbecque, author of the recently published book Les Ingouvernables on the far left and violent ultra-left, describes their strategy like this: ""the black blocs are not a movement but a mode of operation. Their goal is to wage an information war, with the following goals: demonstrate their power to inflict violence, provoke the police into incidents which can be used to spread charges of police brutality."" Delbecque says they are ideologically a mixed bag of anarchists and zadistes (a term used for militant ecologists who violently ""defend zones"" against commercial and official encroachment).

It's the violence that's key. Delbecque observes that the violent left was able to remain somewhat untracked by authorities in recent years because so much manpower has been devoted to monitoring radical Islamists. He fears the coming of ""leopard France"" -- a situation where the French state gradually cedes pockets (spots) of its sovereignty to Islamists or far leftists. (I first heard this term in relation to Vietnam when it arose in various ceasefire proposals wherein the Viet Cong would be allowed to retain authority in certain zones, so-called ""leopard spots."")

In any case, the police estimated that there were 1,500 casseurs active in Paris last weekend. It's not a small number. The broader Gilets Jaunes phenomenon has unfolded quite distinctly from the unrest the French establishment really fears: violence from the immigrant populated suburbs close to Paris. Thus far, the youth of Seine-Saint-Denis haven't joined in any meaningful way in Gilets Jaunes protests, and one occasionally reads comments from suburban notables along the lines of ""if blacks did that in Paris, the police would massacre them."" That's surely not the case, but it's undeniable that the highly unlikely fusion of the remaining Gilets Jaunes, the hard-left casseurs, and the suburban lumpenproletariat would be genuinely terrifying to the French authorities.

In any case, what the Gilets Jaunes represent in French politics has evolved. Once an unexpected cry of pain from the peripheral France hurt by globalization and ignored by the French governing class, supported at least tacitly by a large majority of the French, it has become a more standard left-wing movement, shouting redistributionist slogans and now in some instances blended with the violent ultra-left. Last November, on French social media, a video circulated of a couple of hundred Gilet Jaunes reaching a local entente with a squad of riot cops; the slogan shouting stopped and both groups joined together to sing the French national anthem. Such an interlude is difficult to imagine today.

Even though Macron retreated on the regressive carbon tax that ignited the initial protests, the underlying class problem that gave birth to the Gilets Jaunes remains unaddressed. Simply put, more working class people in France are poor and struggling to get by than at any time in the postwar era, while many in the prosperous cities are doing just fine.

The safest prediction is that the demonstrations will soon stop. The government will forbid demonstrations in certain sensitive areas like the Champs-√âlys√©es and a crackdown will be widely viewed as unavoidable. Macron's party will emerge slightly stronger in the coming Europarliament elections than if the Gilet Jaunes had never happened, and the economic gap between Macron's France and the Gilets Jaunes' France will continue to grow. Some Gilets Jaunes activists will move into electoral politics, without obvious effect. It isn't a happy outcome if you believe neoliberalism doesn't have the answers to the crisis that's been generated by its own policies.",153,The American Conservative,How Emmanuel Macron Outlasted The Yellow Vests
"Forget race: the real dividing line is class, with identity politics there to distract us into submission.

""See, in America we have this thing about 'people of color.' POC. I think you're one."" That was me explaining all things American to a visitor. He was actually from Spain, so he was Spanish, not Hispanic. We were trying to figure out whether he was a POC.

This was not some sort of intellectual Sudoku to pass the time; this POC idea underpins the core strategy of the Democratic Party. The U.S. is poised to become a non-majority nation (""minority white"") within 25 years, meaning about half of the country will be POC. The Democratic Party believes these POC will vote for their candidates, while the Republican Party withers away cherry picking votes from the dwindling basket of deplorable whites.

My Spanish friend considered himself European. ""So I guess I am white, yes?"" he offered. His skin was clearly a few shades darker than mine, though he pointed out that was only because my relatives came from the cold part of Europe and he came from the sunny part. But he spoke Spanish. At least in America, my new friend qualified as a POC.

His Seamless order arrived. He said gracias to the delivery guy and handed over a one dollar tip. ""What do I have in common with him?"" the Spaniard asked, ""except the rudimentary ability to speak the same language, same as 560 million others?"" I rolled my eyes at the delivery guy, a universal gesture of ""people don't tip, right?"" solidarity.

I noted to my friend as I pulled into traffic, heading back to his hotel, that the Democrats in 2020 would likely have at least a POC vice presidential candidate, one who ""looked like him."" But the whole POC thing did not sit well. Why, he asked, do Americans want leaders who physically look like them? ""Didn't it used to be wrong to judge people by the color of their skin?"" he said. ""Why is it okay to choose someone because they're black but racist to choose someone because they aren't?"" I noted that in 2019, a candidate named Richard who graduated from Columbia needed to go around saying ""call me Beto"" to lighten his whiteness.

Things really got confusing when I explained that a newly arrived Chinese migrant and a 70-year-old Mexican American CEO and people from Trinidad, Ghana, and the Bronx with three different levels of education were all seen as having something inherently in common. And they all had something inherently not in common with everyone tainted by various shades of pink.

I mentioned reparations. Until slavery was ended in the United States, human beings were legally considered capital, just like owning stocks and bonds today. But the Spaniard knew enough about history to wonder what reparations would be offered to the thousands of Chinese treated as animals to build the railroads or the 8,000 Irish who died digging the New Basin Canal or the whole families of Jews living on the Lower East Side of New York who were forced to employ their children to make clothing for uptown ""white"" stores. Later in the same century, wages were ""voluntarily"" cut to the bone at factories in Ohio to save jobs that disappeared anyway after the owners had wrung out the last profits.

The more we talked, the more it all seemed to be about labor, low paid or never paid (economically, they exist on a spectrum), rather than the C of the P doing the work. Whatever racial inequality exists today, that doesn't change the fact that for 90 percent of us, race isn't a major issue. It was like we were missing the thing behind the thing. Or someone was trying to hide it.

""I think,"" my friend said, ""Americans spend so much time worried about race they miss what we Europeans understand in our bones. It is class which divide societies. Look at Britain, once nearly 100 percent white, yet a person had to say just a few words before you knew who worked for who by the accent. Or India, where everyone is a POC as you Americans would say, and where they created a caste system that survived the departure of the white people.""

It does seem silly to think a Caucasian on food stamps in West Virginia has more in common with a Caucasian in Los Angeles producing multimillion-dollar movies than a black person on food stamps in, say, West Virginia again. ""No, your Democrats are drawing the lines the wrong way,"" said the Spaniard. ""It is about money, not melanin."" We had to look up the last word from the Spanish melanina.

After driving for a while, we arrived at The Plaza. My Spanish friend paid me for the ride through the Uber app, but with a generous cash tip. Privilege, I guess. I pocketed the $10.**

As I set off to my other job, the idea of money as a dividing line started to make more sense and the idea of POC started to make less. Color masks the lines that really matter, and those lines are all colored green.

Since 1980, the incomes of the very rich (the 1 percent) have grown faster than the economy, about a 400 percent cumulative increase. The upper middle class (the 9.9 percent) kept pace with the economy. The other 90 percent fell behind. Race? You can be confident that the 1 percent are mostly white; likely the 9.9 percent, too. But the other 90 percent of America is every color. Whether your housing is subsidized via a mortgage tax deduction or Section 8, you're still depending on the people in charge to allow you a place to live.

The birth lottery determines which of those three bands we'll sink or swim together in, because there is precious little mobility. In that bottom band, 81 percent face flat or falling net worths (40 percent of Americans make below $15 an hour) and so aren't going anywhere. Education, once a vehicle, is now mostly a tool for the preservation of current statuses across generations, to the point that it's worth paying bribes for. Class is sticky.

Money, not so much. Since the 9.9 percent have the most (except for the super wealthy at least), they have the most to lose. At their peak in the mid-1980s, the managers and technicians in this group held 35 percent of the nation's wealth. Three decades later, that fell 12 percent, exactly as much as the wealth of the 1 percent rose. A significant redistribution of wealth -- upwards -- took place following the 2008 market collapse, as bailouts, shorts, repossessions, and new laws helped the top end of the economy at cost to the bottom. What some label hardships are to others business opportunities.

The people at the top are throwing nails off the back of the truck to make sure no one else can catch up with them. There is a strong zero sum element to all this. The goal is to eliminate the competition. They'll have it all when society is down to two classes, the 1 percent and the 99 percent, and at that point we'll all be effectively the same color. The CEO of JP Morgan called it a bifurcated economy. Historians will recognize it as feudalism.

You'd think someone would sound a global climate change-level alarm about all this. Instead we divide people into tribes and make them afraid of each other by forcing competition for limited resources like health care. Identity politics sharpens the lines, recognizing increasingly smaller separations, like adding letters to LGBTQQIAAP.

Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, herself with presidential ambitions, is an example of the loud voices demanding more division. Contrast that with early model Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, who pleaded, ""There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.""

The divisions can always be jacked up. ""My opponent is a white nationalist!"" and so he doesn't just think you're lazy, he wants to kill you. Convince average Americans to vote against their own interests by manipulating them into opposing any program that might benefit black and brown equally or more than themselves. Keep the groups fighting left and right and they'll never notice the real discrimination is up and down, even as massive economic forces consume all equally. Consumption becomes literal as Americans die from alcohol, drugs, and suicide in record numbers.

Meanwhile, no one has caught on to the fact that identity politics is a marketing tool for votes, fruit flavored vape to bring in the kiddies. Keep that in mind as you listen to the opening cries of the 2020 election. Listen for what's missing in the speeches about inequality and injustice. Whichever candidate admits that we've created an apartheid of dollars for all deserves your support.

"Trump directed his Cabinet agencies to tie federal grants for education and research to more aggressive enforcement of the First Amendment; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports.

President Trump's signing of an executive order Thursday that requires colleges and universities to support free speech or face the loss of federal funding calls needed attention to the serious problem of campus censorship.

The president invited more than 100 conservative students to the signing ceremony. On many campuses, conservative speech has faced unjustified and improper restrictions.

""Under the guise of speech codes, safe spaces and trigger warnings, these universities have tried to restrict free thought, impose total conformity and shut down the voices of great young Americans like those here today,"" President Trump said

""These ideas are dangerous,"" the president said. ""Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus.""

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROMOTE FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

Students at the signing ceremony have personal stories of being targeted or censored for their conservative beliefs on campus. I know their stories well.

I have spent the past five years traveling to college campuses across the country to organize, recruit, and train conservative students. I have been spat on, shoved and threatened with violence. I was once even licked by a man claiming to have Ebola after leaving Oakland State University's free speech zone during a Hillary Clinton speaking engagement. Seriously.

But my experience pales in comparison to what conservative students face on a daily basis. Free speech zones, speech codes, safe spaces, repressive speech fees, aggressive administrations and outright violence have become the norm for them.

If we let the minds of an entire generation atrophy to mush in an environment with little or no competition of ideas, then we will have failed as a society.

There are, in fact, hundreds of examples of leftist repression of conservatives throughout the years. But the recent assault of Hayden Williams at the University of California, Berkeley has raised the alarm about suppression of free speech on campuses to a whole new level.

While conservatives like Williams have been in the spotlight, the real beneficiaries of President Trump's executive order are all of the students who may not even know their free speech rights are being suppressed on their campus.

That means everyone else on college campuses - the wide-eyed students eager to change the world, the apathetic students who don't yet have a political ideology, and the left-leaning ones who already do. They are the ones who have not been taught to use their words effectively when confronted with alternative ideas, which is why we see many of them resort to using their fists instead.

The irony of the Berkeley incident is that the man who threw the punch at Williams may land in jail, while Williams has been praised by the president of the United States and will surely have a host of career opportunities thrust in his face.

So who is the true victim of the free speech problem that has consumed college campuses? Who came through that atmosphere of hostility equipped with tolerance and the ability to handle alternative ideas? Hayden Williams did.

By turning higher education into a carefully curated and comfortable echo chamber for some students, all students are being robbed of fundamental life skills. Peaceful disagreement, conflict resolution, and critical thought have been discarded, only to be replaced by trigger warnings and ""hate speech designations.""

College used to be a place where students could expect to be taught to flex their mental muscles. It was reasonable to assume they would have their most closely held beliefs challenged daily, and might even change their minds from time to time.

There were no ""safe spaces"" for them to hide from words or ideas with which they disagreed - and they were better for it. College was hard, it was scary, and it made people mentally stronger.

With overzealous administrators desperate to compete for more students by making campus the equivalent of a pillow factory, we have lost the intellectual rigor needed to forge critical thinkers out of impressionable young people.

By turning higher education into a carefully curated and comfortable echo chamber for some students, all students are being robbed of fundamental life skills. Peaceful disagreement, conflict resolution, and critical thought have been discarded, only to be replaced by trigger warnings and ""hate speech designations.""

With their consistent repression of dissenting speech from conservative students, college administrators are all but guaranteeing that their students will never have to do the intellectual grunt work necessary to build the skills needed to deal with the inevitable disagreements they will experience in the real world.

All students, regardless of their political affiliations, are being scammed by institutions of higher learning when they are coddled into inadequacy by all-too-eager-to-please liberal administrators.

Every college and university has an obligation to provide students with an education - not an indoctrination.

It is unfortunate that an executive order from the president is even needed to force administrators to adhere to the First Amendment of the Constitution - but it is an absolute necessity, given the alternative.

A recent study by the Brookings Institution shows that student opinion on the application of the First Amendment is at an all-time low. According to the poll, 51 percent of students agreed that it is acceptable to shout down a speaker on campus, and 19 percent of students consider violence an acceptable means of silencing an opposing view.

According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, 129 schools in the U.S. currently have ""at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech"" and 282 schools have policies that ""restrict a more limited amount of protected expression or, by virtue of their vague wording, could too easily be used to restrict protected expression.""

College administrators are supposed to know better. They are supposed to be the ones writing the policies that promote the free expression of ideas - not limit it. The fact they have demonstrated time and again that they won't rise to their responsibility as educators left President Trump with little choice but to compel them to do so.

In the face of changing technology - which is providing Americans with the unprecedented ability to almost entirely insulate themselves from information they don't like - higher education has more of a responsibility than ever to serve as a free marketplace of ideas.

Members of Generation Z have the potential to follow their millennial counterparts into the comfortable numbness of carefully curated online echo chambers and intellectual stagnation. They will not be presented with an opposing idea unless they actively search for it (something that is becoming increasingly difficult in the face of Big Tech censorship).

As a result, many young people will never develop the ability to effectively deal with an idea they don't like.

In all too many cases, exposure to opposing views results in a desperate, violent and senseless meltdown more suited to barbaric children than civilized adults. It is time that the real adults in the room did something to level the playing field again so that good old-fashioned disagreements can happen without fear of violence and intimidation.

If we let the minds of an entire generation atrophy to mush in an environment with little or no competition of ideas, then we will have failed as a society.

President Trump is right. Schools that promote and enforce policies that directly contradict this country's highest and most cherished laws don't deserve taxpayer funding. In fact, it is the responsibility of the executive branch to make sure the Constitution and our laws are enforced.

"MILAN - Chinese President Xi Jinping, in an editorial charm offensive published Wednesday in one of Italy's leading newspapers, said Chinese youth love pizza and tiramisu. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe is not loving much at all about Xi's visit to Italy.

The term ""Trojan horse"" has been bandied about.

Italy appears set to break ranks with the rest of the G-7 by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to join China's famous ""Belt and Road"" Initiative. That's a $6 trillion scheme to link East and West for the purpose of enhancing the flow of Chinese goods through international markets.

China has already invested in Italy and all over Europe, but this latest move is different because it legitimizes a project that some critics have said could risk colonizing Europe.

And it has clearly angered Washington, which has called Belt and Road a ""vanity project"" amid an ongoing trade war with China.

Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte claimed those concerns were misguided. ""The framework of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road is purely economic and commercial; it does not remotely put into doubt our Euro-Atlantic alliance,"" Conte said.

Italy is in a recession. After the collapse of the Morandi Bridge in Genoa that killed 43 people last year, the nation lashed out at the European Union for constraining its budget. It makes some sense that Rome would ultimately turn to Beijing for help.

If it makes good on the MOU with China, big investment is expected in the ports of Trieste and Genoa.

For its part, China buys more than pizza and tiramisu.

In his editorial, Xi also said, ""Italian fashion and furnishings meet the taste of Chinese consumers."" That is an understatement. China is, in fact, one of the biggest consumers of Italian luxury goods, so Italy is hoping the Belt and Road will flow profitably both ways.

But professor Francesco Sisci, a senior researcher at Renmin University of China, said it's not that simple.

ITALY'S SENATE REFUSES TO LIFT SALVINI'S IMMUNITY IN MIGRANT CASE

""This government is thinking very simply. We have little trade with China. It's time to make up with China. Very, very simple. But international politics are never so straightforward,"" Sisci said. ""There is a bigger picture and they apparently fail even to see the bigger picture.""

The Chinese delegation to Italy is 500 strong. Xi wrote of his hopes that China and Italy can develop cooperation projects in such matters as ports, shipping, telecoms and pharmaceuticals, and encourage respective companies to operate in their countries.

The Chinese president also said he wants to ""reinforce coordination between China and Italy in international bodies"" like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Again, Europe has done plenty of business with China, but this Chinese push into Italy comes at a time when Brussels wants to apply the brakes a bit to Beijing's frenzy of activity on the continent.

But there are gaps in the message.

Germany has not excluded the possibility of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei furnishing it with 5-G technology. And Italy originally took the same position, though recently, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the loudest voice in Italy's coalition government, has pushed back against such a possibility, saying he does ""not want his data going through Beijing.""

Salvini may ultimately slow his country's march into China's arms to an extent.

""The only constraints are security, the control of Italians' data and energy,"" he said. ""I would not like someone to wake up on the other side of the world and turn off the switch.""

In his editorial, Xi paid homage to history and ""his dear Italian friends,"" recalling Marco Polo, who set off the first real passion for China.

They differ among themselves about Donald Trump, but they are in agreement that what comes after Trump can't be a return to what came before him on the right, and that it must involve a commitment to family, faith, work, community, and country.

It's a promising and heartening statement of principles. And it points to an important fact about the various divisions and distinctions on the right that can easily be obscured by the huge 'yes' or 'no' question about Trump that now distracts everyone from everything. In the decade and more before 2016, some conservatives had begun expressing dissatisfaction with a Republican Party that had lost itself in tired, libertarian slogans, and that too often offered only rote repetitions of the ends of Ronald Reagan's sentences without much thought to how or why they started. We thought the party had lost its sense of the essence of American life, and that it offered too little of substance to help working families. It had exhausted its spirit and its agenda, and had not found a way to revitalize.

I think Donald Trump is the culmination of that exhaustion -- its living embodiment as an elderly, exploitative narcissist who appeals to voters' resentments but not their aspirations, who gives the appearance of intense activity while achieving very little, and who is ultimately unfit to govern. Some of my friends think Trump is actually the solution to that exhaustion -- that by shattering the old shibboleths he means to force a necessary reckoning and is achieving what others couldn't. That's a serious difference of opinion, but it also masks a deeper agreement that the status quo that preceded 2016 was not worthy or sustainable and that (especially given the growing perversity of the left) the right in America needs to recover its commitment to the foundations of the good life -- family, community, faith, work, and country -- and to protect and reinforce those through a politics rooted in the ends articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the means put forward in the Constitution. Whether Trump advances or retards that cause is an important source of division at this point. But that this should be our cause is a more important source of agreement in the long run.

To be critical of Donald Trump is not to yearn for what preceded him, and to be supportive of him is not to be content with what he offers. There is more to be sought and worked for. And this statement offers an appealing example of what that could involve.",157,nationalreview.com,What the Right Is For | National Review

"Success in politics -- and in political predictions -- ¬≠depends on the ability to distinguish between old rules of thumb that don't apply anymore and old rules of thumb that do.

Take the old rule that an officeholder's chances of re-election depend on what James Carville in 1992 took to calling ""the economy, stupid.""

That used to be a real thing. The Great Depression took President Herbert Hoover down from 58 percent of the vote in 1928 to 40 percent in 1932. The return of economic growth enabled President Franklin Roosevelt to increase his 57 percent in 1932 to 61 percent in 1936 and then to win re-election twice in the shadow of world war in the 1940s.

Amid recession, President Ronald Reagan's job approval sunk to 41 percent in January 1983. Amid surging growth, it rose to 58 percent in October 1984. A month later, he won 59 percent of the popular vote and carried 49 states.

During President Trump's time in office so far, the American economy has improved sharply, with record-low unemployment and -- something not seen since Reagan's time or before -- with the biggest income gains for low earners. The public's rating of the economy has improved sharply as well.

But Trump's job approval has barely changed at all. After hitting a low of 37 percent in the RealClearPolitics average of public polls in December 2017, it has ¬≠remained steady for more than a year, oscillating between 40 and 44 percent.

Analysts have attributed wobbles upward or downward to specific events. But given the inexactitude inevitable in polling, they may not represent any change at all. Trump's numbers remain slightly below the high 40s, the pre-election-year approval numbers of recent presidents who have won a second term. But their approval numbers were closely tied to perceptions of the economy. Trump's aren't.

One reason old political rules stop working is that one generation of voters has different experiences from those of the generations before.

Voters who remembered the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s rewarded incumbent presidents who seemed to have produced prosperity and peace with landslide re-elections.

They were willing to cross party lines to express their gratitude for policies that seemed to prevent the horrors that were all too ¬≠familiar.

So incumbent presidents of both parties won between 57 and 61 percent of the popular vote in 1956, 1964, 1972 and 1984. Since 1988, only a shrinking sliver of voters remembers what Americans used to call ""the depression"" and ""the war,"" and no president has won more than 53 percent.

Just as Trump hasn't been able to raise his job rating to the improving economy, so his political enemies have not been able to lower it significantly. Each new supposedly shocking personal revelation has failed to shock; each eagerly whispered allegation of criminal collusion has failed to disenchant.

It's apparent now that Trump's support -- the 21st-century Republican core minus a couple million white college grads, plus a couple million white non-grads -- is sticking with him pretty much regardless of events or outcomes. And that the coalition that makes up the 21st-century Democrats, with the reverse adjustments, is solidly arrayed against.

This is actually in line with old political rules, rules with origins far before the 1930s and 1940s. The Republican Party, from its formation in 1854, has been built around a core of people considered to be ordinary Americans but not by themselves a majority. The Democratic Party, from its formation in 1832, has been a coalition of those regarded as out-peoples, often at odds with one another but together often a majority.

Both parties' voters today are acting characteristically. The vast body of Republicans has no truck with the plaints of Never Trumpers. The Democrats are in turmoil, panicking at the possibility of having enemies on the left, to the point that House Democrats at first couldn't pass a resolution decrying the blatant anti-Semitism of one of their own.

So we see multiple presidential candidates racing to embrace programs with 8 to 20-some percent support in the general electorate -- racial reparations, ninth-month abortions, tearing down existing border walls, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

We see eminences, hoarse from denouncing Trump for violating longstanding norms, now advocating the abolishment of the Electoral College; packing the ¬≠Supreme Court; enacting the 16-year-old vote and the Green New Deal, with its abolition of gas-powered automobiles and flatulent cattle.

Old rules of thumb, it seems, can yield to even older ones.",159,New York Post,Why a strong economy isn't boosting Trump's approval ratings

"President Trump responded positively to a suggestion by a conservative reporter that social media platforms that fail to remain politically neutral should lose their privileged legal position, which affords them immunity from lawsuits for user-generated content. But the President's own trade bill, USMCA, actually strengthens that immunity, as previously reported by Breitbart News.

""We have to do something"" said the President. ""It seems to be if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, there's discrimination.""

""We have to do something about it. It's a very, very dangerous situation, so I agree, something has to be looked at very closely,"" the President concluded in response to the Daily Caller's question about reforming tech platform's legal immunities.

The immunities referred to are contained in the Communications Decency Act under Section 230. The Act grants tech platforms exemption from legal liability for user-generated content, meaning that a tech company like Twitter or Facebook can't be sued over law-breaking material that users post on their platforms. This privilege is granted, according to the Act, in part because tech platforms provide ""a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.""

However, the Act provides no guide on what to do if tech platforms fail to provide a forum for political diversity, as they are increasingly doing. Moreover, it also specifically allows tech platforms to remove or censor user content that the platforms consider ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.""

It also gives them a second legal immunity for such acts of censorship, ensuring that users will have extreme difficulty taking the tech giants to court if their content is unfairly removed. Tech platforms today are akin to a landlord who's legally allowed to knock your house down with no notice and no compensation.

But here's the big problem for President Trump -- he says he wants to tackle Big Tech bias, but his own flagship trade bill, USMCA, contains language that actually strengthens this legal immunity, giving tech platforms even more leeway to censor and imposing the same system on trade partners Mexico and Canada. Commerce Department officials say that the treaty merely ensures that U.S. platforms will not be held liable in Mexico or Canada for actions shielded by U.S. law.

USMCA contains a modified version of the same legal immunities in Section 230. Only this time, it gives tech platforms a broad immunity to censor any material they consider ""objectionable or harmful."" Thus far, some lawyers have argued that the word ""objectionable"" in Section 230 only applies to the preceding list of items (obscene, harassing, etc). Yet USMCA only refers to ""objectionable or harmful,"" thus giving tech platforms broad leeway to interpret these highly subjective terms at will.

If President Trump is serious about tackling tech bias -- and he sounds like he is -- he should start by examining his own trade bill.",162,Breitbart,"Bokhari: Trump Talks Tough on Social Media Bias, but USMCA Makes Censorship Easier | Breitbart"
"It seems the only sure thing about this year's state budget is that it will sock taxpayers yet again -- even as state leaders flush yet new billions down the drain.

Facing slim odds lawmakers would legalize marijuana by the March 31 budget deadline, Gov. Cuomo on Tuesday pulled his pot sales tax from his spending plan. To replace it, he's backing a pied-√†-terre surcharge (on city condos and coops over $5 million).

Experts say it's risky to rely on revenue from a pied-√†-terre tax, which anyway should go to the city, not the state.

But lawmakers figure it'll mostly hit wealthy out-of-towners, so they'll be spared voters' wrath. Politics trumps common sense.

And taxpayers will likely get hit twice. After all, if marijuana is OK'd later, as Cuomo expects, it's sure to be taxed. Think lawmakers will then repeal the pied-√†-terre tax? Ha!

Cuomo also wants a new ""congestion"" tax: tolls on drivers below 61st Street in Manhattan. And an Internet sales tax. And another five years of the millionaires tax .‚Äâ.‚Äâ.

Here's the scariest part: With more than a week left before the deadline, who knows what other new taxes they'll tack on?

Yet even with all the cash pouring in, Albany faces a budget squeeze. Cuomo warns that the Senate wants to shell out $3 billion beyond what he's budgeted. To help cover that spending, he suggested scrapping $420 million a year in handouts to film moguls.

""The Senate is against tax credits, right? That was their position on Amazon,"" Cuomo chided. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they proposed cutting the film tax credit."" Sadly, he was mainly just zinging Amazon foe Sen. Michael Gianaris.

Still, Cuomo claimed he'd ax the Hollywood credits himself, rather than cut education or health care. Why not both?

The giveaways for film folks do absolutely nothing to create permanent jobs in New York. And the state also wastes a fortune on health care and schools (on which it shells out twice the US per-student average).

Alas, with Democrats now fully in charge, Albany's tax-and-spend habits are only getting worse. Brace for impact.",163,New York Post,The only sure thing about NY's next budget is that the taxpayers will
"BRUSSELS -- Worn down by three years of indecision in London, European Union leaders on Thursday grudgingly offered the U.K. more time to ease itself out of the bloc, delaying by several weeks -- but not eliminating -- the threat of a chaotic British exit.

After a meeting that stretched through the afternoon and over dinner, the bloc said Britain could postpone its departure, due on March 29, until May 22 -- if the U.K. Parliament approves Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal with the bloc next week.

If the twice-rejected deal is thrown out again, the bloc says Britain has until April 12 to ""indicate a way forward."" May agreed to the plan, European Council President Donald Tusk said.

The deep uncertainty among leaders at an EU summit in Brussels was exceeded only by the high anxiety being felt by politicians, businesses and citizens in Britain. The British military has even set up a command post in a bunker under the defense ministry in London to help coordinate ""no-deal"" planning.

Thursday's summit opened with ominous warnings from EU leaders about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

French President Emmanuel Macron warned it was the responsibility of U.K. lawmakers to approve a Brexit deal and make sure Britain does not crash out of the bloc without an agreement.

""In case of a 'no' vote ... it will guide everybody to a no-deal for sure,"" Macron cautioned. ""This is it.""

The House of Commons is split, both among and within its political parties, over whether and how to leave the EU. It has twice rejected the deal Prime Minister Theresa May brokered with the bloc's leaders late last year.

""We are all waiting, waiting for what the British intend to do,"" said EU Parliament President Antonio Tajani. ""We are all concerned.""

This week, May finally acknowledged the Brexit gridlock and asked the EU to delay Britain's departure until June 30 -- enough time, she hopes, to win parliamentary approval for her deal in a third attempt and then pass the legislation necessary for a smooth departure.

But opposition to May's the agreement among British politicians appeared to be hardening, rather than softening, after she blamed Parliament for the Brexit impasse.

In a televised address Wednesday night, May accused lawmakers of ""infighting,"" ''political games"" and ""arcane procedural rows,"" but acknowledged no personal error in creating the deadlock.

A lawmaker from May's Conservative Party called the speech ""toxic."" Legislator Anna Soubry, of the breakaway Independent Group, described it as the ""most dishonest and divisive statement from any prime minister.""

In response, May hunkered down, calling on lawmakers to back her agreement and refusing to rule out a no-deal exit if they did not back her.

""What matters is that we recognize that Brexit is the decision of the British people. We need to deliver on that,"" May said as she arrived in Brussels. ""I sincerely hope that will be with a negotiated deal.""

Businesses and economists say a no-deal Brexit would cause huge disruptions and billions in costs to the economies of both Britain and the EU.

Underscoring the sense of dread gripping the nation, one of Britain's biggest business lobbies and a major trade union federation said in a rare joint appeal that the ""country is facing a national emergency.""

The Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress warned May that if Britain crashes out of the EU, ""the shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come.""

Britain's military said the command post under the ministry of defense was set up as a continuation of earlier planning operations, called Operation Redfold, designed to minimize disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The ministry said in a statement it had 3,500 troops on standby to help with any disruptions if the government asks for assistance.

Worry about a chaotic departure is rising among EU leaders, who fear May no longer has the clout in Parliament to get her way.

""Nobody wants no-deal here,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to work ""until the last hour"" to try to ensure that Britain doesn't leave without a deal, even though her government has enacted emergency measures to deal with such a scenario.

May plans to make a third attempt to get her deal through Parliament next week. But many pro-Brexit legislators still oppose it, saying it does not deliver the clean break they long for. And Pro-EU lawmakers will try to derail May and wrest away control of the Brexit process to steer Britain toward a close relationship with the bloc.

It's a struggle that has been going on for almost three years and has brought the U.K. to within eight days of a chaotic Brexit.

EU leaders are watching with disbelief, horror -- and, for some, sympathy.

""I never got frustrated with Theresa May. I have the highest respect for her,"" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. ""Her tenacity is enormous. But she is working in an extremely difficult situation.

""It's not her mistake that we are where we are -- it's because too many people have so far played party politics on this issue.""",164,New York Post,European Union leaders offer UK more time to delay Brexit

Many also want to eliminate the Electoral College, likely as ""a forerunner to getting rid of the Senate itself"" in favor of a majoritarian system where ""a party could sweep into power and implement a radical agenda without much resistance."" Instead of returning to more stable politics, Democrats are using Trumpism ""as an excuse to ¬≠embrace radicalism.""

Political scribe: What Early Dem $ Numbers Don't Capture

The huge first-day fundraising totals released by Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke ""are great signs for both candidates,"" suggesting both have ""passionate, intense supporters,"" says FiveThirtyEight's Perry Bacon. But there's one thing those number don't necessarily show: ""broad support or diverse support."" First off, the number of individual donors (348,000 between them) is only ""a fraction of a fraction of the total number of Democratic-leaning voters."" And while we don't have specific data, past campaigns suggest it's very likely those donors ""are disproportionately upper-income, well-educated and white."" Other metrics we use in the early campaign stages ""are also skewed in ways that overrepresent voters with more money and education."" So ""pay attention to the numbers,"" but ""keep their limitations in mind.""

Media critic: After 40 Years, a Contrary View of C-SPAN

The universal fanfare and acclaim that greeted C-SPAN's 40th anniversary this week ""is astonishing,"" asserts The Atlantic's David Graham. But ""anytime so many people agree about something, there's usually reason for suspicion."" Granted, the cable channel has much to recommend it, but ""like every silver cloud, it isn't without a dark lining."" In C-SPAN's case, it's that ""politicians love it for the chance to grandstand."" Which raises the question: ""What if C-SPAN is not an anachronism, but an author of today's political chaos"" -- because instead of no one watching, as the standard joke goes, too many are tuning in? And because ""the ability to speak live on TV to the nation"" without any editorial intervention ""makes politics less about achieving things directly and more about scoring points.""

Historian: Naming Running Mate Now Is a Terrible Idea

Reports say Joe Biden will not only jump into the presidential race but also name his running mate right out of the gate. That's been done a couple of times before, notes William Adler at A House Divided, ""but it's never worked in the past."" In fact, it either backfired (Ronald Reagan naming Richard Schweiker) or was seen as ""a sign of desperation"" (Ted Cruz naming Carly Fiorina). For one thing, predicting who would be the most helpful running mate this far out ""is likely to be a fool's errand."" Besides, most people don't ""vote based on the identity of the #2 position on the ticket,"" except negatively in a rare case, like Sarah Palin. And that's in the general election; ""we have no idea how primary voters would respond, if at all, to a full ticket running together.""

A leftward shift among prosecutors in America's largest cities, including New York, has become ""a race to the bottom,"" argues City Journal's Rafael Mangual. Increasingly, their ""bad ideas and misguided assumptions"" could ""jeopardize the public-safety gains of the 1990s and 2000s."" Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez's ""Justice 2020"" plan, for example, is predicated on the notion that New York City over-incarcerates. Already, though, less than 2 percent of annual arrests result in a prison sentence, and 75 percent of inmates are repeat offenders. Which means ""there just isn't much room for further decarceration in New York without releasing chronic and often violent offenders.""

"Bachelet, who as President of Chile maintained warm diplomatic relations with the Maduro regime, highlighted the ""dramatically deteriorating economic and social rights"" of Venezuelan citizens, amid a time of political and economic crisis that has left millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance.

In a statement Wednesday, Bachelet confirmed her office had sent human rights observers into Venezuela to investigate reports of ""possible extrajudicial executions"" by regime security forces against political dissidents.

""It appears that some of these killings have followed a similar pattern,"" she said. ""They take place during illegal house raids carried out by the FAES, which subsequently reports the death as resulting from an armed confrontation - although witnesses report the victims were unarmed.""

""I am also concerned about increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and of the press in Venezuela, and the allegations that the authorities have arbitrarily used the law against hatred, adopted in November 2017, to prosecute journalists, opposition leaders and anyone expressing dissenting opinions,"" she continued.

However, Bachelet also criticized sanctions imposed by the United States targeting the Maduro regime's access to financial resources, arguing that they are also hurting the Venezuelan people. Nearly three million people have fled the country since 2015, placing extra pressure on neighboring Latin American countries such as Colombia and Brazil.

""I am concerned that the recent sanctions on financial transfers related to the sale of Venezuelan oil within the United States may contribute to aggravating the economic crisis, with possible repercussions on people's basic rights and wellbeing,"" she said.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Carrie Filipetti said that the sanctions were not intended to harm the Venezuelan people but instead an attempt to instigate a democratic transition in the crisis-stricken country.

""We have tried to target our sanctions as much as possible so that it can affect the regime but leave the individual Venezuelans as untouched as possible,"" she told reporters.

"On March 19, news broke that Democratic presidential candidates will participate in a special debate exclusively focused on LGBT issues in October, right as the election heats up. According to progressive gay-news site The Advocate, this forum will focus on ""on the lives and rights of LGBTQ people"" and offer ""a chance to educate the potential next president"" on ""the challenges still facing queer Americans."" This might sound nice to some, but it's a miserable idea.

Like much of what's pushed by progressive LGBT advocates, this forum is a purely symbolic gesture that exemplifies the natural consequences of identity politics run amok. Pleasant buzzwords aside, an LGBT-only presidential debate is entirely pointless and only serves to distract from more pressing issues. Worse, it inflates the reputation of hyper-partisan gay-advocacy organizations that often do more harm than good.

What exactly would be debated? It's hard to imagine any potential Democratic challenger offering a dissenting viewpoint on issues like gay marriage or transgender inclusion in the military. If anything, this ""debate"" will likely devolve into a revolving cycle of virtue-signaling agreement, with each candidate competing to sound more sympathetic to the gay plight than the others. That's not productive -- it's performative.

Indulging such identitarian excesses would come at a cost. After all, there is a finite number of debates to be had during a limited campaign season. So any debate dedicated exclusively to LGBT issues is a debate not dedicated to the opioid crisis, poverty, the national debt, or any of the other countless maladies plaguing our society. In a time when gay-marriage rights are settled law, assigning entire news cycles and presidential forums to ""debate"" the less significant LGBT issues still in contention seems, well, nonsensical.

Wouldn't it be more important for Democrats to debate how they're going to pay for the $93 trillion in ""Green New Deal"" proposals that many of the candidates have signed on to? Or perhaps they should discuss the merits of the barbaric and wildly unpopular practice of late-term abortion, which several Democratic challengers have recently refused to condemn? The Democratic base is actually somewhat divided on these issues, and could benefit from a debate that would clarify where each candidate stands.

Alas, such issues are certainly not what the party wants to draw attention to. Supporting this distraction disguised as an LGBT debate rewards that very misalignment of priorities that stresses identity politics over actual issues.

In reality, American issues are gay issues, because the biggest problems facing most gay people are the same problems facing most Americans. There's something fundamentally paternalistic about the notion that gay people need their own special debate, as if the issues everyone else cares about aren't at the forefront of our lives as well. This isn't a precedent we want to set. Before long, we'll have separate Democratic debates for every identity group under the sun -- race, and gender, and so on. Will we eventually forgo talking about national issues altogether?

The (self-proclaimed) gay-rights organization Human Rights Campaign (HRC) will co-sponsor this debate, so the forum will also have the consequence of further legitimizing an objectionable group. HRC claims to be a neutral advocate for gay rights and human rights -- a noble goal -- even describing itself as ""the largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans.""

But in reality, the Human Rights Campaign is a hyper-partisan propaganda outfit that deserves to be disregarded, not rewarded with prime-time coverage. The group certainly advocates for some laudable causes, such as an end to the anti-gay abuses in Chechnya, Russia, that have seen the death and detainment of dozens. Yet the HRC is essentially an arm of the left-wing movement, outrageously smearing congressional Republicans as anti-gay for their stances on completely unrelated issues such as Obamacare, immigration, and Planned Parenthood funding. They're so skewed that when the Trump administration unveiled its diplomatic initiative to fight the criminalization of homosexuality globally, the gay-rights group didn't celebrate the rare moment of bipartisan agreement on human rights -- they put out a Twitter thread slamming the president.

Does that sound like an organization that will fairly host an unbiased debate?

It doesn't seem like that was ever really the intention, anyway. The entire idea of an LGBT-exclusive presidential forum is essentially a PR stunt, meant to signal the party's supposed pro-gay bona fides without actually having to engage in meaningful debate. If Democrats were actually interested in meaningful conversation on LGBT issues, they'd reach across the aisle to conservative groups -- or perhaps even right-leaning gay people -- to sponsor a debate about the right way forward for a pluralistic society.

"Kristin Tate, The Hill contributor and author of 'How Do I Tax Three,' and Democratic strategist Mark Levine, join the debate.

Joe Biden's top political advisers reportedly are debating whether the former vice president should launch a White House bid by pledging to choose a running mate.

BIDEN, SANDERS, REMAIN ON TOP IN LATEST 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY POLL

And that running mate, according to a report from Axios, could be Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia. The former minority leader in the state's House of Representatives nearly became the nation's first black female governor and the first Democrat to win a gubernatorial election in Georgia in two decades, but lost the election.

The new speculation comes after Biden and Abrams had a private sit-down earlier this month, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Abrams has been weighing her own political future, which could include a 2020 Senate bid, a 2022 run for governor again, or even possibly her own White House bid. Abrams is considered a quickly rising star in the party and earlier this year gave the Democratic response to Republican President Trump's State of the Union address.

Abrams would bring diversity to the ticket, and some of Biden's advisers - according to Axios - feel the move would add excitement to the former vice president's campaign. And they feel that pointing to the 45-year old Abrams as a running mate could blunt concerns over the 76-year old Biden's age.

BIDEN HINTS AGAIN AT 2020 WHITE HOUSE RUN

Sources close to Biden have told Fox News that the former vice president is likely next month to announce his campaign, which would be his third stab at trying to win the presidency. And the past two weeks, Biden's publicly strongly hinted that he would be running.

While the former vice president has reportedly discussed naming a running mate early, it's not known if he's signed off on the suggestion of coming out of the gate with a pledge to name a number two on his ticket.

""It would certainly be something unique, something different. It would send a strong message,"" said Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor.

But there are downsides as well. The strategy could be seen as a gimmick that the former vice president needs to stand out in a large Democratic 2020 field, and Biden could be seen as having ""an air of inevitability."" And it could raise the question of whether Biden feels out of step with the current political climate, concerned about decades-old political positions the longtime senator from Delaware held that now are unpopular among Democrats.

""I don't think it's necessary. I don't think he should feel it's something he has to do . At the end of the day he'll go out there and make his own case,"" explained Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

""He may choose to name a running mate before the end of the primary season but I don't he needs to feel compelled to do it on day one.

""I'm disappointed in his administration,"" he stated. ""I would say to him, 'Don, why are you such a putz?'""

While Letterman was happy to discuss politics, his fellow former veteran late-night host, Jay Leno, recently complained about late-night hosts being overly political on the air.

Leno said on the ""Today Show"" last week that there's a perceived lack of ""civility"" from late-night hosts such as Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel amid the genre's heavily political climate.

""You know, everything now... everyone has to know your politics,"" Leno said. ""I tried to use Johnny's model, and I would get hate mail from both sides equally and thought 'well that's fabulous, that's exactly what I want'.""

""But when people see you as one-sided, it makes it tough. And, you know, I did it when Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb, and it was just a little easier.""

"ISLAS MARIAS, Mexico - It's unclear if Islas Marias ever really worked as a penal colony: The remote Mexican archipelago is battered regularly by hurricanes, and its ramshackle, often century-old installations are sprinkled with the ruins of failed ""productive"" projects that once aimed to make the prison population self-sustaining.

Now, with the prison just closed, the hurdles of distance, weather and decayed infrastructure may not make it easy for the islands to prosper in their new role as a nature center and education camp for children.

It's a rough, eight-hour boat ride out to the islands, which lie 70 miles (110 kilometers) off the Pacific shores of Mexico's Nayarit state. Appropriately for a place where most of the few dozen prisoners who attempted to escape drowned, the Environment Department says it is thinking about offering survival courses. Bird watching, nature walks and arts programs are also planned.

All that remains for now are a few goats, some cattle and once-domesticated cats that roam the main island where thousands of prisoners once lived.

The thick-walled remains of an old salt-evaporation warehouse and the disused pools of a former shrimp farm are a mute testament to the idea that Islas Marias was founded on in 1905 -- that penal colonies could earn their keep, and reform inmates through clean living, ocean air and hard work.

Bars and cells weren't necessary because the surrounding ocean effectively prevented escape. Islas Marias was the last of its kind, the final of a half dozen island penal colonies that were scattered around Latin America. It was done in by high costs -- almost $150 per day per inmate, far beyond what mainland prison costs -- and by the increasing space available at mainland prisons as legal reforms reduced jail populations.

Rogelio Zedillo, a former employee in the island's legal area, is one of the believers in the penal colony. Some of his fellow prison employees even want to stay on and are trying to swing transfers to the Environment Department, which will now oversee the islands.

""I think it's a pity that they have closed what could have been a model prison,"" Zedillo said. ""They were self-supporting, they (inmates) were producing. They grew vegetables. They had cattle, goats, pigs. There was a fish farm and a salt works ... the problem was political, the authorities decided not to continue as a penal colony, and so little by little it fell apart.""

Prison official Marco Antonio Rugerio Estrada spent the past 31 years on the main island, known as Maria Madre. He also is sad to see the prison go.

""It was a very healthy life,"" Rugerio Estrada said. ""We started off every day in a very beautiful environment, and that allows you to see life in a different way. You wake up and say, 'I am in a very pretty place,' and you start to recognize yourself.""

But it was far from a tropical paradise for the inmates. They weren't allowed to go the island's beaches. They led a fairly regimented life, with designated areas, bunk beds in small houses and 5 a.m. morning wake-up calls.

Officials say inmates also brewed homemade liquor out of fermented fruit and some tried to grow marijuana. The moonshine, known on the island as ""turbo,"" led to a ban on the possession of sugar by inmates, since it accelerated the fermentation process.

The prison was started as a way to isolate and punish political prisoners, such as striking workers and socialists, and the inmates helped pay its way by working on the salt flats or at the shrimp farm. But in its waning years, salt could be harvested from evaporation ponds on the mainland more cheaply, and transportation costs for the island's shrimp production made it less profitable.

A further blow was the decision in 2006 during Mexico's drug war to turn the colony into a regular prison holding as many as 8,000 to 10,000 inmates. The ""semi-freedom"" the island once offered inmates, and the production schemes, suffered under the influx. The overcrowded, under-fed inmates rioted in 2013, killing six people before marines regained control of the island.

A final blow came this past October, when Hurricane Willa made a direct hit as a Category 3 storm and caused about $100 million in damages to the prison. Buildings can be seen around the island with their roofs torn off.

When it closed in February, the penal colony housed just 659 prisoners.

One of the most charming of the prison's features -- that families, including children, could come live with some inmates -- also proved one of its most costly burdens. And people worried whether the kids were getting a decent childhood on the island and questioned the cost of providing schooling and recreational facilities.

""There are a lot of people in the non-prison population who deserve that funding, to live a decent life,"" said Francisco Garduno Yanez, director of Mexican prisons who was assigned with the task of shutting down the penal colony.",171,Fox News,Mexico's last penal colony starts new life as nature center

"Thierry Baudet's Forum for Democracy party, which has gained attention for its Euroscepticism, campaigned against open borders politics and against what he calls ""climate-change hysteria,"" winning 86 seats across the Dutch regions. The victory put his party ahead of even the ruling mainstream conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), which achieved 80 seats.

Forum was founded in 2016, and this is the first regional election the party has contested. Remarkably, in some Dutch regions Forum was so unexpectedly successful it won the right to appoint more elected members than they actually have registered candidates living in those areas.

The regional seats translate through the Dutch constitutional system into seats in the appointed upper house Senate. The party will have 13 seats, making them the largest group -- and robbing the governing VVD of their majority.

Speaking to Dutch media, leader Thierry Baudet said he was willing to support the establishment parties in government but would demand a ""change of course"" in certain policy areas, specifically mass migration and government spending on climate change policies. Showing the party's newfound power, Baudet even demanded the resignation of several key cabinet ministers, including those responsible for home affairs and immigration, in return for support.

Unlike other countries where establishment parties have totally ruled out working with populist insurgents, even when they hold seats key to establishing a working government, the Netherlands' centrist-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday he would be willing to consider working with Forum to keep the government in power.

Wednesday's election came just two days after what is now understood to have been a terror attack in the Dutch city of Utrecht, which some media commentators both inside the Netherlands and without have said may have influenced the way people chose to vote.

Baudet himself was criticised after the attack for continuing his election campaigning, while others called off rallies. Speaking on the campaign trail, Baudet attacked the governing parties for their role in contributing to the circumstances surrounding the attack, including ""naive and lax"" policies on open borders and criminal justice.

Arguing that despite decades of warnings about the impact of mass migration, ""nothing has changed on this road we are following, with hundreds of thousands of people still coming here"", Baudet warned Dutch voters: ""If we don't choose a different course on Wednesday, [events like this week's shooting] will happen much more often.""

Criticising the Prime Minister, he said: ""We are being destroyed by the people who are supposed to be protecting us... Successive Rutte governments have left our borders wide open, letting in hundreds of thousands of people with cultures completely different to ours.""

Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reports several news sources have likened the ""television genius"" Baudet to U.S. President Donald Trump, who connected directly with voters through social media, bypassing the legacy mainstream media.

The unexpected degree of success for Forum reflects and reinforces a broader trend across Europe which sees populist parties giving an authentic voice to concerns held by voters at the expense of traditional, established parties. This trend is broadly anticipated to continue in the European Union's parliament elections, with as many as one in four voters across the continent expected to vote populist.

Breitbart London reported that among those parties hoping to pick up votes in the European Parliament elections is the Sweden Democrats, which is set to double their representation and the Italian League -- led by populist interior minister Matteo Salvini -- which may become the second largest party in Europe.",173,Breitbart,Populists Go From Zero Seats to Largest Party in Dutch Election
"Reagan and Thatcher: The Difficult Relationship, by Richard Aldous (Norton, 352 pp., $27.95)

Richard Aldous of Bard College has a new book sure to be of interest to readers of National Review. A history of the personal diplomacy between Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, Reagan and Thatcher: The Difficult Relationship argues against the idea of constant affection between these ideological brethren. Indeed, the two statesmen disagreed beginning in Reagan's first year as president, and clashed regularly until his final year in office. What's striking to a reader of this elegantly written history is the relevance of their debates.

President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher argued about national sovereignty. When the Argentine junta invaded the Falkland Islands in the spring of 1982, the Reagan administration did not want Thatcher's government to retaliate militarily. The Argentines were a useful ally in America's fight against Latin American Communism. Reaganites such as U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick did not want to lose an anti-Communist partner over a few islands in the South Atlantic. Thatcher, however, saw Argentina's aggression for what it was: a direct challenge to British sovereignty that could not be appeased. Britain recaptured the islands. Thatcher's popularity spiked.

A year later, when a Communist putsch overthrew the government of Grenada, sovereignty was the issue once more. The Reagan administration prepared an invasion and regime change to stop Cuba and the USSR from establishing a beachhead on the small Caribbean island. Thatcher was incensed, not least because Grenada is a realm of the British Commonwealth whose sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II. Reagan went ahead anyway -- solidifying his own political position and leading Thatcher to question just how much she could count on the United States.

The two leaders had different conceptions of deterrence. When Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the spring of 1983, Thatcher, who held a degree in chemistry from Oxford, was skeptical. She demanded technical briefings in the science of ballistic-missile defense. She also worried that SDI would overthrow the principle of mutual assured destruction, which had deterred the Soviet Union from using its conventional forces to cross Fulda Gap into Western Europe.

Of course, ending the possibility of nuclear war was precisely why Reagan embraced SDI and the goal of nuclear zero. Later, when Reagan was tempted by Mikhail Gorbachev's offer at Reykjavik to stop the arms race, Thatcher was horrified. It would have handed the Soviets the advantage. In an irony of history, Reagan's refusal to give up SDI led him to depart Iceland without an agreement. A policy Thatcher disliked saved the world from another policy she disliked even more.

Reagan and Thatcher had different responses to terrorism. In early 1986 the Reagan administration sanctioned Libya in response to a terrorist attack against U.S. military personnel in Germany the previous Christmas. Thatcher was worried the sanctions were merely the prelude to military intervention. She opposed such action on the grounds that it violated international law and the Westphalian principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of nation-states. ""Once you start to go across borders, then I do not see an end to it and I uphold international law very firmly,"" she told the press at the time.

Secretary of State George Shultz responded in a speech delivered at the National Defense University: ""There is substantial legal authority for the view that a state which supports terrorist or subversive attacks against another state, or which supports or encourages terrorist planning and other activities within its territory, is responsible for such attacks."" No one had any question that Schultz was speaking to Thatcher.

The prime minister was confronted with a decision the following month. Libyan terrorists had killed three Americans in a Berlin nightclub bombing. Would the U.K. assist the now inevitable U.S. response? After much back and forth, Thatcher reluctantly agreed to takeoff and over-flight rights for the U.S. bombers that struck Tripoli on April 14, 1986. The French, in a revealing contrast, denied America permission to use their airspace. British public opinion rebuked Thatcher -- temporarily -- for her stand with the Americans. Reagan rewarded her by pushing successfully for an updated U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty.

""In the end,"" writes Aldous, ""the prime minister calculated that the potential damage to Anglo-American relations of withholding support for the attack on Libya was too great to risk. But it was no coincidence that immediately after the raid she used the Tokyo G7 summit in May to win acceptance of a 'firm' British draft on terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism that brought the issue back into the fold of international cooperation rather than unilateral action.""

Sovereignty, deterrence, terrorism -- the contemporary world is no stranger to these concepts. Yet they have assumed a different character in the generation since Reagan and Thatcher departed elected office. Sovereignty is thought to be outdated, deterrence made obsolete by the irrational behavior of rogue states, terrorism a scourge to be combated wherever it emerges.

Reading this book, I felt myself torn between Reagan's strategic vision and Thatcher's bracing intellect. Her logic was airtight; his grasp of the big picture was profound. I couldn't help wondering what each of them would make of the world they did so much to build. Then again, their actions changed historical conditions so profoundly that such a question is almost pointless. Maybe the best we can say is that the nature and framework of their arguments should inform our own. As we too pursue tirelessly the cause of human freedom.",174,nationalreview.com,Reagan and Thatcher Then  --  and Now | National Review
"New York University's journalism school hired Talia Lavin this week, a former New Yorker factor checker who once falsely claimed that a disabled vet ICE agent had a Nazi tattoo.

According to The Wrap, NYU's journalism school has hired former New Yorker fact checker Talia Lavin to a position on its faculty. Lavin is scheduled to teach a course entitled ""Reporting on the Far Right"" to undergraduate students at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute during the upcoming fall semester.

In June 2018, Lavin faced criticism for a tweet in which she accused disabled veteran and ICE agent Justin Gaertner of having a Nazi tattoo. In reality, the tattoo was a symbol for Gaertner's platoon in Afghanistan. ICE demanded that Lavin apologize to Gaertner for the mistake.

""Over the weekend, social media perpetuated by a Tweet by New Yorker reporter Talia Levin erroneously implied that a tattoo on one of the arms [of ICE agent Justin Gaertner] was an Iron Cross and essentially labeled him a Nazi,"" ICE said in a statement at the time. ""Per Gaertner, the tattoo ... is actually 'Titan 2,' the symbol for his platoon while he fought in Afghanistan,"" the statement said, adding, ""The writing on his right arm is the Spartan Creed which is about protecting family and children.""

Lavin apologized for her mistake and deleted the original tweet. ""Some vets said this ICE agent's tattoo looked more like a Maltese cross than an Iron Cross (common among white supremacists), so i deleted my tweet so as not to spread misinformation,"" Lavin wrote.

The New Yorker also issued a statement at the time, writing that Lavin's personal Twitter account did not represent the magazine.

""The personal social-media accounts of staff members do not represent the magazine, and we in no way share the viewpoint expressed in this tweet,"" a magazine spokesperson told National Review in a statement last June. ""The tweet has been deleted, and we deeply regret any harm that this may have caused Mr. Gaertner.""

One liberal student at New York University said that he doesn't understand the decision to hire Lavin. ""I sympathize with Lavin's politics, but I don't know why someone who had to quit their journalism job for falsely implying someone is a Nazi should be teaching at NYU,"" the student said in an anonymous comment to The Wrap. ""I know there are plenty of reporters out there in need of work who haven't made a mistake like that.""

"MILAN - At the heart of Chinese Premier Xi Jingping's visit to Rome beginning Thursday is a key prize: A deal to make Italy the first major democracy to join China's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure project that has raised concerns about Beijing's growing economic clout.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has pledged to sign the memorandum of understanding on Saturday, despite objections from U.S. allies and doubts within the coalition government that it could give China greater political influence in Europe and the West.

But Xi's visit, at the invitation of Italian President Sergio Mattarella, also aims more broadly at deepening trade and cultural ties. Conte has even suggested that Italy could play a role in easing tensions over trade between China and the United States.

Mattarella told the Chinese stat-run news agency Xinhua Thursday that the visit is an expression of the ""solidity of the bond and mutual respect"" between the two countries, which will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2020.

Xi's visit includes a meeting with Mattarella and a wreath-laying at Italy's monument for unknown soldiers on Friday. On Saturday, Conte will sign the infrastructure deal and Xi will visit the Sicilian city of Palermo before departing Sunday.

Italy's signature on the ambitious ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure-building project would give legitimacy to a project that envisions overland and maritime routes connecting China with Europe, reviving the old Silk Road traveled by Marco Polo in the Middle Ages. The initiative encompasses about 60 countries through Asia and Africa to Europe.

Conte has dismissed concerns that signing the framework with China would downgrade Italy's strategic ties with Europe and the United States, saying its focus was more commercial and on encouraging trade with China.

The White House has criticized the deal, saying it is weighted in China's interests. Italy's European allies have declined to sign a joint declaration on the ""Belt and Road,"" saying it lacks standards on financing and transparency.

While full details have not been released, it includes collaboration and investments in the northern Italian ports of Genoa and Trieste as well as roads, railways, airports and telecommunications.

""Our two countries may harness our historical and cultural bonds forged through the ancient Silk Road,"" Xi wrote in the Corriere della Sera newspaper this week.

Key Italian officials have insisted that the issue of expanding Chinese company Huawei's 5G network into Italy is not part of the ""Belt and Road"" memorandum.

The Chinese 5-G network is viewed with suspicion, mainly by the U.S. government, which says it could give Chinese security services a backdoor to snoop on consumers. The issue is a major source of tension between China and the U.S.

While European countries have balked at banning Huawei outright from participating in the creation of the new 5G networks, one key member of Italy's government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, shares the concerns, saying nothing in the memorandum can threaten Italians' data.

Ahead of the visit, Xi noted that China and Italy are the countries with the largest number of UNESCO world heritage sites, sharing both cultural and tourism resources. He suggested that the two countries could form ""twinning relationships"" between world heritage sites and cooperate on art exhibitions, TV and movie production, language course and travel.

Mattarella said that the heritage of Italy and China both ""arouse admiration around the world"" and could help develop the economy.

The two countries are expected to soon announce the pairing of the Langhe, Roero and Monferrato wine region in Piedmont with China's Honghe Hani rice terraces, while Verona and Hangzhou are to establish sister-city relationships.

Culture and tourism officials will be meeting Saturday on the sidelines of Xi's visit.

Conte said he aims to rebalance trade with China. Currently 1 billion Chinese consumers provide a market for 13 billion euros (nearly $15 billion) in Italian goods, while Italy's 60 million people buy 60 billion euros in Chinese-made products each year.

Italy's undersecretary for economic development, Michele Geraci, says Italy lags its European partners in trade with China by 15 or 20 years, and that the aim is to increase Italian exports to China by 7 billion euros, putting Italy in line with France.

Mattarella said that Italy sees China ""not only as an economic partner of prime importance, but also as a driver of global trade,"" and a market for Italian technology and expertise in areas like environmental protection, food security, health services and machinery. He called for ""open and transparent"" trade with both countries acting ""on an equal basis.""

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao said the ""Belt and Road"" deal would be beneficial for both countries' economic development and trade.

However, Francois Godement, a specialist in Chinese politics at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, called such claims ""bogus,"" because Chinese companies already have significant investments in Italy.

"Progressive pundits think he's unwoke; primary voters might not care

Believe it or not, there are still a few Democrats left in the United States Senate who are not running for president. And among those sitting on the sidelines, they see a lot to like in a politician who hasn't joined the field: Joe Biden.

""If he were in the race, he would I think have a lot of support, and he's someone I'd think very seriously about supporting,"" Pennsylvania Democratic senator Bob Casey tells National Review. ""I don't know a vice president who was more effective, who had greater responsibility.""

Wisconsin Democratic senator Tammy Baldwin, who won reelection by eleven points in her crucial swing state last November, also has praise for him: ""The last few times [Biden has] been in Wisconsin, just focusing on respecting the dignity of hard work and economic opportunity, he's really knocked it out of the park.""

""As have many other Democratic candidates,"" she quickly adds.

""Joe Biden's been a wonderful public servant,"" says Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate.

But for every elected Democratic official who likes Biden, you can find scores of pundits who will tell you that he is overrated as a potential primary candidate. ""If he declares for the presidency, Biden will face a Democratic electorate that has moved on from his brand of politics,"" according to one Huffington Post writer.

Is Biden too old, too corporatist, too conservative for today's Democratic party? Trying predict the future is a fool's errand, but it's safe to say that he has had a very good 2019 so far, and that his path to the nomination remains very realistic.

During the first week of March, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg announced he wouldn't seek the Democratic nomination. His absence would help Biden consolidate self-described moderate Democrats. Around the same time, Ohio senator Sherrod Brown announced he wouldn't run, and that could help Biden add more union members to his coalition. Brown's absence would also bolster the claim that Biden has the best shot of winning back Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, the three Rust Belt states that narrowly decided the 2016 election. Brown publicly warned MSNBC viewers during a March 13 appearance that 2020 hopefuls who are lurching leftward aren't thinking about the general election.

The candidate Biden would be running against in the ""moderate"" lane is Amy Klobuchar, who launched her campaign on February 10. The Minnesota senator is thought by some to have underappreciated strength in the neighboring state of Iowa, but she was sitting at 3 percent in an Iowa poll conducted March 3-6 for the Des Moines Register and CNN. The good news for Klobuchar is that people are still talking about her: She was the subject of the best article published so far about the 2020 Democratic primary. The bad news? That article, by Caitlin Flanagan in The Atlantic, was a devastating piece on the senator's alleged abusive behavior toward her staff, which ranged from berating her employees to throwing objects at them.

And what about the crowded ""progressive"" lane? All of those candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, but they have fought over whether private health insurance should be abolished and whether existing border fencing should be torn down. Kamala Harris, who could be the most formidable opponent in a head-to-head race against Biden, had a particularly bad stumble on ""Medicare for all."" Elizabeth Warren is still trying to recover from her DNA test. The leading candidate in this group is socialist Bernie Sanders, who has drawn impressive crowds and put up impressive fundraising numbers -- and would be Biden's ideal foil in 2020.

The Des Moines Register poll mentioned above found Biden leading Sanders 27 percent to 25 percent in Iowa, with all other candidates in the single digits. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight observes that the Iowa poll, when adjusted for name recognition, ""doesn't really change much at all."" It's early, but CNN's Harry Enten points out that the ""leader in the Iowa caucuses polls at this point have won the nomination 7 of 14 times.""

Perhaps the best sign for Biden's prospects could be seen in a March 15 article by Politico's Gabby Orr, who reported that ""behind closed doors, [President Trump] has fixated on Biden, while top aides have tried to assure their boss that the former vice president is doomed"" in an increasingly left-wing party. As he proved in 2016, Trump has a better intuitive grasp of electoral politics than most political aides and pundits.

Talk of Biden's being out of step with today's Democratic party on this or that issue ignores what Democratic voters are actually saying. The Iowa poll found that 70 percent of likely caucus-goers say Joe Biden's political views are ""about right,"" while 14 percent say Biden is ""too conservative."" Only 48 percent say Bernie Sanders's views are ""about right,"" while 44 percent say Sanders is ""too liberal."" The same poll found that 49 percent of voters fully back ""Medicare for all,"" while 35 percent only support taking steps toward it -- the kind of half measure Biden will likely favor -- and 11 percent oppose it outright.

There are a lot of Democratic voters who don't see some impassable divide between Biden and Sanders. ""The Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders duopoly was interesting to me in that their supporters' second choice was each other, primarily,"" J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who conducted the Iowa survey, tells National Review. Biden's campaign to move America's health-care system to the left of Obamacare and more than double the federal minimum wage -- from $7.25 to $15 -- would have been seen as quite liberal the day before yesterday.

Those who argue that Biden is too out of touch with today's Democratic party also fail to take into account that the Democratic nominee doesn't really need a majority of the party to win the nomination -- not at the beginning, at least. He or she likely needs to win two out of the first three marquee contests -- Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. In a large field, winning those early states might require only one-third of the electorate, as Trump proved in 2016. With two early wins, voters would very likely fall in line, just as they did for Trump and Clinton in 2016, Obama and McCain in 2008, Kerry in 2004, Bush in 2000, and Dole in 1996.

Mitt Romney is the only candidate in nearly three decades who (kind of) broke this rule: He was declared the winner of Iowa on Caucus Night (and the headlines are what counts when it comes to building momentum) but later fell behind Santorum by 34 votes in the final tally; several precincts were never counted. The last major-party nominee who didn't win either Iowa or New Hampshire was Bill Clinton in 1992, when Iowa senator Tom Harkin took his home state off the map and Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won New Hampshire.

Can Biden win two of the three early states? He's a couple of points ahead of Sanders in early Iowa polling and a few points behind Sanders in New Hampshire polling. In South Carolina, Biden led Sanders by 16 points in a recent Emerson poll -- 37 percent to 21 percent -- with all other candidates in single digits. In 2016, shortly after Sanders scored a 22-point win over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, the Vermont socialist was crushed by Clinton in South Carolina by 47 points. The 77-year-old Sanders takes the age issue off the table for 76-year-old Biden, but Sanders's weakness among African-American voters is the real reason he would be Biden's ideal foil.

Some have suggested that Biden's record on busing in the 1970s would badly damage him among African-American voters. But there is perhaps no better example of the disconnect between some progressive pundits and actual Democratic voters than the discussion of this issue.

New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote in a March column that Biden's rhetoric in the 1970s about busing ""was on the same wavelength"" as the vicious segregationist George Wallace's had been. ""The real problem with busing,"" Biden said at the time, was that ""you take people who aren't racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children's intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school . . . and you're going to fill them with hatred.""

The same day as that column appeared, McClatchy reporter Katie Glueck published an article titled: ""In a shifting party, Biden maintains strength with SC's black Democrats."" The piece was filled with comments from African-American voters optimistic about a Biden candidacy, along with pastors and politicians testifying to his strength as a candidate. ""If Biden gets in the race, everybody else would be running for second place,"" South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, told Jonathan Martin and Astead Herndon of the New York Times in January.

Can any candidate attack Biden's position on busing in the 1970s without taking the position today that some children currently attending safe and successful suburban schools should be bused to dangerous and failing urban schools? It's hard to believe that any Democratic candidate who could win the presidency in 2020 will run on that platform. It would be good, of course, if Democratic candidates supported policies to allow children attending dangerous and failing schools to attend safe and successful schools. But then those candidates would be conservative Republicans who back school-choice programs, not liberal Democrats beholden to teachers' unions.

Is it easy to see a different Democratic candidate, such as Kamala Harris, carrying Iowa and South Carolina and capturing the nomination? Of course. Bernie Sanders is an equally serious candidate, and no one should count out the rest of the field, either.

Navigating an energized progressive base will be no simple task for Biden. For example, Biden is a longtime supporter of the Hyde amendment, a ban on federal funding of elective abortions, unlike recent Democratic presidential nominees. Tim Kaine was tripped up in 2016 trying to reconcile his support for the ban with Hillary Clinton's opposition, but today he says: ""I don't think it's a litmus [test]. I think it's a very important issue to people of all different stripes. . . . That one is going to be hashed out, along with so many others, during the primary process and then during the general.""

Will Biden flip-flop on the issue? Or will he continue to oppose the progressive Democratic base? Both options, on this matter and others, carry political risks. Biden will face plenty of obstacles once he enters the race, but none appear so large right now that he could not make it to the general election.

"Not too long ago, a young friend of mine was trying to remember the name of a movie. ""You know that movie where the two women drive off a cliff at the end? What was that movie called? Was it Laverne & Shirley?""

And he wasn't even trying to be cruel. In his mind, all of those things just collided together, and why shouldn't they? When you're young, everything that happened before you were born is history, and everything that happened afterwards is life. It's only natural, if you're young, to care more about life. Laverne, Shirley, Thelma, Louise -- what's the difference, really, if you were born in 1987? One is a TV show that went off the air in 1983; the other is a movie that premiered a mere eight years later.

But when you're old -- and I'm not pointing fingers here, but you know who you are -- history and life become so muddled up that the only way to keep the memories straight is to know where you were when certain things happened. The way an old person keeps Reykjavik and hanging chads and ketchup-as-a-vegetable and Janet Reno and fidget spinners all in the right blips on the time line is to think about what was going on in your life at the time: senior year in college, remodeling a house, ninth grade, making real money for the first time, and right before I had my first colonoscopy.

In politics, it often comes down to an emotional memory. Did I care whether George H. W. Bush prevailed against Michael Dukakis in 1988? I really, honestly, and truly did. Did I care, eight years later, whether Bob Dole unseated Bill Clinton? I really, honestly, and truly did not. The difference wasn't the country or the world or the challenges of the end of the American Century. The difference was me: In 1988 I was 23 and thought that life was full of critical turning points, and in 1996 I was 31 and thought, You know, things just tend to work themselves out. Also, as I have mentioned, in 1996 I was making real money for the first time.

The Obama years are, for me, a mishmash of iPhones. I remember sending emails on my very first iPhone to a politically wise friend of mine, asking when he thought Obama would drop out and concede the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton. I can still conjure up the mental picture of his reply -- ""He won't. He's going to win"" -- and the derisive snort I made when I read it. (I made similar snorts eight years later, by the way.)

I'm pretty sure it was on the 2008 iPhone 3G that I saw a video, produced by some neighbors of mine in Venice Beach, of a dozen or so young kids in identical powder-blue T-shirts with ""Hope"" emblazoned in what we now call ""Obama sans"" or ""Obama Neue"" font, singing a song composed by their beaming parents -- visible, like all good progressive parents, just at the edge of the screen, making encouraging gestures and gazing with admiration at their children. ""Obama's going to change it, Obama's going to lead them,"" a picture-perfect little girl sings -- she's even, adorably, missing her front teeth. The kids sing and chant and make stylized jazz hands, and yes, they're singing about Obama, so yes, it's all a little much, but it's hard to watch a bunch of sweetly cheerful children around ten or eleven and keep a scowl on your face. I managed, obviously, but not without some real effort.

The parents, of course, are awful. Dressed in Venice Beach Bohemian, hairdos all kooky and quirky, one of them plays the flute, interesting hat wear, adult males with skateboards -- it's all a little bit past parody, though because these are my neighbors I know it's true. I know them because I've seen them at the local coffee shop with toddlers named ""Hosea"" and ""Mabel,"" ""Esteban"" and ""Strawberry."" I've seen them look at their kids the way I sometimes look at my Labrador, with a kind of open-mouthed adoration, with the kind of love you can have for a thing that will joyfully and enthusiastically learn the basic commands, run and chase a tennis ball, climb up next to you on the sofa, and put its head in your lap, pretend to care about what you care about, and sing a stupid song you wrote about Obama.

The video is still up there, on YouTube, and depending on your point of view it's either a nutty artifact of a profoundly silly cult or a grim herald of things to come. My vote is the latter, because ever since I watched that video on my iPhone 3G I've been watching similar videos on thinner and faster phones: videos of children at town halls, prodded by their parents (iPhone 4); videos of children protesting this or that complicated issue with doe eyes and hand-painted T-shirts (iPhone 5); and, most recently, a staged confrontation between children upset about climate change and the senior senator from California, Dianne Feinstein, who finally snapped (she's almost 90, after all) and told the kids to shut it. And, boy, did that cause a freak-out, because you're not supposed to yell at someone else's kids, just like you're not supposed to reprimand someone else's dog.

Last month -- and I know it was last month because I saw it on my new iPad Pro with Retina display -- I watched an eleven-year-old boy perform a drag act at a gay bar in Brooklyn, collecting dollar bills from adult male patrons and getting a lot of positive media attention. His parents aren't evident in the video I watched, but news accounts portray them as terrifically supportive. They'd have to be, I guess, because someone has to pay for those outfits and all that makeup. The kid is good but, to judge from the video, not much of an earner. Yet, anyway.

The parents are brainwashing those kids! is what we hear, on Fox News and on Twitter timelines. And that's probably true, although the thing about brainwashing is that it doesn't really last.

They're using their kids as props! is another claim, and that's definitely true. There's something off-putting about parents who are so eager to put their obedient and politically aligned children front and center, uploaded to YouTube or annoying a senator or twerking for dollars in drag. It's weird and creepy in the same way that the old Toys-R-Us logo was creepy. It had the ""R"" printed backwards, as if drawn by a child. (Or a Russian, but that's not what they were going for.)

We knew it wasn't drawn by a child. We knew it was drawn by an art director who was trying to draw like a child, which made the whole thing seem forced and untrue, like a bunch of kids pretending to love a presidential candidate or an eleven-year-old lip-syncing to songs he (I hope) doesn't totally understand.

Full disclosure: I am not licensed to practice psychology, though I'm about to do it anyway. We say that parents try to ""live through"" their children. Their hopes and dreams, thwarted ambitions, unrealized goals -- all of these are loaded onto their offspring in a set of impossibly heavy expectations in order to have their children become just like them, only better. Here, though, with these parents, it seems to be reversed. They don't want their kids to be like them; they want to be their kids. They don't want to be grown-ups with all of that irritating experience and perspective. They want to be children, wearing T-shirts and shorts, confronting politicians with youthful zeal and ignorance, not being responsible for doing the reading or appreciating the complexity. Not being adults, in other words. The children of these parents have become what Freudians might call ""self objects"" -- empty vessels to be used to wrap up some unfinished business, to complete some childhood experiences, to have the activist and politically dramatic youth that kids who grew up in the '80s and '90s didn't have.

Look at the faces of the parents in that long-ago Venice Beach video. (For that matter, look at their clothes! Perfect for after-school play dates!) Listen to the voices of the parents of those kids who got an earful from Dianne Feinstein. They sound like petulant children. The actual children involved, on the other hand, sound a lot more tempered and philosophical. Maybe that's why their parents gave them such grown-up, old-timey names. It keeps them in their place. ""Doug"" and ""Jennifer"" sound like kids' names. ""Hosea"" and ""Mabel"" sound like old people.

It was more than ten iPhones ago when my Venice Beach neighbors made their children sing praises to Barack Obama. The angelic children of that video are now twelve years older -- some of them out of college already, on the way to lives of their own. Some of them, I'm pretty sure, work at my local coffee shop, and every now and then I try to look past the neck tattoos and ear gauges and skinny jeans and see if I can recognize one or two. I wonder whether they remember that day and that song. I wonder whether they have a really clear memory of the man they were singing about or it's all a Laverne & Shirley & Thelma & Louise muddle. I wonder, while I watch them gravely pour out some heart-shaped latte art, whether their parents ever backed off and let them have childhoods of their own.

"January is the most popular time to meet singles, according to Tinder. And a new year means a slew of new dating trends to be wary of before jumping back on the market.

""If I see somebody who's like, 'I'm moderate or conservative,' I keep swiping,"" Bronx resident Nadine Anglesey tells The Post. The 33-year-old art director hasn't dated a conservative since the 2016 election -- even if she's attracted to him. ""Yesterday, this one guy [on the dating app Hinge] seemed really great 'til I saw he marked himself as conservative,"" she says. ""I nipped that in the bud.""

Anglesey's not alone: Whether red or blue, most millennials would pick their party over the best lay of their life, according to new research.

WOMAN CRITICIZED FOR SENDING OUT WEDDING RSVPS BEFORE BOYFRIEND HAS EVEN PROPOSED

The number of millennial men and women who prioritize political party alliance over good sex has skyrocketed since 2016, according to data from OkCupid. The matchmaking company surveyed more than 8 million users, and found that interest in dating someone with similar political beliefs has gone up 165 percent since 2004, while having good sex has decreased as a priority 30 percent.

Specifically, between 2016 and 2018, the number of women who consider politics more important than sex shot up from 27 percent to 42 percent, while for men that needle moved from 23 percent to 30 percent.

So what's the link? Manhattan sex therapist Megan Fleming thinks dating strictly within one's party is making people comfortable -- too comfortable.

""If you're only exposing yourself to people who think like you, you're living in a silo and missing out on opportunities,"" says Fleming. She believes that less intellectual tension could translate to less of a lustful spark in a relationship. She encourages her patients to get out of their comfort zone -- in love and in bed.

That was the case for Julie, a 27-year-old Brooklyn liberal and senior public relations manager who dated a Republican for three years. For the political opposites, Julie says, ""Everything was very extreme"" -- including the sex. After particularly frustrating, politically charged conversations, ""We'd have makeup sex"" that was ""better than normal,"" she says.

It wasn't enough to hold them together, and today Julie -- who declined to give her last name for privacy reasons -- finds going out with fellow liberals ""a breath of fresh air."" But she misses the adventure of being with someone very different from herself. ""[We] enjoyed being challenged and challenging each other, and maybe that's something I'm still looking for,"" she says. She's currently single and open to being with a conservative again, depending on ""his beliefs.""

"Friends of our founding document lack politicians to support

America's constitutional order is under siege in the Trump era, according to many observers. As long as the Republicans retain their current win-at-all-costs orientation and remain politically competitive, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman writes, ""we will be one election away from losing democracy in America."" Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright felt moved by President Trump's ascendance to write a book titled ""Fascism: A Warning."" Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt did her one better with the title ""How Democracies Die.""

These worries about our country's constitutional future have mostly had to do with how the president has spoken about our system of government, though in just the past few weeks, Trump's actions have also given constitutionalists something to worry about.

Having failed to get Congress to fund the construction of more sections of a wall at the southern border, the president moved to declare an emergency and repurpose toward wall funding some money that Congress had allocated elsewhere. This declaration has led to a revival of charges that Trump harbors authoritarian tendencies, that he's a would-be tyrant, or that he otherwise threatens the Constitution.

His emergency declaration is in fact highly objectionable and surely does fly in the face of our constitutional order. It was so disconcerting that many conservatives not otherwise inclined to criticize Trump did so in this case, including some in Congress. In the House, 13 Republicans joined the Democrats in voting for a resolution of disapproval that would have rescinded Trump's declaration. Twelve Senate Republicans did the same, enabling the resolution to pass and forcing Trump to veto it. Some other Republicans felt it necessary to issue labored explanations making it clear they were uneasy with the president's power grab even if they could not bring themselves to vote against it.

Liberal observers have been all the more critical, of course. At Slate, William Saletan argued that by siding with Trump, most congressional Republicans failed in their constitutional duty. Trump was acting, he wrote, ""in defiance of the express will of Congress."" By letting him do it, Republicans showed that there is indeed a national emergency. ""But the threat isn't coming from Mexico. It's coming from the Republican Party.""

Saletan has a point. This kind of dereliction, in furtherance of Trump's counter-constitutional emergency declaration, is indeed a threat to our constitutional order. But it is far from the only threat, and Republicans are not the only reason for constitutionalists to be alarmed. The Democrats are at least as much of a danger to our constitutional order. And they're becoming more of a danger with each passing day.

Liberals not only disagree with this assessment; they can't quite fathom it. And therefore they can't quite grasp why more conservatives who share some of their serious concerns about the Trump-led Republican party won't simply defect and support the Democrats -- at least for a time, until the danger passes. They think the reluctance of conservatives to do this must be evidence of a weakness of will, or of blinding partisanship, or of bad faith. But it's this very inability among liberals to grasp the concerns of conservative constitutionalists about today's Democrats that suggests some partisan blindness.

To see the threat that the American Left poses to constitutionalism, we might begin with the very case that liberal critics make against President Trump's emergency declaration. Saletan, for example, does not make a technical legal argument about the National Emergencies Act of 1976. He makes the point that what Trump is doing is an abuse of the core logic of the constitutional system.

But that very case applies in just the same way to some of what President Barack Obama did on immigration enforcement, especially his policies of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (known as ""DACA"") and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (""DAPA""). President Obama asked Congress to take action, Congress declined to act, and the president then acted on his own in frustration. There were some liberal misgivings before Obama acted -- including some expressed by the president himself -- but once he did, everyone on the left fell in line. Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 saying she might go yet further. Even the kind of modest rebuke that Trump received from some members of Congress in his own party was nowhere to be seen in the case of Obama. For a cause they cared about, liberals were perfectly willing to put aside any constitutional scruples.

But the tension between today's Left and the Constitution goes beyond these episodes. In recent years, the Left has more and more openly opposed basic features of the constitutional structure that protect pluralism and block large factions from imposing their will on everyone else. Frank rejections of the Electoral College, of the equal representation of states in the Senate, and of religious liberty are becoming ever more normal among Democrats. Some on the left discovered a previously unarticulated love of the filibuster and states' rights once Trump got elected, but it is perfectly clear that these are purely situational preferences -- a constitutionalism of convenience, and barely even that.

The top priority of congressional Democrats upon retaking control of the House this year, for instance, was H.R. 1, the so-called For the People Act. Among numerous other constitutional problems, including violations of the First Amendment's free-speech protections, that bill would put the administration of elections, voter-qualification decisions, and the drawing of congressional districts into federal hands, in direct contravention of several constitutional provisions.

The weakening of Congress's powers, a main cause of the growing dysfunction of our constitutional system, is evidently very welcome on the left. Liberalism has grown increasingly inclined to favor legislation that hands blank checks of discretionary authority to the executive branch. That was the case with Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation overhaul, neither of which was traditional legislation in the sense of the New Deal or Great Society programs (however they may have offended conservatives on size-of-government grounds). It would surely be the case with the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.

Liberalism has also grown increasingly inclined over the years to regard political accountability for government agencies as a neutering of them. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a creation of Dodd-Frank, is Exhibit A for this point. It is funded by the Federal Reserve, not Congress, but independent from both: an institutional structure that gives the CFPB power at the expense of accountability. The heads of other government agencies have, unsurprisingly, asked for similar arrangements to be made for them, and the progressive logic behind the CFPB -- agencies have to be insulated from political pressure to act as watchdogs -- will surely be applied again.

Progressives are also as committed as ever to a view of judging that collapses the legislative and judicial roles into each other, and they have been friendly to such a view even in the Trump years provided that the judges involved have put obstacles in the way of Republican measures. Conservative judges sometimes err, needless to say, but they are at least committed to something much closer to a sound understanding of the Constitution and the proper role of the courts under it.

The Democratic party's view of judging is now more or less organized around the proposition that the Supreme Court must continue to keep state governments from affording legal protection to unborn children: around, that is, reading into the nation's fundamental law a denial of human equality and democratic rights that isn't there. Progressives also want the Court to supervise the drawing of legislative-district boundaries to prevent conservatives from deriving any benefit from their geographic dispersion. They want the Court to abolish capital punishment regardless of public opinion, legislative decisions, and the text of the Constitution. At the same time, they want the Court to retreat from enforcement of provisions that are actually in the Constitution, such as the right to keep and bear arms.

All of these views, and so this overall relationship to the constitutional system, have gained prominence in progressive politics in recent decades, and there is no reason to think they have changed in the Trump era. This leaves conservative constitutionalists, including those who are worried about some of what the Trump administration is up to, with no real reason to place any hope in Democrats.

In September 2016, just a few weeks before the election, we wrote in these pages that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump posed different kinds of threats to the constitutional order, but that the threat represented by Trump might at least be mitigated by his own mercurial nature. That has been largely borne out.

Trump hasn't done much to expand presidential power or to threaten civil liberties -- but then, and contrary to the views of some of his biggest fans and foes alike, he hasn't done much, period. He has on several occasions acted in ways that reduced the executive branch's authority: rescinding Obama's orders on immigration, halting some Obamacare subsidies that have dubious statutory grounding, and supporting legislation to require congressional approval for major regulations.

When his policies have run close to the constitutional line or crossed it, as with early versions of the travel ban, he has in practice accepted court decisions against him. The emergency declaration for border-wall funding has been the first real practical instance of his violating the essential structure of the constitutional order. In this formal sense, Hillary Clinton would likely have been a far greater menace to the Constitution than Trump has been.

On the other hand, Trump has eroded some norms that buttress constitutional government. A president should ordinarily refrain from commenting on the operations of law enforcement, should encourage respect for the judiciary, and should not come within a thousand miles of flirting with political violence by his supporters. Some of Trump's conduct in this regard has no precedent in the Obama era or before and has been truly egregious.

Trump's inability to perform, or apparent lack of interest in performing, much of the traditional job of the presidency is also a small-c constitutional problem for his underlings, for legislators, and for citizens. (Aides have to decide which of his statements are meant as serious orders, for example.) And he has shown an implacable ignorance of the structure and proper functioning of the constitutional system. The president seems to identify our institutions fully with the people in charge of them and to think in personal rather than institutional terms. With respect to this kind of open subversion of norms, Trump has been worse than Hillary Clinton was likely to be.

But norm subversion begets more norm subversion, and so this vice too has been bipartisan in the Trump era. The refusal of some on the left to accept the legitimacy of a duly elected president and the open encouragement of bureaucratic resistance to his agenda, for instance, also undermine the political culture that the Constitution requires.

In our 2016 article, we concluded that constitutionalism had no champion in the presidential election, so that friends of the Constitution had no obvious candidate to support. That conclusion, too, stands.

Through much that he says and also some of what he does, Donald Trump certainly poses a meaningful threat to our constitutional system. Friends of the Constitution should not ignore this fact or push it to the side. But now, as before Trump's election, the Democrats who oppose him pose a more concerted and comprehensive threat to that system. They do not offer a viable alternative to defenders of constitutionalism. To see Trump (or his party) as a singular disease within an otherwise basically healthy constitutional order would be to misunderstand the challenge.

Recognizing this will not make the work of today's constitutionalists easier. We still have no good options among the politicians and should be careful not to pretend otherwise. But the health of our constitutional system is not revealed by how people answer a yes-or-no question about Donald Trump.

A healthy constitutional system would certainly benefit from a better president. But it would also require an appropriately assertive Congress and judges who understand their proper role. Above all, and in order to make any of this possible, it would benefit from citizens more eager to demand allegiance to the Constitution in return for their votes. To simply wait and hope for any of this would be na√Øve. Bringing it about will require work -- both civic education and political action.

Constitutionalists must in the short term maneuver within a depressing political landscape and choose among very unappealing options while also doing the long-term work of restoring a healthy political culture with the Constitution at its center. That work has to begin with an accurate, even if disheartening, assessment of where we are.

"Victor Davis Hanson's newest book is also one of his most personal. Hanson is a celebrated historian of war, a retired professor of classics, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a National Review columnist. But he is also a farmer in California's Central Valley. He routinely peppers his articles and even his academic work with telling details about farming life and social realities in Selma, a town outside Fresno where he lives in the same house in which he was born and raised. In this book, as in his others, the glimpses of Selma come only in support of Hanson's wider thesis, never as part of an effort to tell his personal story. Nevertheless, beneath the surface of dispassionate analysis, the book burns with emotion.

Its source is easy to identify. In 1980, Hanson writes, Selma ""was a prosperous multiethnic and multiracial community of working- and middle-class families."" From his graduating class of 250, only about ten went off to college; the rest stayed behind, thanks to an abundance of high-paying jobs on farms and in canneries. Within a few short years, those jobs were gone. Canneries and food processors had moved abroad, and farms had been sold off or rented to large corporations. Despite the shrinking job market, Mexican immigrants -- legal and illegal -- flooded in. ""By 2010, high unemployment was chronic, drug addiction was endemic, crime commonplace,"" Hanson writes. ""In 1970, we did not have keys for our outside doors; in 2018, I have six guard dogs.""

Hanson left high school to pursue a bright future, but many people close to him went on to lead lives of quiet desperation. Selma's inhabitants, he continues, ""are not culpable for the vast transformations in the city's economic, social, and cultural landscape. Those changes were mostly a result of the laxity of immigration enforcement and importation of inexpensive labor, globalized trade policy, and the vertical integration of agriculture."" Big government allied with big business to destroy much of what was best about Selma. A large swathe of small-town America suffered a similar fate.

Both political parties played a role in this tragedy. In recent years, however, the Democrats have grown especially contemptuous of those whose lives were mauled by globalism. The Democrats of yesteryear saw themselves as representatives of the laboring classes, but their descendants are dedicated to achieving ""social justice,"" a phrase with a highly specific meaning.

According to contemporary progressivism, power and privilege in society flow from fundamental identities. Social-justice warriors deem people ""marginalized"" or ""privileged"" according to their skin color, religion, or sexual orientation. The uneducated immigrants who flooded Selma are marginalized and therefore deserving of empathy and a helping hand. The longtime residents who lost their livelihood and decry immigration are privileged and therefore targets of contempt. They are the ""bitter"" ones who ""cling"" to guns or religion, as Barack Obama said of the people of central Pennsylvania in 2008; a ""basket of deplorables,"" as Hillary Clinton famously called Trump supporters; or toothless ""garbage people,"" as Politico reporter Marc Caputo described attendees at a Trump rally last year.

Three-quarters of Hanson's book focuses not on Trump himself or on his policies but on the awesome gap that has grown between ""the two Americas"" -- the people in Selma and similar towns and cities ravaged by globalism, and the bicoastal elite. ""Their once prosperous and stable community did not really deserve to erode,"" Hanson writes of his fellow townsmen. ""They were and are certainly not lazy or stupid people, and they had sought all sorts of remedies to redress their plights and save their town."" These people are not in a position to write book-length analyses about why they came to embrace an orange-hued, uncouth Manhattan billionaire as their defender. But Hanson is. The unstated goal of The Case for Trump is to give a voice to these voiceless people.

Hanson has been living on the fault line between cosmopolitan and small-town America for all his adult life. Is there a better analyst of it? Is there, for example, another conservative pundit who is as well versed in the intellectual origins of the social-justice movement? Thanks to the losing academic battles that Hanson waged in the 1990s and early 2000s against multiculturalism and intersectionality, the academic fads that spawned contemporary progressivism, his familiarity with these doctrines is thorough. This intimacy adds nuance to his analyses that is lacking in many other conservative writers.

On an intellectual level, those movements are shoddy and threadbare, but as tools for imposing discipline on organizations -- academic, bureaucratic, or corporate -- they are highly effective. They foster an institutional culture that silences dissent. Merely to question the progressives' ""diversity"" initiatives is to declare oneself a bigot, a person of ""privilege"" seeking to keep minorities down.

At first glance, progressivism might seem ill suited to national electoral politics. After all, affluent whites are an indispensable component of any Democratic coalition. Yet progressivism singles them out for opprobrium. Won't it lose their vote? Hanson explains that the ideology exempts its adherents (and especially its richest adherents) from its strictures. Progressivism, he writes, is ""increasingly pyramidal, perhaps best called 'oligarchical socialism,' with the extremely wealthy advocating for redistribution for the poor."" Those at the top of the pyramid are sheltered from the effects of the destructive policies they visit on others. They share with the ""subsidized poor"" at the bottom a ""disdain for the struggle of most of those in between.""

As California became a one-party state, the most pernicious aspects of academic identity politics migrated off campus to become a hallowed part of the ruling elite's ideology. The same process was at work simultaneously in New York and Massachusetts. After Obama took office in 2009, he gradually signaled to his followers that he intended to rule as a progressive. A new possibility arose. Perhaps the Democrats could replicate the California model on the national level.

It was a heady dream, to be sure, but it proved harder to realize than its architects expected. One problem was the alienated in places like Selma. In the 2008 election, ""Obama posed as a near-centrist Democrat candidate,"" Hanson writes. ""He opposed gay marriage. . . . Raising the issue of transgender restrooms in 2008 would have been absurd."" By the time Obama left office in 2017, the old Reagan Democrats in the Rust Belt understood that he had empowered the hard Left. ""There was now no such thing as a centrist Democrat, much less a conservative working-class one."" Obama had not only handed a weakened coalition to Hillary Clinton, who was a much less talented politician; he had also paved the way for Trumpism.

To those ravaged by globalism, Trump was the only candidate in 2016 who spoke clearly and directly about the issues that most concerned them -- a return of jobs and an end to unlawful immigration. Moreover, he promised to truly fight against progressivism. Many conservative voters had tired of the establishment Republican candidates, who seemed more content to lose honorably than to fight to win. Voters no longer trusted the Republican party to stand for the rights of the little guy against the demands of big business or lecturing from the media. They ""empathized with the bad-apple Trump,"" Hanson explains. They ""believed that whatever he dished out to the media . . . was long overdue.""

To a great many of Trump's detractors, his character disqualifies him from office. But many of these detractors, including some Never Trumpers on the right, are comfortable with progressivism, whereas a good many Trump supporters see it as a cancer. For them, Hanson explains, Trump is ""chemotherapy, which after all is used to combat something far worse than itself."" They also get a vicarious thrill from his brawling, seeing it, Hanson writes, ""as a long overdue pushback to the elite disdain and indeed hatred shown them.""

But there are downsides, Hanson concedes, to Trump's abrasive qualities. For one thing, few of those with whom Trump has exchanged blows seem to share his remarkable ability, after the fight has served its purpose, to let bygones be bygones. They sulk, nurture grudges, and lash out. Senator John McCain's deciding vote that saved Obamacare from repeal is likely a case in point. If Trump had been less brutal in his attacks on a war hero during the 2016 campaign, might he have gained McCain's crucial support for a major campaign promise?

Be that as it may, Hanson credits Trump with remarkable successes, including, to name just a few: the vibrant economy, record employment, two successful Supreme Court appointments, a slew of federal judicial appointments, the recalibration in trade relations with China, the moving of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and the restoring of American deterrence against Russia and China. But these successes will never offer Trump a path to national respectability.

He is fated to remain a difficult outsider -- a tragic hero. ""Trump,"" Hanson writes, ""likely will end in one of two fashions, both not particularly good: either spectacular but unacknowledged accomplishments followed by ostracism when he is out of office and no longer useful, or, less likely, a single term due to the eventual embarrassment of his beneficiaries, as if his utility is no longer worth the wages of his perceived crudity."" This pessimism is in part based on Hanson's reading of Trump's character as more suited to cutting Gordian knots than to organizing coalitions.

But it's also a read on Trump's anomalous position in the standoff between the two Americas. Voters in places like Selma still wield sufficient electoral weight to swing key battleground states. Despite the advantage that their influence offers the GOP, elements in the Republican elite remain ambivalent about them, as well as about Trump and his nationalist agenda. In theory, the Democratic party could capitalize on this ambivalence and entice the victims of globalism to vote for it. Doing so, however, would require displaying a modicum of empathy for them -- a demand that, these days, seems too much to ask. The Democratic-party faithful appear more intent than ever on forcing the country on a march to social justice. They have yet to learn that their open contempt for the working class played a role in their stunning loss in 2016.

And they probably never will. That is one very good reason that Hanson identifies the first of his two predictions -- a successful two-term Trump presidency -- as the more likely one.

"From Fire, by Water: My Journey to the Catholic Faith, by Sohrab Ahmari (Ignatius, 240 pp., $22.95)

Religious faith is difficult to justify to those who don't have it. Perhaps that's why many who do have it (whatever ""it"" is) but who live and work around those who do not scarcely try. Among those who do try are those strange and mystifying people: converts.

By ""convert"" I do not mean the person who changes his or her religion for some practical reason -- to appease a spouse, or to satisfy this or that aesthetic preference -- but rather the person who claims to have encountered a personal God and to have developed a relationship with Him that has so altered his life and character that even his nonreligious friends are struck by the transformation. Such conversion stories are as dramatic as they are distinct. And the story of Sohrab Ahmari, an Iranian-American journalist and opinion editor of the New York Post, is no exception.

In his mid thirties, Ahmari is rather young to be writing a memoir. But spiritual memoir is a category of its own; after all, St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux's famous Story of a Soul was published after her death at only 24. Ahmari's memoir is of general interest, too: He has so far led an unusually interesting life. His career as a journalist spans three continents -- Asia, North America, and Europe. And his intellectual formation has been influenced by at least three worldviews -- Shiite Islam, Communism, and then, via a mysterious leap of faith, Roman Catholicism.

Anyone born in Iran after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when the shah's monarchy was overthrown and replaced by an Islamic ""republic"" in the form of a totalitarian theocracy, grew up in perilous times. Ahmari notes that many Iranians, not least his own grandfather, view the United States and other Western countries as illicit aggressors. His grandfather espoused ""a paranoid history of the world, in which Iranians or Muslims had invented everything that was worthwhile, only to have their ideas and resources pillaged by the West.""

Ahmari has a different view, one he seems to have intuited even in childhood, when he secretly cherished Star Wars memorabilia and GI Joe action figures. Now Ahmari considers the reign of the autocratic shah to have been ""benign,"" lauds the West as the home of freedom (he immigrated to the U.S. with his mother at the age of 13), and harbors deep distrust of what he considers to be the necessarily political nature of Islamic theology, which leaves ""little room for the individual conscience and free will, for the human heart, for reason and intellect.""

Ahmari recalls the formal Shiite education of his childhood: the uncompromising rule of sharia law, a fierce hostility toward Sunni Muslims, the gulf between his family's religious apathy at home and their mandated religious observance in public, the scrutiny of the morality police. He began to ""curse God"" privately, just to see what would happen (as far as he could tell, nothing much did). He writes:

Living in an Islamic theocracy -- where God appears in the form of floggings and judicial amputations, scowling ayatollahs and secret police -- has a way of souring one on things divine. Years later, I read a wise young Iranian dissident who argued that if the Islamic Republic collapsed one day it would leave behind the world's largest community of atheists. This is a perfectly plausible theory.

By the time he and his mother settled in America, Ahmari was a budding atheist. Like many teenagers, he began his search for truth in rebellion. Arriving in Utah, he found America to be in some ways an improvement on Iran yet in other ways a disappointment. While his mother, who had separated from his father in Iran, struggled to put food on the table and a roof over their heads (settling for a mobile home), he began his American education.

His contrarian streak had only strengthened. By his teenage years he was reading Sartre, Camus, and Nietzsche, responding to their ideas with half-baked thoughts and credulous zeal: ""This book is so right!"" ""Isn't it just so!"" Soon he turned his attention to Communism. Though he recognized the evil of Stalin, he admired Trotsky. He found Marx's theory of class struggle to be compelling, and by the age of 18 he was a ""card-carrying Communist.""

The irony that Ahmari, having been liberated from a repressive state and welcomed to one of the freest countries in the world, became besotted with Marxism is not lost on him. ""I drove my new Honda Civic to Salt Lake, where I was to meet the Worker's Alliance crew,"" he writes. ""I had purchased the car with earnings from a part-time market research job.""

Of course, there is nothing particularly remarkable about a youthful fling with bad ideas. After all, at college, who doesn't try to match his beliefs to his lifestyle rather than the other way around? Drinking, drugs, hookups -- all are permissible, if not worthwhile. All very convenient. And all a bit dull. What is far more interesting is how deep-rooted Ahmari's conscience and wide-searching his intellectual curiosity were even in this youthful stage.

As Ahmari details, the primary attraction of Marxism, much like that of today's identity politics, is the same as that of religion itself: All offer a structure of meaning, an anthropology of the human person, and a means to salvation. In this sense, such ideologies are but secular religions. Under Communism, humanity is not separated into sheep and goats but into oppressed and oppressors. The individual is not a sinner betrayed by his own will and redeemed through Christ, but a saint betrayed by the powerful and saved through revolution and redistribution. While Christianity calls for the voluntary transformation of the individual, Communism seeks the involuntary transformation of the collective. The former seeks to persuade, the latter to impose.

Over time, partly by interacting with believers, Ahmari's anti-theism mellowed into atheism, his atheism into agnosticism, and finally his agnosticism was transformed into a belief in the person and teachings of Jesus Christ and in his ""one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church.""

As an ambitious London-based journalist for the Wall Street Journal, Ahmari reported on an Afghan smuggling ring in Istanbul, where he began to see the abuse of human rights as irrefutable evidence of the reality of sin -- and, more, as a reflection ""in externalized and concentrated form [of] my own miserable spiritual state."" In this regard, the key to Ahmari's conversion is, presumably, the key to most conversions: humility.

In some parts of the book it is unclear whom, exactly, Ahmari is writing for. Is this memoir also intended as apologetics, like C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity? Is it a mission statement for the rest of his life? A confession like that of his confirmation saint, Augustine? Some sections would interest a general reader -- indeed, anyone who appreciates eloquent prose and a compelling story -- while others make sense only in a spiritual context. But if the jump between nonbelief and belief is jarring, it is inevitably so.

In his essay ""Why I Am a Catholic,"" G. K. Chesterton writes that, while he ""might treat the matter personally"" and describe his own conversion, he has a ""strong feeling that this method makes the business look much smaller than it really is."" This seems right. The reason Chesteron was a Catholic involved ten thousand reasons, which all merged into one earth-shattering belief: that Catholicism was true. That, I presume, is the same for Ahmari. And that, I suppose, is what's meant by faith.

"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Wednesday called out critics of President Trump who are using his remarks about the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to attack him.

""A lot of people are coming to John's defense now that called him crazy and a war mongerer, so it's kind of interesting to see the politics of how this dispute's being used to bash Trump by people who are against both Trump and McCain,"" he said, according to ABC News.

Trump has criticized McCain over the past several days, after reports surfaced that McCain had asked one of his aides to distribute the Democrat-funded and Fusion GPS-produced dossier that claimed collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the days after the 2016 election.

Trump critics have been calling on Republicans to speak out against Trump's criticism of McCain, and particularly on Graham, a close friend of McCain.

Graham said during the interview that he did not like Trump's comments on McCain, but that it would not stop him from working with the president.

Graham said:

I love John McCain. I traveled the world with him. I learned a lot from him. He's an American hero and nothing will diminish that. I think the president's comments about Senator McCain hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of Senator McCain.

I'm going to try to continue to help the president. A lot of people are coming to John's defense now that called him crazy and a war mongerer, so it's kind of interesting to see the politics of how this dispute's being used to bash Trump by people who are against both Trump and McCain.

My job is to represent the people of South Carolina. They want me to work with the president where I can. I've gotten to know the president. We have a good working relationship. I like him. I don't like it when he says things about my friend John McCain. And I think the best thing that can happen, I think for all of us, is to move forward and focus on the challenges.

Trump explained his attacks at an event at a U.S. Army tank plant in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, citing a litany of complaints that included the dossier and McCain's ""no"" vote on repealing Obamacare.

""So now what we can say, now we're all set -- I don't think I have to answer that question but the press keeps [asking], 'What do you think of McCain, what do you think?'"" Trump concluded. ""Not my kind of guy, but some people like him and I think that's great.""",184,Breitbart,Graham: A Lot of People Now Defending McCain Called Him 'Crazy'
"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand - Only a week after attacks on two mosques in New Zealand killed 50 worshippers, the country has banned sales of ""military-style"" semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.

In the world of politics, it's a lightning fast response, especially when compared to the deeply contentious, long-running gun control debate in the United States.

The suddenness of Thursday's ban, which came as the dead were being buried, has raised many questions, especially for those not familiar with firearms.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that ""every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack last Friday will be banned."" She said that includes ""military-style"" semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines.

Ardern said a sales ban was effective immediately to prevent stockpiling and would be followed by a complete ban on the weapons after new laws are rushed through.

The ban includes any semi-automatic guns or shotguns that are capable of being used with a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds. It also extends to accessories used to convert guns into what the government called ""military-style"" weapons.

Many different types of firearms, from pistols to rifles and shotguns, can be semi-automatic. Semi-automatic refers to a firearm's ability to self-load, not only firing a bullet with each trigger pull, but also reloading and making the firearm capable of firing again.

The ban does not include semi-automatic .22 caliber or smaller guns that hold up to 10 rounds or semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns with non-detachable magazines that hold up to five rounds. The guns not banned are commonly used by farmers and hunters.

Caliber is the measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel. A higher caliber firearm uses larger rounds that can do more tissue damage and are more lethal.

The government said the police and military would be exempt, as would businesses carrying out professional pest control. Access for international shooting competitions would also be considered.

Ardern said people could hand over their guns under an amnesty while officials develop a formal buyback scheme, which could cost up to 200 million New Zealand dollars ($140 million).

New Zealand police said on their website that the ""transitional period"" would allow people to arrange to hand over their unlawful firearms to police without penalties. It encouraged people to fill out an online form and said after that police would be in touch to make arrangements.

There could be legal exemptions to the ban, such as for pest controllers, but Ardern said any exemptions would be ""tightly regulated.""

""For other dealers, sales should essentially now cease. My expectation is that these weapons will now be returned to your suppliers and never enter into the New Zealand market again,"" she said.

There are nearly 250,000 licensed gun owners in New Zealand, which has a population of 5 million people. Officials estimate there are 1.5 million guns in the country.

Sydney University gun policy expert Philip Alpers estimated that only 6 percent of all weapons in New Zealand were registered.

He said there could be 500,000 semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. But, he added, ""only a small proportion of those would be capable of taking a large-capacity magazine. So that's the number that everyone is trying to guess.""

The ban is widely supported and puts New Zealand ""almost exactly in line"" with Australia, the United Kingdom and ""somewhat with Canada,"" according to Professor Kevin Clements, chairman of Peace and Conflicts studies at the University of Otago and a firearms expert.

One of New Zealand's largest gun retailers, Hunting & Fishing New Zealand, said it supports ""any government measure to permanently ban such weapons.""

The company said it would no longer stock any assault-style firearms of any category and would also stop selling firearms online.

""What (Ardern's) done is a very brave move, and it's the kind of move that can only be done in a common-law country where guns are not a right. Guns are a real privilege. If there was a legal right like there is in the United States, this would be much more difficult,"" said International law Professor Alexander Gillespie of Waikato University.

But, he added, ""it's going to be expensive, and there's going to be a lot of pushback.""

Alpers noted that New Zealand, although it requires handgun registration, ""is still the only country apart from the United States and to some degree Canada that doesn't have (firearm) registration as its third pillar of gun control"" along with licensing and treating possession as a conditional privilege.

Alpers said rifles and shotguns aren't registered in the country.

He called that ""a very important loophole"" but said Ardern ""has flagged her determination to pursue registration. Whether she'll be able to do it completely or not ... is another question.""

"President Trump pressures GM to save the Lordstown General Motor plant which was shuttered as part of a major company overhaul; reaction from Mayor Arno Hill.

About two weeks ago I stood with others in the bitter cold across from the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio. We were there to honor generations of workers who built cars in the factory for over 50 years. We gathered to witness the last Chevy Cruze shipment dispatched after the last shift ended at 3 p.m.

GM Lordstown has sustained the local economy of my hometown for decades. So watching what may be the last workers leave after assembling the last car was a bit like going to a wake for a close friend.

The mood was somber. The bone-chilling air was heavy with a mixture of sadness and uncertainty. Grown men and women, including me, wiped tears from our eyes as we tried to come to terms with the hard times that lay ahead for a community with a history filled with heartache and broken promises.

LOCAL UAW LEADER RESPONDS TO TRUMP TWEET: 'I'M TRYING TO STAY OUT OF THE FEUD'

The Mahoning Valley, in the heart of Northeast Ohio, is no stranger to facing tough times. Those of us who come from the valley see ourselves as fighters who are relentless in the face of adversity. We are doers, but we are also dreamers who want to believe in the promise of a better tomorrow.

It was no surprise that voters in the valley supported Donald Trump for president in 2016. Many people believed that Trump, the billionaire who said he was a world-class negotiator, would fight to keep jobs like the ones at GM Lordstown in the United States.

What did come as a surprise was President Trump's half-hearted response to the mothballing of the Lordstown plant. Last November, General Motors announced it would be ceasing production of the Chevy Cruze in March, leaving 1,600 people without jobs - 1,600 families whose lives hang in the balance.

The president did not visit the Lordstown GM plant, although he knows how serious the situation is in the community. However, he attended a political fundraising event for his re-election campaign in Canton, Ohio that raised about $3 million.

Since that announcement, President Trump has offered some tough talk, taking swipes at GM CEO Mary Barra and making demands for a new product to replace the Cruze in Lordstown. Just this week, Trump fired off a number of tweets about the fate of the Lordstown plant, blaming everyone from GM's corporate leadership to the local head of the United Auto Workers union.

Back at home, many were surprised that Trump would attack the local workers for Lordstown's closure. After all, Trumbull County, where Lordstown is located, voted for Trump in 2016. He was the first Republican to carry the county since 1928.

More importantly, as I can attest from personal knowledge, there is no truth behind the assertion that the local UAW is to blame for putting plant operations on ice.

UAW Local 1112 (and previously UAW Local 1714) had given concessions and negotiated in good faith with GM in order to help keep the plant open and profitable. Yet union leader Dave Green was singled out personally by President Trump to get his act together and produce.

People in Ohio know that the UAW members at Lordstown, along with their leadership, have been producing for years. Our UAW is not your grandfather's union. Furthermore, Green, in spite of being personally maligned by the president, has made it clear he would rather focus on working with Trump to bring jobs back than get into a petty fight over a tweet.

Green did not take the bait and respond in kind to Trump's attack on him while answering questions from the press. Green recognizes that it is more productive to find common ground and engage the president to help our area than to stir the pot.

Frankly, I think the local UAW is a great example of how labor unions remain relevant within our economy and our political system in the 21st century. Union voters crossed parties for Trump in many states across the industrial Midwest.

These voters are a necessary part of Trump's coalition to hold on to the White House. But they can also be the key to a Democratic victory should the party nominate a candidate who can win them back.

It is good to see that Trump has since tried to walk back his heavy-handed approach towards Lordstown. He now seems to be making more statements about bringing the jobs back rather than pointing fingers at who is to blame for their loss.

But President Trump still needs to do more to make it right, both in style and in substance.

The president visited Ohio Wednesday on the heels of his GM tweet storm and toured the Lima Army Tank Plant, where he again voiced criticism of the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. The Lima plant had faced possible closure, but remains open and is benefitting by higher defense spending by the federal government.

The president did not visit the Lordstown GM plant, although he knows how serious the situation is in the community. However, he attended a political fundraising event for his re-election campaign in Canton, Ohio that raised about $3 million. Donors paid a minimum of $2,800 to attend the event, while couples paying $70,000 got to have dinner with the president.

The high-dollar fundraiser at a country club was just about an hour away from the shuttered GM Lordstown plant. Swooping in for a gilded event in driving distance from a community that has just lost 1,600 jobs is a slap in the face to the people of the Mahoning Valley. It is bad optics and even worse politics.

Democratic presidential hopefuls are seizing on the opportunity to capitalize on this. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, made it a point to come from Cleveland to Lordstown to show his support.

Yes, this is likely a campaign stunt. But if President Trump does not do something tangible to show the Lordstown community he is serious about fighting for local jobs he runs the risk of losing support in 2020 to someone who is at least pretending to care.

"Now and then, William F. Buckley Jr. used the phrase ""infield practice,"" which was strange, because he did not really care for sports -- except sailing. I asked my brother-in-law, who is a sailor, ""Is sailing a sport?"" He answered, ""Simple rule for me: It's a sport if you know you've won when you cross the finish line. Sorry to all the ice-dancers in the world.""

Back to WFB -- who attended his first Major League Baseball game in 1994, when he was nearly 70. Ira Glasser, the head of the ACLU, took him to Opening Day at Shea Stadium (where the New York Mets played). The two rode out to the park together via subway. WFB had not been on a subway train since 1965, when he ran for mayor. In that campaign, he made a ceremonial appearance on a train.

How did he get home from Shea, by the way? The usual: limo.

A few years later, Glasser took him to his second baseball game: a Yankee game. That would prove the final one. I know only one story about that evening. WFB told it to us. After an inning or so, he went to get a beer. The young woman behind the counter asked for ID. Dumbfounded, blinking, WFB said, ""I'm 74 years old.""

He hated officiousness, or blind rule-following.

WFB may not have been much for baseball, or sports in general, but he loved language, and ""infield practice"" tickled his fancy. He would use it to indicate the fielding of basic questions (or the posing of them, I suppose). He might say, for example, ""The BBC called this morning. I had a little infield practice on American conservatism.""

Well, I had a little infield practice myself a while ago, with a bright and engaging fellow from the Smithsonian Institution. He was asking about the arts, and his opening question was ...

What makes a work of art truly great? Durability, most people would say. A great work lasts -- lives on and on -- rather than sparkling and then fizzling out. Also, a great work should touch the heart or stir the mind. And maybe point to something higher, or deeper.

When is it safe to call a work of art great? Sometimes never. But if you are confident of your judgment, safety is not a consideration. WFB liked to quote Stravinsky, who said that it takes 50 years, after a work's creation, to assess that work properly. I don't know. With some of them, you know quickly (one way or the other). But Stravinsky and Buckley had a point nonetheless.

What role does great art play in society? Some societies prize it more than others. The same is true of individuals. Not everything appeals to everybody. WFB was not much for sports. Some are not much for the Great Outdoors. Woody Allen said, ""I am two with nature."" I know people in classical music who are always trying to make classical music popular. ""Don't waste your time,"" I say. ""There's a reason they call pop music 'pop music,' you know: It's popular."" Classical music will never be popular. But that's all right: There will always be a minority who cherish it, and keep it going.

So, in your view, the arts are something that people can take or leave? There is not a societal need for art? Look, I think society would be poorer without art, because art enriches the soul. It breathes beauty into life. It can take us above the muck (or not). But this is a matter of individual choice, or leanings. There will always be art-lovers in society -- always -- and others who are indifferent. The others will probably be in the majority.

You can't make everyone conform to your tastes. That's what a lot of people don't understand. I'm always quoting Homer -- not the Greek poet, but Homer Simpson. When Apu was worried about impending fatherhood, Homer said, ""Kids are the best. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all.""

People are always trying to get others to love what they love and hate what they hate. Well, good luck.

But everyone should have an appreciation of art, right? ""Should"" is an interesting word. In one sense, we should all have pretty prom dates and Corvettes. I think everyone should be exposed to art -- and sports and science and everything else.

What would you require in schools? Many things, a variety of things -- a smorgasbord. Again, exposure. I think of Marian the Librarian, describing her ideal man: ""If occasionally he'd ponder what makes Shakespeare and Beethoven great ..."" That's enough, I think. They need not be fanatics, like some of us. Lead a horse to water -- many waters -- and let him drink what he will.

Some people think that arts are necessary, societally, as a protection against tyranny. I think that's a nice idea -- but way off. There are lots of artists who are SOBs. That includes great artists. They are not automatically liberal democrats, far from it. Think of all those Nazis, and all those Communists! For that matter, think of Hitler and Stalin, personally! There have seldom been two greater art-lovers. Everyone knows about Hitler's devotion to Wagner. But he really loved The Merry Widow, that fizzy, adorable thing. He saw it over and over, and bestowed awards on the composer, Leh√°r.

In order to be appreciated, does art need to be relevant to a person's life? I don't know what that means. I think ""relevant"" is one of the great nonsense words of our time. Is Bach's B Minor Mass relevant? Relevant to what? It's great. Is greatness relevant? As I see it, art can be liked and loved. It can instruct us, console us, thrill us, elevate us. But this mania, this fashion, this craze for relevance (whatever that means) is bizarre.

It is also a perversion of art, possibly. I suspect it goes hand in hand with attempts to politicize art. A lot of people think that if something isn't political, it does not really matter. These are shallow people. By ""relevant,"" they may well mean ""political.""

What's the relevance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony? The last movement features a hymn to brotherhood, true. But the Ninth is also ... you know: a symphony in D minor. Music. Such art has a power beyond words, beyond human concepts.

You are talking about old art, though -- art created centuries ago. What about today? Does art have a special responsibility today? I don't know. Art is art, it seems to me. Good and bad (and in between). Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is fresh as a daisy. It speaks loud and clear to me, and millions of others. This music is unstaling. So is Bach's B Minor Mass, which is even older than that symphony.

But, in reality, both of those works are ageless. They are beyond time and place, like great art in general. In China, people are on fire with music -- classical music, Western classical music. This music is more popular, surely, in China and the rest of the East Asia than it is in the West, where it was composed.

Years ago, I asked Lorin Maazel, the great conductor, about the future of classical music. The first words out of his mouth were, ""Thank God for China.""

You will concede that politics has a place in art, right? Many artists think it is incumbent on them to deal with the politics of their day. To make directly political art. Is there such a thing as political art? There's art with politics in it. Most of the time, I think it's pretty boring, because, somehow, the art takes a backseat to politics. And the politics is of a hectoring quality.

Politics is often a spoiler of art, because of that very quality: ""Eat your peas."" It may well be that political art is yet another excuse for people to lecture. (Lecturing has its time and place, needless to say.) Better, I think, is to do things subtly. I like a movie that way, for example. A movie may convey a message -- a great many of them do. But you don't have to do it in a honkingly obvious way. Weave it in, you know?

I think of Shakespeare, which is cheating, because he is the greatest of all artists, but let's do it anyway. Many of his plays are political -- or rather, they have politics in them. But the art of them transcends the politics. The politics means practically nothing to us today. Same with Verdi's operas, some of them. Un ballo in maschera is stuffed with politics -- but we don't give a damn about that, and rightly so. The music and the human drama are what counts.

A major topic when it comes to the arts today is representation. When museums or Hollywood studios or other gatekeepers of art present works by underprivileged groups -- I don't think groups make art. Individuals do. Fine. When gatekeepers present artists from underprivileged groups, doesn't that help new audiences to engage? Possibly, yes. But I think that, as a rule, art is independent of race, ethnicity, and sex. If you have extra appreciation of a symphony, let's say, because it's by a woman, that's you. This is an individual matter, a matter of perception. But, in my view, music ought to rise and fall on its own. The notes don't know who composed them.

Or, as Duke Ellington said, if it sounds good, it is good.

Sure, but what about the visual arts? Don't you think people like to look at pictures of people who look like them? Doesn't that make them feel connected to the art? I can see that, of course. A person gets the sense that this stuff is for him, not just other people. And yet: If you think a Rembrandt self-portrait is nothing but a picture of an old, white Dutchman, that's pathetic.

Americans are drunk on race, ethnicity, and sex -- gender, people say today. They wear race-ethnicity-gender goggles. We're taught that way in school. We are taught to see everything through this prism of race-ethnicity-gender. This is almost the American religion -- and a tragedy, I think.

A few years ago, a high-school English teacher in Sacramento made some news. She complained that Common Core required her to teach Shakespeare, and this was not fair, she said, to her ""very ethnically diverse and wonderfully curious modern-day students."" Shakespeare, she explained, ""lived in a pretty small world."" Has anyone, in the long history of man, ever lived in a bigger world?

I thought of Maya Angelou, who, when she was very young, figured Shakespeare must have been a black girl. ""How else could he know so well how I feel?"" Think, too, of W. E. B. Du Bois, in his Souls of Black Folk (1903):

I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the color line I move arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas. . . . I summon Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all graciously. . . . So, wed with Truth, I dwell above the Veil.

Can art reach everybody? High art, that is? Is anyone exempt from its touch, its powers? I doubt it. But some people wall themselves off, I think, even if unwittingly. Let me tell you a story. For me it was jarring, and disturbing.

Last December 16, I jotted a little tweet: ""Today is Beethoven's birthday. Rarely has one man contributed so much to the world. As Lorin Maazel said, he is your best friend, with you through thick and thin. A great, great gift to mankind. 'Simply a gift from God,' as a teacher of mine used to say.""

There were various responses to this tweet. Many agreed. Many said things like ""Mozart is better."" And then there were tweets like this: ""We get it, you're high-brow. We get it."" And, ""Ooh, you're just so smart, aren't you?""

This kind of reaction is full of contempt, but it also may reflect some pain, resentment, and even shame. And you know who is a great antidote to these things? To pain, resentment, and related ills? Beethoven. He fought against them himself, his whole life long.

Let's talk government. You're not for government funding of the arts or other governmental involvement, right? Correct. Generally speaking, I don't think that our central government should be a funder or arbiter of the arts, handing out goodies, including money and honors. I am wary of official art. Frankly, I don't like the idea of a poet laureate in America, even when I like the poet who holds the job.

There's an old line: ""He who pays the piper, calls the tune."" Who should be calling the tune? The feds?

As for governmental awards in the arts, I find them a little creepy. I think they belong to monarchies and dictatorships, not to us. Not to our American republic. Let Napoleon hand out awards! I don't think that we should have ""official artists"" or anything that smells of them.

Years ago, an important figure in the government called me to ask for advice on whom to give certain music awards to. Clearing my throat, I said, ""Well, you know, I'm a little uneasy about these awards."" ""Yeah, yeah,"" he said, ""I know what you mean, but they're going to be given out anyway, so they might as well go to good and deserving people. That's why I'm calling you.""

All right. But still ...

Wealthy communities get to experience art all the time. What about poor communities? Well, to begin with, there has never been so much art available, in all human history. YouTube alone is swimming in it. Aristocrats of the past -- the Esterh√°zys, for example (Haydn's patrons) -- would faint with joy. On beholding the Internet, the librarians at Alexandria would expire.

Okay, but you would agree that there's nothing like experiencing art firsthand: a gallery, a ballet, a concert. I agree 100 percent. The main problem, I think, is lack of interest, not lack of money. Could I tell you a story?

Many years ago, I was interviewing a great singer, who was repeating the usual line that our public schools are starved of money. There's just not enough money for the arts, he said. I knew this was nonsense, because per-pupil spending is through the roof, but I seldom argue with an interviewee. I said, ""Tell me about your own music education, early on."" ""Oh, it was great!"" he said. ""The principal of our school was a wonderful woman who doubled as the music teacher. We went down into the basement for music hour. We didn't even have a piano, just a pitch pipe. But, boy, did we learn.""

That didn't take any money, did it? No -- just someone who cared. Someone who gave a damn, someone who was willing and able to impart some music to the next generation.

I am no despiser of money. Money is good, poverty is bad. But what is most needed, I think -needed in the arts -- is parents, teachers, and others who simply care. That's what will keep the arts burning, for those who want it.",187,nationalreview.com,The Arts: Who Needs 'Em? | National Review
"Why does Mallon think readers might want to revisit those days when real patriots ordered ""freedom fries"" with their cheeseburgers? Nostalgia for any time other than this one.

Nostalgia is what Thomas Mallon is counting on to help draw readers to his new novel, Landfall, which takes them on a long stroll down memory lane, back to the golden days of . . . President George W. Bush's second term. Really. So, if Mallon's wonderfully entertaining romp attracts the attention it deserves, it will be partly because, considered in the light of current conditions, it was, comparatively speaking, a golden age when:

The 43rd president was promoting his ""freedom agenda"" (""As freedom takes root in Iraq, it will inspire millions across the Middle East to claim their liberty as well""), while Iraq was being enveloped in ""the insurgency,"" a.k.a. barbarism, becoming the abattoir that the ""Axis of Weasel"" (France and others unenthusiastic about ""the coalition of the willing"") had feared. (One of Mallon's characters is propositioned by a man who suggests to her a ""coition of the willing."") Hurricane Katrina revealed the government's competence to be approximately what most people think it is. Speaking of natural disasters, North Carolina's Democratic senator John Edwards (of whom a Mallon character says, ""Somebody ghost writes this guy's conversation."") used prostrated New Orleans as the launching pad for his campaign to become the 44th president. Harriet Miers was proposed to sit on the nation's highest bench, where justices named Marshall, Harlan, Holmes, Taft, Cardozo, Brandeis, and Jackson have sat. Congress, egged on by conservatives who misplaced their suspicion of intrusive government, waded into a family dispute over the medical care that should be provided to Terri Schiavo, who had been diagnosed as ""persistently vegetative.""

So, why does Mallon think readers might want to revisit those days when real patriots ordered ""freedom fries"" with their cheeseburgers? To repeat: nostalgia for any time other than this one. If Mallon is right, then the most unlikely president has had the unlikely effect of rendering a service to something that is, to him, only a rumor: literature. On the eve of the 2016 election, Mallon wrote in The New Yorker:

As we got deep into 2016, the Iraq insurgency and Hurricane Katrina came to feel almost like refuges. So did the political discourse of the early two-thousands: I invite you, in our current ghost-tweeted political era, to go back just eight years, to the Facebook postings of Sarah Palin, and tell me that they do not now read like a lost volume of 'The Federalist Papers.'

""In narrative and dialogue,"" Mallon says, his novel ""tries not to reconstruct actuality but to reimagine it."" Some might question the propriety of imagining the dialogue of Condoleezza Rice in bed with the Canadian foreign minister, but perhaps fiction is its own excuse. (William F. Buckley, in the first of his 22 novels, solved what he called the problem of the OSS -- the obligatory sex scene -- with a flourish by having his dashing protagonist, Blackford Oakes, say to Britain's queen at the climactic moment, ""Courtesy of the United States, ma'am."")

Mallon is a sort of Republican -- he often voted Republican, before the party became a cult -- and readers of Landfall will encounter an interestingly sympathetic portrait of Bush, with ""the fast gear-grinding of his moods, from third to reverse and back again,"" his stubbornness, and his occasionally unvarnished candor:

The U.S. representative to the six-party talks had declared: 'We are not going to live with a nuclear North Korea.'

""Bush frowned: 'What he said was diplo-speak for 'until we agree to do what I just said we wouldn't.'

Writing a novel, says Mallon, who has written ten of them, ""is inherently an exercise in empathy,"" something that is usually in short supply when Americans judge the people they put into power and hence into dilemmas. Mallon's many years in Washington, where ""the two chief conversational modes"" are ""argument and prediction,"" have not made him cynical. ""Extreme cynicism is,"" he says, ""its own kind of na√Øvet√©."" Certainly, people who are constantly and theatrically disillusioned about politics thereby confess to promiscuously embracing illusions.

Mallon, 67, has a Harvard Ph.D. and for many years was a professor of English. Perhaps it takes a novelist's eye to notice something that, once noticed, is stunning. ""Have you,"" asks Mallon, ""ever seen Donald Trump laugh?"" You probably have not. Think about that. Mallon probably will not think about it in a novel set in 2019, because characters worthy of appearing in serious novels are not too simple to discern life's incongruities, or too pompous to find them funny.",188,nationalreview.com,Thomas Mallon's 'Landfall' Is a Romp of a Novel
"Mary Mancini, chairwoman of the Tennessee Democratic Party, apologized this week after calling the state ""racist."" (Twitter/@marymancini)

The chairwoman of the Tennessee Democratic Party apologized this week for calling the state racist during a discussion of local politics and while promoting less conventional candidates.

Mary Mancini made the comment while speaking with the Coffee County Democratic Party earlier this month about how the party should put forward less conventional candidates, including black and Latinos, millennials and members of the LGBTQ community.

""We have a little bit of a problem in this state, and I'm just going to say it outright,"" Mancini said. ""This is a racist state.""

""We have a little bit of a problem in this state, and I'm just going to say it outright. This is a racist state.""

-- Mary Mancini, chairwoman, Tennessee Democratic Party

In another county party meeting, Mancini was heard on an audio recording calling Tennessee ""a very racist state.""

Mancini issued her apology in a statement to the Tennessean newspaper of Nashville.

""In the heat and the frustration of seeing and hearing the constant drumbeat of bigotry, misogyny and homophobia coming from the Republicans at the state legislature, I used a poor choice of words and vented my frustration and I apologize,"" Mancini said.

Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Scott Golden said it was disappointing that Mancini called the state racist, the paper reported. He said Republicans are working to ""lift all Tennesseans up,"" citing the state's economy and efforts to boost educational attainment.

Mancini said the GOP was causing division to be ""become ingrained"" in residents around the state. During her meeting with Coffee County Democrats, she suggested that Andrea Bond-Johnson, an African-American candidate for a seat in the state Legislature, couldn't win because the area has a small minority population.

""Two out of the three counties in that area are extraordinarily racist,"" Mancini told the group.

""I wasn't the only one who was told that we need to run someone who is not African-American in that district, because (some believed) an African-American cannot win in that district because white people will not vote for an African-American,"" Mancini said in an interview with the paper.

"""If I see somebody who's like, 'I'm moderate or conservative,' I keep swiping,"" Bronx resident Nadine Anglesey tells The Post. The 33-year-old art director hasn't dated a conservative since the 2016 election -- even if she's attracted to him. ""Yesterday, this one guy [on the dating app Hinge] seemed really great til I saw he marked himself as conservative,"" she says. ""I nipped that in the bud.""

Anglesey's not alone: Whether red or blue, most millennials would pick their party over the best lay of their life, according to new research.

The number of millennial men and women who prioritize political party alliance over good sex has skyrocketed since 2016, according to data from OkCupid. The matchmaking company surveyed more than eight million users, and found that interest in dating someone with similar political beliefs has gone up 165 percent since 2004, while having good sex has decreased as a priority 30 percent.

Specifically, between 2016 and 2018, the number of women who consider politics more important than sex shot up from 27 percent to 42 percent, while for men that needle moved from 23 percent to 30 percent.

So, what's the link? Manhattan sex therapist Megan Fleming thinks dating strictly within one's party is making people comfortable -- too comfortable.

""If you're only exposing yourself to people who think like you, you're living in a silo and missing out on opportunities,"" says Fleming. She believes that less intellectual tension could translate to less of a lustful spark in a relationship. She encourages her patients to get out of their comfort zone -- in love and in bed.

That was the case for Julie, a 27-year-old Brooklyn liberal and senior public relations manager who dated a Republican for three years. For the political opposites, Julie says, ""Everything was very extreme"" -- including the sex. After particularly frustrating, politically charged conversations, ""We'd have makeup sex"" that was ""better than normal,"" she says.

It wasn't enough to hold them together, and today Julie -- who declined to give her last name because of privacy reasons -- finds going out with fellow liberals ""a breath of fresh air."" But she misses the adventure of being with someone very different from herself. ""[We] enjoyed being challenged and challenging each other, and maybe that's something I'm still looking for,"" she says. She's currently single and open to being with a conservative again, depending on ""his beliefs.""

That's also true on the other side of the aisle. Adam Bandler, a 22-year-old Republican, says a date's political beliefs are barely even an issue for him. ""I don't really care how someone politically identifies,"" says the single NYU student, adding that ""political ideology"" isn't something he ""necessarily even considers"" in a potential mate.

That open-mindedness could pay off. Just ask Jen Winston, from Williamsburg, who says her most memorable time in the sack was with someone whose politics she deemed ""disgusting.""

""The best sex I've ever had was with a guy who I'm fairly sure was a Republican,"" says the 30-year-old Democrat. ""If I had known he was a Republican, I probably would not have engaged. But if I had known how good the sex was gonna be, I probably would have gone through with it still.""

Winston, who runs a feminist Instagram account called @girlpowersupply, isn't beating herself up over the party-line transgression. After all, ""Sex for pleasure is a form of self care,"" she says.",190,New York Post,Millennials care more about date's politics than good sex: survey
"London's left-wing mayor Sadiq Khan has said that neither independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, nor any of the Democrats who have announced a run for president, will beat incumbent Donald J. Trump in 2020.

""I think the next president hasn't declared yet,"" Mr Khan said in an interview with HuffPost UK published Tuesday.

The Labour progressive, highly critical of the America First President and demanded his summer 2018 UK visit be cancelled, added, ""And I think, it's not going to be Trump. It can't be Trump.""

Amongst the Democrats who have thrown their hat in the ring that Khan has dismissed includes former Texas congressman Robert 'Beto' O'Rourke.

Mr O'Rourke, married to a real estate heiress, launched his presidential campaign last week and has come out in support of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal and third trimester abortions if women want them.

It was revealed Tuesday that after losing his 16th district congressional seat to Republican Ted Cruz, O'Rourke reportedly ate dirt fabled to possess ""regenerative powers.""

Aware that champagne socialists lack the common touch, Mr Khan went on to advise any progressive Democrat planning to run against President Trump that they would need to work to develop an ""emotional connection"" with the average American.

""What one of the challenges -- and I've said this, I've got some friends in the Democratic party in America -- is you've got to recognise the reasons why people supported [President Trump] and why people still support him,"" Mr Khan said.

""One of the mistakes we make as politicians is we only spend time with like-minded people. We are like an echo chamber,"" he added.

Mr Khan has come under fire from the President for saying there was no reason ""to be alarmed"" in reaction to a deadly Islamist terror attack on London Bridge in June 2017, the President saying, ""We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse... At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'""

The President has also highlighted London's spiralling crime under Khan's watch, saying the Labour mayor has done a ""terrible job in London.""

President Trump, an Anglophile and patriot-nationalist, has consistently backed Brexit and the choice of the British people to leave the EU, while the British capital's own mayor is holding out high hopes that in these turbulent past few weeks in British politics the UK will reverse the people's decision and remain in the bloc.",191,Breitbart,"London's Khan: Bernie Sanders, Beto Can't Beat Trump"

It isn't exactly breaking news that New York's Republican Party is in ""abysmal"" shape, concedes Frank Morano at Crain's New York.

Only this time, Pelosi is firmly on board. How ironic, says Rosen, that ""at a time when society seems inclined to indulge young people's desire to languish in an extended twilight childhood,"" voting ""is the only adult responsibility for which Democrats think children are prepared."" Indeed, there are moves to raise the age of criminal responsibility, gun ownership and smoking because ""children are more prone to make bad choices -- or no choices at all -- owing to a lack of experience."" Children probably need ""more experiences approximating those"" of adulthood,"" but voting isn't one of them.

"BANGKOK - Prayuth Chan-ocha became prime minister in a very Thai way: He led a military coup.

Now after five years of running Thailand with absolute power, he's seeking to hold on to the top job through the ballot box. The military's thinly veiled proxy party has put forward Prayuth as its nominee for prime minister after Sunday's election.

""He knows he can't be a dictator like this forever,"" said Prajak Kongkirati, a political science lecturer at Bangkok's Thammasat University. ""He wants to gain more legitimacy and that's why he's holding the elections. He wants to return as a prime minister under normal politics.""

After toppling the elected government in May 2014 with a pledge to ""return happiness to the people,"" Prayuth outlawed criticism of his regime and vowed the country would not have elections as long as there was dissent. He promised elections and then delayed them every year he was in power.

That's given Prayuth time to smooth out some rough edges. He's shed some awkward military stiffness, while keeping a general's swagger. He's worn increasingly well-tailored suits -- for which his wife takes credit -- and, as pressure for an election mounted, largely transformed himself into the Thai equivalent of your typical baby-kissing politician.

He can boast some accomplishments during his time at the helm, most notably cleaning up the aviation, fishing and wildlife industries -- which had put Thailand at peril of foreign economic sanctions -- along with stepping up the fight against human trafficking, which also risked trade retaliation.

Running the show has been fairly smooth though thanks to his government's clampdown on opponents, the rubberstamp legislature he hand-picked and the law he enacted making all of his actions legal.

Should he remain prime minister after the election, he will be without what he refers to as his ""special powers"" and his patience could be tested as he has to deal with actual elected lawmakers who may be unwilling to dance to his tune.

""He has a strong personality, vigorous, and direct. If he tries to become a politician, he could try to change but he would never really be able to change 100 percent,"" said Supparuek Tongchairith, a veteran military beat reporter for Thai Rath, the country's largest-circulation newspaper. ""Because his boiling point is low, if anyone pokes at him, he will explode. And for him to sit in the parliament, I guarantee, he will run into troubles.""

Prayuth's situation is inextricably tied to Thailand's last 13 years of political tumult.

In one respect he has been the instrument of the conservative forces in Thai society. They could not accept the rise of billionaire politician Thaksin Shinawatra, whose populist policies after being elected prime minister in 2001 threatened to unravel the country's long-established power structure: Bangkok-oriented, devoted to the monarchy and safeguarded by the military.

Prayuth, 65, was born and raised in an army family at a military camp in the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima. He attended a military preparatory school and graduated from Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, Thailand's West Point.

Prayuth was already a senior figure in the army when it staged a 2006 coup against Thaksin, justifying its action with allegations against him of abuse of power, self-enrichment and corruption that had triggered large protests. Some suggested that Thaksin sought to usurp the monarchy's place in Thai society.

Instead of easing tensions, the coup set off a bitter and often violent struggle for power between Thaksin's supporters and his opponents. Thaksin had his fortune and newly empowered poor and rural followers on his side; arrayed against him were the courts and the military, deeply loyal to the monarchy, which traditionally has been the country's most influential institution.

It was in this period that Prayuth climbed the ladder to the top of the military hierarchy. As commander of the First Army Region, he helped lead the bloody suppression of pro-Thaksin demonstrators in central Bangkok in 2010. In October that year, he became the army commander-in-chief.

After abandoning a sham effort to mediate between the Thaksin-backed government and its opponents who had been staging violent protests against it, Prayuth and the leaders of the other armed forces announced they were seizing power on May 22, 2014.

Prayuth and his junta spelled out their major tasks, including brokering national reconciliation and enacting reforms across Thai society to save the nation from what is said was the inherent corruption of politicians.

The leaders of the 2006 coup restored electoral democracy after about a year in power only to see Thaksin's allies bounce back.

It quickly became evident that this junta had no intention of allowing any Thaksin-allied party from coming to power again and that any attempts at reconciliation were going to be one-sided.

Under Prayuth's junta, called the National Council for Peace and Order, many civil liberties were curbed and military courts judged civilian political offenders. Government critics were summoned, or sometimes snatched off the streets, for ""attitude adjustment"" at army camps, a week or so in detention at an army base with a stern lecture to elicit a promise not to do it again. Longer term measures, such as a new constitution and election laws fashioned to handicap Thaksin's political machine, were also enacted.

Prayuth, who was unanimously elected prime minister by his appointed legislature, has a famously quick temper and can bristle at anyone who questions him. Couple that with a sometimes off-color sense of humor and it can lead to verbal attacks, gaffes or just plain bizarre moments.

He's jokingly told reporters he would have them executed, quipped that he might behead a soap opera star who called for elections, flung a banana peel at a cameraman and given an entire news conference in which he fondled the ear of a nearby sound technician.

Since the coup, the general has also drawn attention for his songwriting, penning a number of sappy ballads with nationalistic lyrics.

Prayuth -- who has twin daughters, now grown, who for a time were in a pop band called Badz -- has at times taken on the role of tough-love dad, especially during his weekly primetime television broadcast aired on all major Thai stations, ""Returning Happiness to the People."" The monologues can last an hour and half and touch on everything from the moral responsibility of youth to tips on cultivating orchids.

Yet allegations of nepotism against Prayuth's own relatives have led to uncomfortable accusations of hypocrisy. After the coup, a company owned by one of Prayuth's nephews that had no track record of projects was awarded lucrative army construction contracts. Prayuth's brother, also a former high-ranking army man, drew criticism when it was revealed that he made another son who had no military experience to an army officer.

Of course the most glaring contradiction may be Prayuth's own transformation.

As it became more likely he would seek to stay on as prime minister, he began allying with the very politicians he initially declared were the targets of junta reforms and launched government handouts that were nearly carbon copies of Thaksin's populist policies.

Early last year he made it clear, telling reporters: ""I am no longer a soldier. Understood? I'm just a politician who used to be a soldier.""

"Commentators like Jill Lepore are wrong to say America has no shared cultural heritage or core.

Jill Lepore, of Harvard and The New Yorker, has produced a provocative piece for Foreign Affairs, part of a special section to the magazine on the resurgence of nationalism. Lepore's contribution enjoins us, as Foreign Affairs editor Gideon Rose puts it, ""not to resist nationalism but to reappropriate it."" Indeed, Lepore calls for nothing less than ""a new Americanism and a new American history.""

The problem, as Lepore sees it, is that around the 1970s, the country's historians turned away from writing about the American nation because of an aversion to the evils of nationalism. The writing of history moved into a new era, focused on the experiences and cultures of national sub-groups and the promise of supranational globalization. But that left a big hole in the national consciousness. Lepore quotes historian Thomas Bender: ""A history in common is fundamental to sustaining the affiliation that constitutes national subjects. Nations are, among other things, a collective agreement, partly coerced, to affirm a common history as the basis for a shared future.""

And with historians abandoning the task of probing our history, Lepore asks who will provide ""a legible past and a plausible future -- a nation -- to the people who lived in the United States?"" Lepore's answer: ""Charlatans, stooges, and tyrants."" She elaborates:

The endurance of nationalism proves that there's never any shortage of blackguards willing to prop up people's sense of themselves and their destiny with a tissue of myths and prophecies, prejudices and hatreds, or to empty out old rubbish bags full of festering resentments and calls to violence. When historians abandon the study of the nation, when scholars stop trying to write a common history for a people, nationalism doesn't die. Instead, it eats liberalism.

In other words, if the good guys abandon history, the bad guys will prevail.

Lepore displays her usual erudition and elegance of prose in promoting her liberal national narrative. But ultimately this is a flawed analysis. Like many other liberal historians today, her vision of America, past and future, centers almost exclusively on creedal elements of the American system -- democratic principles, human rights, pluralism. As a result, she gives a distorted picture of the origins of the American nation.

She takes pains to debunk the notion that America was built with any sense of a shared heritage born of a common ethnic background. ""The fiction that its people shared a common ancestry was absurd on its face; they came from all over,"" she writes. She adds that, having just won a war against the British, the last thing they wanted to celebrate was their ""Britishness.""

Lepore backs this up with nothing -- no crucial quotes from prominent early Americans, no demographic data. In fact, in 1700, America was 83 percent British in origin, with other Northern European peoples encompassing another 6 percent (this excludes American Indians, who were not allowed to play any role in building the civic structures of the Colonies). By 1755, after an influx of German and Dutch settlers, the continent was still 68 percent British, with another 12 percent other Northern Europeans who blended easily into the majority Anglo-Saxon modality. The other 20 percent were Africans, mostly slaves.

These Europeans brought from their homelands powerful cultural folkways, mores, and sensibilities. But the dominant culture throughout these early decades was the Anglo-Saxon one. As Edgar Allan Poe put it, ""the self-same Saxon current animates the British and the American heart."" Much later, the liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote that ""the language of the new nation, its laws, its institutions, it political ideas, its literature, its customs, its precepts, its prayers, primarily derived from Britain.""

In other words, beyond the American governmental creed, there were strong cultural affinities among the peoples of the new nation. That gave it cohesion and force. But Lepore ignores all this. She writes: ""When John Jay insisted, in the Federalist Papers, no. 2, 'that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people -- a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs,' he was whistling in the dark."" But he wasn't. Jay was describing a significant element of identity that pulled together the peoples of the United States at its birth, and a large part of it was a common ancestry.

Lepore also claims that Americans harbored little sense of a national destiny until the 1840s, in the wake of the European nationalism that swept the continent that decade. This is, to borrow a phrase from her, ""absurd on its face."" Is she saying that Benjamin Franklin, the great diplomatic genius of the Revolution and visionary promoter of a unified nation, had no sense of national destiny? Was not the Louisiana Purchase a product of Jefferson's vision of national destiny? What about Madison's success in getting the British out of the Great Lakes region after the War of 1812, clearing the way for an American expansion into that area? (The accelerated rise of Ohio was particularly instructive.) What about the 1919 Adams-Onis treaty, bringing Florida into the Union?

True, the sense of national destiny gelled with particular force in the 1840s, when the issue of Texas annexation exploded on the scene during John Tyler's presidency and James Polk subsequently drove to create a nation that stretched from ocean to ocean. And Lepore is correct in saying that the early states insisted on viewing themselves as sovereign entities within the American polity. But the sense of a national destiny was still a powerful force from the beginning. It couldn't be otherwise, as the states sent their senators and congressmen to Washington to craft legislation with immense national impact.

Why does Lepore feel a need to distort this picture? Could it be that she doesn't want to acknowledge that the country was built on a foundation far different from the country she wants portrayed in her ""new Americanism and...new American history""? Could it be that she doesn't want to acknowledge how the country has evolved over the decades, shedding some of its most unsavory elements (slavery in particular)?

The underlying flaw here is that Lepore sees an ongoing struggle in America between the heirs of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and W.E.B. Du Bois, on the one hand, and the heirs of John C. Calhoun, Stephen A. Douglas, and Father Coughlin, on the other. She presents a binary view of America and its history, with two forces -- good and evil -- at play. If liberal historians don't present the right version, she warns, other people will co-opt the narrative, embracing the racism of Calhoun and Douglas and Coughlin. To prevent that, she wants to obliterate the nation's cultural heritage.

In fact, though, the struggle of today is not John C. Calhoun versus Abraham Lincoln. It is about what the late Samuel Huntington of Harvard called the country's ""mainstream Anglo-Protestant culture in which most of its people, whatever their subcultures, have shared. For almost four centuries this culture of the founding settlers has been the central and the lasting component of American identity."" Huntington argued that, yes, race and ethnicity once represented foundational elements of the American identity. But they have fallen by the wayside. That has left the cultural and creedal identities.

Now the cultural element is under assault by intellectuals such as Jill Lepore, who want America's identity to be narrowed down to just its governing creed. That's why she must deny the country's early cultural cohesiveness born of the dominance of the continent's early British settlers. And that's why, in her essay, she equates those who wish to preserve that identity with the racism of a Calhoun or Coughlin.

America today is not about to revert back to the politics of John C. Calhoun. But it is in a struggle over whether the cultural core that Huntington identified can survive in a nation of mass immigration, porous borders, the bludgeon of political correctness, and an ongoing assault on a cultural heritage that once stirred inspiration throughout the land but now is being devoured by elite scholarship.

Lepore's piece is brilliantly clever but ultimately transparent. For all of her historical breadth and literary style, she presents just another assault on those ""deplorables"" who wish to preserve their country's cultural core.",194,The American Conservative,The Intellectual Assault On Our National Identity
"Jenny McCarthy slams ""The View"" in an upcoming book about the ABC News talk show. (Reuters, File)

Jenny McCarthy described her time co-hosting ""The View"" as ""miserable"" in an excerpt from a new book and slammed creator Barbara Walters, comparing her with the mother in the film ""Mommie Dearest.""

McCarthy -- a co-host on ""The View"" from 2013 to 2014 - opened up to author Ramin Setoodeh, who penned an upcoming book ""Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View."" An excerpt from the book was published by Vulture on Wednesday, and McCarthy doesn't sound like she enjoyed her experience very much.

'THE VIEW' HOST MEGHAN MCCAIN SAYS HER LATE FATHER WOULD LAUGH THAT TRUMP IS 'SO JEALOUS OF HIM'

""Every day I went home and I was miserable,"" McCarthy told Setoodeh. ""It really was the most miserable I've been on a job in my 25 years of show business.""

A spokesperson for ""The View"" declined comment when reached by Fox News.

""It really was the most miserable I've been on a job in my 25 years of show business.""

-- Jenny McCarthy

McCarthy compared Walters to the abusive mother in the 1981 film ""Mommie Dearest"" because of the way she spoke to her during a debate about her son's autism and whether or not it could be cured. That episode occurred when she was a guest on the program, prior to her landing the gig.

""I've never seen a woman yell like that before until I worked with Barbara Walters,"" she told Setoodeh. ""One of my heroes just chewed me a new a--hole.""

'THE VIEW' CO-HOST JOY BEHAR SAYS LINDSEY GRAHAM 'NEEDS TO FIND HIS TESTICULARITY'

McCarthy said she passed on a CBS talk show to join ""The View"" and was initially brought on the show ""because they wanted to get rid of politics,"" which were considered ""very polarizing"" at the time. Ironically, the show now focuses on politics and has regained relevancy with constant attacks on President Trump. But long before Trump entered the political landscape, ABC wanted McCarthy to focus on pop culture.

Once McCarthy officially joined the show, she says she was asked to pivot because Walters - who was in her final season - didn't know enough about pop culture to be part of the conversation.

""She was spacing out. She was checking out,"" McCarthy said of Walters. ""I panicked because I don't consider myself a political person... Now I had to figure out, 'Am I coming out as a Republican or a Democrat? Where do I stand on all the social issues and political issues?'""

McCarthy also told Setoodeh that Walters constantly nitpicked her clothing and fashion choices, often making her change to appease the show's creator.

""Barbara would check out what I was wearing. If she didn't agree with it, or it didn't complement her outfit, I had to change,"" McCarthy said. ""Mind you, she doesn't look at anyone's clothes but mine... I was a human Barbie doll.""

Another incident involved a used tampon floating in the co-hosts' restroom, and McCarthy claims Walters forced her to deal with it herself.

""She's standing in the hallway where the guests are, yelling at me about a tampon. I don't know. Maybe in her brain, she went, 'I'm going to the youngest, newest person here, because obviously she has her period and left a tampon floating.' This is Barbara Walters. I'm not going to yell at her. So finally I said, 'I'll take care of it. I'll take one for the team and I'll flush it,'"" McCarthy said.

While McCarthy clashed with Walters, she didn't exactly enjoy working with Whoopi Goldberg, either.

""People don't understand. Whoopi can knock over anyone in a debate. Her voice is not only strong in meaning but in sound. I was able to get a point out in three words -- like 'I don't agree' -- and that's all I would be able to say. I would be stepped on or interrupted,"" McCarthy said. ""She had an addiction to controlling all of it and everybody.""

"Perhaps the most remarkable and disquieting aspect of the revelation that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders is employing three senior advisers with records of involvement in anti-Semitic incidents is the disinterest it has engendered in Democratic circles across the board.

First, it emerged that Senator Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, and his senior foreign policy adviser, Matthew Duss, while both serving previously at the left-wing Center for American Progress (CAP) think tank, had in 2012 been involved in the use of antisemitic tropes about Jewish dual loyalty and domination of money and politics on CAP's blog and website.

Then it emerged that Sanders' national deputy press secretary, Bel√©n Sisa, had participated in a recent Facebook discussion in which she used the antisemitic trope of Jewish dual loyalty.

The anti-Semitic incidents involving Shakir and Duss created such a furore at the time that it led the Obama Administration -- an sdministration that was often deeply critical of, and in conflict with, Israel -- to criticize those involved and cease contacts with them.

Given that history, it is astonishing that a Democratic presidential candidate feels entirely at ease with having these three figures tainted with antisemitism within his inner circle of advisers.

The Sanders non-controversy is occurring in a wider context of Democratic Party drift towards the vociferously anti-Israel positions of the hard left, as well as the election to Congress in last year's midterms of proponents of these positions: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

These new legislators support anti-Israel campaigns, such as the Boycott, Sanctions & Divestment (BDS) movement -- a position that, until now, had enjoyed no support from a sitting member of Congress.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is critical of Jewish communities in the West Bank (Judea/Samaria) even though they comprise less than 2% of JudeaSamaria, and there has not been a single new community built since 1993. She also asserted her support for BDS and is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which opposes Israel's existence.

Rep. Omar, in a 2012 tweet reacting to Israeli military operations in Gaza that followed 150 rockets fired by terrorists into Israel, said, ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."" She staunchly defended her tweet before finally conceding its offensiveness, belatedly deleting it.

Since arriving in Congress, Omar has made further, false antisemitic statements, like asserting that supporters of Israel are urging American lawmakers to have ""allegiance to a foreign country,"" and tweeting that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) bribes legislators to support Israel.

Rep. Tlaib calls Israel a ""racist country"" on the basis of the lie that Israel discriminates against those ""darker skinned,"" ignoring the country's diversity and the fact that Israel has brought in huge numbers of black Ethiopians and dark-skinned Yemenites. She supports BDS and the destruction of Israel in favor of an Arab-dominated state (""It has to be one state""), absurdly claiming Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a consistent, outspoken supporter of Israel, as inspiration for her views. Rep. Tlaib also ""absolutely"" backs withholding U.S. aid from Israel.

When Tlaib was elected, she attended her primary victory party draped in the flag of the Palestinian Authority, and posed for a photo with Abbas Hamideh, a supporter of the terrorist Hezbollah group, after her official swearing-in ceremony.

What has been the reaction of senior Democrats?

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the second-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, initially declared that he didn't ""accept"" that Omar and Talib are anti-Semitic. House Democratic Caucus chair Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) described them merely as ""thoughtful colleagues."" Democratic presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), leapt to Omar's defense when Omar accused Israel's supporters of dual loyalty. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) legitimized Rep. Omar by elevating her to the House Foreign Relations Committee. (Pelosi subsequently criticized some of Omar's statements, but then absolved her of harboring deliberate antisemitic intent and refused to remove Omar from her committee assignments.)

House Democrats as a whole have performed little better. Initially, they prepared a resolution prompted by Omar's anti-Semitic statements. But many were less interested in condemning Omar's antisemitic outbursts than in producing a resolution condemning diverse forms of racism in the abstract. In the end, that is what the Democrat-controlled House passed, without even a mention of Omar.

Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said earlier this year that unless Republicans condemned Rep. Steve King (R-IA) and removed him from his committee assignments after he made racially insensitive remarks (which they did), the GOP would be guilty of ""tacit acceptance of racism.""

Yet Bass refused to subject Omar to the same equal standard, saying she ""absolutely would have a problem"" if the House resolution were to call Omar out specifically.",196,Breitbart,Morton Klein: Democratic Party Fails to Condemn Antisemitic Democrats | Breitbart
"As absurd as it seems, the anti-vaccination movement isn't just peddled in sketchy online forums and creepy Facebook groups; some politicians have also joined the fight, arguing that vaccinations for childhood diseases shouldn't be mandatory for anyone.

Recently, a Texas lawmaker (incorrectly and inexplicably) suggested that vaccines should be optional since antibiotics exist and now a conservative politician in Italy has joined the fight. Unfortunately, he brought chickenpox along with him since he had never been vaccinated, landing him in the hospital for several days.

Various news outlets in Italy have covered the plight of Massimiliano Fedriga, who has spent a portion of his political career fighting against mandatory vaccine laws.

Fedriga, who claims to be ""in favor"" of vaccines in practice but refuses to support legislation that would allow the preventative treatments to have the greatest impact, spent a total of four days in the hospital after coming down with the chickenpox.

Scientists and doctors have long promoted vaccines as a way of protecting public health since contagious diseases can be completely eradicated in a population if enough of the individuals have been vaccinated against them. That's exactly what happened in the United States decades ago, when the measles vaccine effectively eliminated the disease.

Now, with a growing number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children, the disease has made a huge comeback, forcing schools to take measures against unvaccinated students for the protection of the student body.

Like the measles vaccine, the chickenpox vaccine has been working fine for decades and it prevents the disease completely in over 95 percent of people who receive it.

Unfortunately, the safe and affordable treatment has become tangled in the anti-vaccination web and, as Fedriga just learned, contracting the disease as an adult is no fun at all.

In Fedriga's defense, the chickenpox vaccine was only made widely available in the mid-to-late 1980s. And at 35 years of age, it's likely Fedriga -- who says he received a full battery of available vaccinations as a child -- didn't even have the vaccine available to him as a youngster.

Nevertheless, it's a clear reminder that being unvaccinated can come back to bite you later in life, as diseases like chickenpox can be significantly more serious for adults than for children.

It's not likely that coming down with chickenpox as an adult will change Fedriga's position on mandatory vaccinations against common diseases, but that's the nature of politics.",197,New York Post,Politician against mandatory vaccinations hospitalized with chickenpox
"TEL AVIV -- David Kramer, a long-time advisor to late Senator John McCain, revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was being taken seriously.

In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander.

In a deposition on Dec. 13, 2017 that was recently posted online, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry's State Department.

""Senator McCain asked me to meet with both of them to see if this was being taken seriously in the government,"" Kramer said.

""And Senator McCain asked you to meet with them?"" Kramer was asked to clarify.

""Yes, just to see if this was being taken seriously. I think he wanted to do -- this was his kind of due diligence before he went to Director Comey.""

Kramer testified that in his conversations with Nuland and Wallander he was told by both of them that each were aware of the dossier and that Nuland ""thought Steele was a serious person.""

Kramer revealed that he gave a copy of the dossier to Wallander, who was familiar with the contents but did not have a copy.

""I had a subsequent conversation with Ms. Wallander in which I gave her a copy of the document. That was probably around New Year's,"" he said.

""She had not seen it herself until I had shown it to her,"" Kramer added. ""She had heard about it. And she didn't know the status of it.""

In the same testimony, the McCain associate revealed that he held a meeting about the dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer's permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated.

BuzzFeed infamously published Steele's full dossier on January 10, 2017 setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document.

Prior to his death, McCain admitted to personally handing the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey but he refused repeated requests for comment about whether he had a role in providing the dossier to BuzzFeed, including numerous inquiries sent to his office by this reporter.

In his book published last year, McCain maintained he had an ""obligation"" to pass the dossier charges against Trump to Comey and he would even do it again. ""Anyone who doesn't like it can go to hell,"" McCain exclaimed.

Kramer, meanwhile, also said that he briefed others reporters on the dossier contents, including CNN's Carl Bernstein, in an effort to have the anti-Trump charges verified.

The same day BuzzFeed released the full dossier, CNN first reported the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to then-President Obama and President-elect Trump.

Kramer said that he believed McCain was sought out in order to provide credibility to the dossier claims.

""I think they felt a senior Republican was better to be the recipient of this rather than a Democrat because if it were a Democrat, I think that the view was that it would have been dismissed as a political attack,"" Kramer stated.

The controversial Fusion GPS firm hired Steele to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the dossier. Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm.

Kramer's testimony sheds a new light on the role of the Obama administration in disseminating the largely-discredited dossier that was reportedly involved in the FBI's initial investigation into the Trump campaign and unsubstantiated claims of Russian collusion. Also Comey cited the dossier as evidence in a successful FISA application to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump's 2016 campaign. The testimony also revealed how McCain was utilized to give the wild dossier charges a credibility boost.

Nuland and dossier

Nuland's specific role in the dossier episode has been the subject of some controversy for her.

In their book, ""Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump,"" authors and reporters by Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier's claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates.

Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia.

Regarding the arrangements for Steele's initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report:

There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland's office at the State Department : Do you support this meeting ? Nuland, having found Steele's reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light.

Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele's office near Victoria station . Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read . He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing . Then he remarked, ""I have to report this to headquarters.""

The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele's reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele's general work.

Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Clinton's State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi.

Nuland's name surfaced in a flurry of news media reports last year about the dossier and Kerry's State Department.

Sidney Blumenthal

An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named another former official from Kerry's State Department for alleged involvement in circulating the dossier. The magazine reported that Kerry's chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, obtained the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually decided to share the questionable document with Kerry.

Finer received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland.

After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele.

Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an ""old friend."" Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal - which Winer in turn gave to Steele - originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals.

Nuland, Winer Give Conflicting Accounts

There are seeming discrepancies between Winer and Nuland about actions taken involving the dossier.

Nuland described in a Politico podcast interview what she claimed was her reaction when she was presented with Steele's dossier information at the State Department.

She said that she offered advice to ""those who were interfacing with"" Steele, immediately telling the intermediary or intermediaries that Steele ""should get this information to the FBI."" She further explained that a career employee at the State Department could not get involved with the dossier charges since such actions could violate the Hatch Act, which prevents employees in the executive branch of the federal government from engaging in certain kinds of political activities.

In a second interview, this one with CBS's Face The Nation, Nuland also stated that her ""immediate"" reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI.

Here is a transcript of the relevant section of her February 5 interview with Susan B. Glasser, who described Nuland as ""my friend"" and referred to her by her nickname ""Toria"":

Glasser: When did you first hear about his dossier?

Nuland: I first heard -- and I didn't know who his client was until much later, until 2017, I think, when it came out. I first heard that he had done work for a client asserting these linkages -- I think it was late July, something like that.

Glasser: That's very interesting. And you would have taken him seriously just because you knew that he knew what he was talking about on Russia?

Nuland: What I did was say that this is about U.S. politics, and not the work of -- not the business of the State Department, and certainly not the business of a career employee who is subject to the Hatch Act, which requires that you stay out of politics. So, my advice to those who were interfacing with him was that he should get this information to the FBI, and that they could evaluate whether they thought it was credible.

Glasser: Did you ever talk about it with anyone else higher up at the department? With Secretary Kerry or anybody else?

Nuland: Secretary Kerry was also aware. I think he's on the record and he had the same advice.

Nuland stated that Kerry ""was also aware"" of the dossier, but she did not describe how he was made aware. She made clear that she told ""those who were interfacing"" with Steele to go to the FBI since any State Department involvement could violate the Hatch Act.

Her Politico podcast interview was not the only time she claimed that her reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI.

On Face The Nation on February 4, Nuland engaged in the following exchange in which she stated her ""immediate"" reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI (emphasis added):

MARGARET BRENNAN: The dossier.

VICTORIA NULAND: The dossier, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding, and our immediate reaction to that was, ""This is not in our purview. This needs to go to the FBI, if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian federation. That's something for the FBI to investigate.""

And that was our reaction when we saw this. It's not our -- we can't evaluate this. And frankly, if every member of the campaign who the Russians tried to approach and tried to influence had gone to the FBI as well in real time, we might not be in the mess we're in today.

Nuland gave the two interviews after her name started surfacing in news media reports involving Kerry's State Department and the dossier. Her name also came up in relation to a criminal referral of Steele to the Justice Department in the form of a letter authored last year by Sen. Chuck Grassley, who at the time chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).

The Grassley-Graham criminal referral contains redacted information that Steele received information from someone in the State Department, who in turn had been in contact with a ""foreign sub-source"" who was in touch with a redacted name described as a ""friend of the Clintons.""

Numerous media reports have since stated that the source of information provided to the State Department that was in turn passed on to Steele was Cody Shearer, a controversial figure tied to the Clintons who is also an associate of longtime Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal. According to sources who spoke to CNN, Shearer's information was passed from Blumenthal to Winer, who at the time was a special State Department envoy for Libya working under Kerry. Winer says that Kerry personally recruited him to work at the State Department.

It is Winer's version of events that seems to conflict with Nuland's.

In an oped published in the Washington Post, Winer identified Nuland as the State Department official with whom he shared Steele's information. Winer writes that Nuland's reaction was that ""she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material."" He does not relate any further reaction from Nuland.

Winer wrote in the Washington Post (emphasis added):

In the summer of 2016, Steele told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials. He did not provide details but made clear the information involved ""active measures,"" a Soviet intelligence term for propaganda and related activities to influence events in other countries.

In September 2016, Steele and I met in Washington and discussed the information now known as the ""dossier."" Steele's sources suggested that the Kremlin not only had been behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign but also had compromised Trump and developed ties with his associates and campaign.

I was allowed to review, but not to keep, a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department. I prepared a two-page summary and shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.

That was the extent of Winer's description of Nuland's reaction upon being presented with Steele's dossier claims. Nuland's public claim that her ""immediate"" response was to refer Steele to the FBI since State involvement could violate the Hatch Act seems to conflict with the only reaction that Winer relates from Nuland - that she felt Kerry should be made aware of the dossier information.

In Winer's Washington Post oped, he writes that Steele had a larger relationship with the State Department, passing over 100 reports relating to Russia to the U.S. government agency through Winer. Winer wrote that Nuland found Steele's reports to be ""useful"" and asked Winer to ""continue to send them.""

He wrote:

In 2013, I returned to the State Department at the request of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, whom I had previously served as Senate counsel. Over the years, Steele and I had discussed many matters relating to Russia. He asked me whether the State Department would like copies of new information as he developed it. I contacted Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who was then assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and shared with her several of Steele's reports. She told me they were useful and asked me to continue to send them. Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele's reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful. None of the reports related to U.S. politics or domestic U.S. matters, and the reports constituted a very small portion of the data set reviewed by State Department experts trying to make sense of events in Russia.

Kramer and the dossier

In his book, ""The Restless Wave,"" McCain provided an inside account of how he says he came across the dossier.

He wrote that he was told about the claims in the document at a security conference in Canada in November 2016, where he was approached by Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier.

McCain wrote that Wood told him Steele ""had been commissioned to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian agents as well as potentially compromising information about the President-elect that Putin allegedly possessed.""

McCain, however, did not address the obvious question of whether he was told exactly who ""commissioned"" Steele to ""investigate"" the alleged Russian ties. The dossier was paid for by Clinton's campaign and the DNC.

McCain goes on to describe Wood as telling him Steele's work ""was mostly raw, unverified intelligence, but that the author strongly believed merited a thorough examination by counterintelligence experts.""

The politician says the dossier claims described to him were ""too strange a scenario to believe, something out of a le Carr√© novel, not the kind of thing anyone has ever actually had to worry about with a new President, no matter what other concerns.""

Still, McCain says he reasoned that ""even a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated.""

McCain concedes Wood told him he had not actually read the dossier himself, and writes that he wasn't sure if he ever met Wood before and couldn't recall previously having a conversation with Wood. Still, McCain took Wood's word for it when Wood vouched for Steele's credibility. ""Steele was a respected professional, Wood assured us, who had good Russian contacts and long experience collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Kremlin,"" McCain wrote.

Present at the meeting with Wood and McCain was Kramer, who McCain writes agreed to ""go to London to meet Steele, confirm his credibility and report back to me.""

McCain doesn't detail Kramer's visit to London beyond simply writing, ""When David returned, and shared his impression that the former spy was, as Sir Andrew had vouched, a respected professional, and not to outward appearances given to hyperbole or hysteria, I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as 'the dossier.'''

McCain leaves out exactly where Kramer obtained his dossier copy.

The Washington Post reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. Those details marked the clearest indication that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI.

Also, in a New York Times oped in January, GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed ""emissary.""

In his own testimony, Kramer relates conversations with Simpson about the dossier.

"In recent days, Democrats have been trampling all over each other to get to a microphone to trumpet massive structural changes to American public life.

First, several presidential candidates are calling for an increase in the size of the Supreme Court. Nine justices are too few, apparently. In a proposal that seems straight out of the writers' room at ""The West Wing,"" Beto O'Rourke wants the court apportioned by party, with 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans, and an extra five chosen by the 10 partisan ones.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has endorsed a proposal to lower the federal voting age to 16 (an idea already being contemplated at the local level in Oregon and the District of Columbia, and gathering steam in California).

Oh, and a great many Democrats want to abolish the Electoral College. This is nothing new for modern Democrats, who feel the electoral college makes it too hard for them to win the presidency. But there's never been serious practical discussion of it because it's pointless to advocate it -- 38 states would have to vote to agree to it for the amendment to pass, and as such a move would weaken the political power of small states, that will never happen.

Welcome to the Democratic presidential campaign of 2020. You can expect at least five minutes of every presidential debate to be taken up by that fantasy as well as these others.

Why are leading figures in the Democratic party tossing around radical and wildly unrealistic proposals the way Tom Cruise mixed drinks in ""Cocktail"" as they prepare to wage a national battle for the presidency they have reason to believe they can win?

The most obvious answer is that Democrats want to change the rules because they think the rules aren't working for them. They want the popular vote instead of the electoral college because they've won the popular vote four times out of the past five elections. They want to pack the court because the court is going conservative. And they want the voting age lowered to 16 because they want to stuff the ballot box.

So they have good reason to want what they want. But what they want will require a wholesale revision of our political system. Is it wise for them to be shouting about this from the rooftops?

Democrats did not win a wave midterm election with an astounding 62 million votes nationwide because they said they were going to revolutionize American politics. When it came to policy, they largely focused on health care.

And when it came to general national matters, they were subdued enough to allow voters to use them as proxies to express their discomfort with the cultural revolutionary in the White House. Had they been excessively provocative, 40 seats wouldn't have switched from Republican hands to Democratic hands.

There are several answers. First and most important is that while 2018 voters might not have craved radicalism from their candidates, the people running for president in 2020 seem pretty convinced Democratic primary voters are hungry for it.

Thus, there's no downside to making visionary speeches advocating transformational change -- especially if the transformational changes are designed to give Democrats and liberals structural control of the political institutions the current system has not allowed them to dominate entirely.

If Democrats running for president are sure that their party's primary voters have been thoroughly radicalized by Trump, then it stands to reason those voters aren't going to judge them harshly for not being prudent and realistic about what they think or what they might promise. Such people do not want to hear about what is prudent and what is achievable. They want to hear ""La Marseillaise.""

In the case of Nancy Pelosi and lowering the voting age, something more cynical may be going on. Pelosi said last week she didn't think trying to impeach President Trump was worth it. Since she was taking that piece of raw meat away from her party's starving mob, she had to throw them another one.

Here's the thing, though. Eighty thousand votes won Donald Trump the election in 2016 -- votes scattered across three states that Barack Obama had won twice.

If you put aside all the high-flown talk about the grand meaning of the Trump victory and what it tells us about America and our history and white supremacy and blah blah blah, the challenge for Democrats in 2020 is pretty simple. They need to get 80,000 new Democratic votes in those places, flip the states, and reclaim the presidency.

They won in 2018 by not being lunatics. Democrats seem intent on testing the proposition that it will take a lunatic to beat a Tweeter.",199,New York Post,"Sore over their loss to Trump, Democrats now want to change the rules"
"""I'm a white Australian,"" writes Rachel Withers for Slate. ""I know that blaming myself and my cohort is illogical, but I can't escape the feeling that all of white Australia is implicated in the deaths -- a white majority that has fomented and let foment hate.""

Ms. Withers asserts that the responsibility for the lethal attacks does not lie with the shooter alone, nor even with ""those who have stoked the international spread of white-supremacist ideology"" such as Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Donald Trump Jr.

""Brenton Tarrant was an Aussie through and through, growing up in a country town north of Sydney, steeped in mainstream Australian racism and our particular national brand of Islamophobia,"" Withers laments.

""I grew up steeped in the same environment, just two years younger than Tarrant, and when I was a child the omnipresent racism seemed, well, normal to me,"" she adds.

And Tarrant did not carry out the attacks just in his own name, Withers insists, but ""in the name of white Australia.""

White Australians now ""face an overdue and now unavoidable reckoning with the role our anti-immigrant politics and culture played in shaping and normalizing Tarrant's brand of hate,"" she said predictably.

Ms. Withers then proceeds to assert that racism is embedded in the very roots of Australia in what comes across as a painful exercise in hatred of one's homeland.

""A white-majority Australia exists only as the result of a genocidal invasion -- another irony missed by Tarrant (and Trump) in his rants about invasion,"" she declares, calling it Australia's ""original sin.""

The concrete means that Withers proposes to eradicate Australia's hate was to be expected: curb free speech and expel those who do not support unrestrained immigration.

""We must condemn hate speech,"" she said, ""... and we must deny visas to alt-right figures who come to our shores expecting a friendly welcome not just in the wake of right-wing terror attacks, but always.""

""You might think that this is all too strong, that placing at least some of the blame on white Australia is a kind of self-centered masochism, that blaming a nation's culture for the sins of a citizen is like blaming humanity for the crimes of one man,"" Withers concedes, before saying that it must be done anyway since there is no other option.

What Ms. Withers may not be considering in her self-righteous screed is that embracing collective guilt by association opens the door to the very sins she seems to detest the most.

If all ""white Australians"" are guilty for the crimes of one white Australian, then why aren't all Muslims responsible for the crimes of Islamic State terrorists? Why aren't all Jews responsible for the death of Jesus Christ? Why aren't all blacks responsible for the atrocities of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin? Why aren't all leftists responsible for the crimes of Nicol√°s Maduro or Harvey Weinstein? The list could go on forever.

And if you can pick and choose just when such collective guilt will be assigned, on what grounds will the choice be made? Who will be the final arbiter to impute guilt or absolve from it?

All in all, the article reads like a high schooler's ill-informed and petulant rant, long on impassioned feelings and short on reason.

"Speaking at the White House, John Bolton struck a similar tone to both the President himself and U.S. Ambassador to London Woody Johnson, who have all emphasised the enormous potential for trade between the United Kingdom and the United States after Britain leaves the protectionist European Union bloc.

Bolton said greatly improved trade awaited if the UK was able to resolve the Brexit situation, remarking: ""...the president has been clear he wants a resolution to this issue that allows the United States and Britain to come to trade deals again. He sees huge opportunity if Britain's status can be resolved.""

Emphasising that the U.S. was waiting for the UK to leave the EU, he said: ""We are ready to go. Trade minister Liam Fox would be welcome here, any member of the government would be welcome here. We can do these deals quickly. We are ready to go... We want to partner with a newly independent Britain.""

While many of Bolton's comments were on trade, he also noted with apparent regret the state of British politics. While emphasising that he wasn't a British citizen and would likely have a lot more to say on the matter if he were, President Trump's close advisor said: ""...and I think the point [President Trump] has made that I would stress is, [the] people of Britain have voted. Where is the political class going to give effect to that vote?""

In making his remarks, Bolton became the second senior figure close to the President to speak to the UK media about Brexit and the failure of British democracy in hours, leading to speculation by the anti-Brexit British mainstream media to speculate their remarks had been part of an ""apparent coordinated intervention"".

Bolton's comments followed others by the President's son, Donald Trump Jr, who expressed serious concern about the health of British democracy, which has proven itself unable to deliver the wish of the British people expressed through a simple yes-no binary referendum in 2016. It has now been 1,000 days since the historic vote, and Mr Trump said of the failure: ""the people of both the UK and the US must reaffirm the decisions they made in 2016 to stand up for themselves against the global elite.""",201,Breitbart,Trump Advisor Bolton: 'When Will Political Class Deliver Brexit?'

Democrats running for president in 2020 have argued that the electoral college should be abolished after key midwest states supported Trump for president, allowing him to beat Hillary Clinton, despite Clinton winning the popular vote.

""The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win,"" Trump wrote after he campaigned heavily in traditionally Democrat states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania in 2016.

Trump said his campaign would be different if he was running for president to win the popular vote, admitting that he used to like the idea of winning by a popular vote.

""Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier and different than campaigning for the Electoral College,"" he wrote. ""It's like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon.""

Trump mocked Democrats for their ""strange"" proposals to change the rules of elections and politics so that it was easier to win.

DAVID BOSSIE: PELOSI WILL LEAD TRUMP IMPEACHMENT FIGHT - DON'T BELIEVE HER DENIALS

As campaigning for next year's Democratic presidential primaries gets underway, it is simply jaw-dropping to contrast the no-nonsense style of President Trump and his hugely successful pro-growth capitalist agenda with the miserably weak field of socialist Democrat White House wannabees.

What a pitiful sight to see a party so mired in political correctness that candidates for the presidential nomination can't say what they really think because they may offend the aristocracy of coastal elites calling the shots.

Former Rep. and defeated Senate candidate Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke, D-Texas, feels the need to apologize for being a white male and for making a lighthearted joke about his wife raising the couple's kids. This was about as pathetic as it gets.

In one week, O'Rourke's proven that he's got no guts and he's succeeded in making sure everyone knows it.

As a presidential candidate, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has gained notoriety for her talent of being able to say absolutely anything in order to get votes from unhinged leftists.

Over the summer, Gillibrand called for the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Most recently, as part of her pander campaign to the open-borders crowd, Gillibrand irresponsibly said that ""immigration is not a security issue.""

The junior senator from New York made this juvenile statement despite recent testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that illegal immigration just surged 30 percent in one month, ""with agents apprehending or encountering nearly 75,000 aliens"" in February alone.

It takes a special kind of person to misrepresent the crisis at our border in such dramatic terms. The vast majority of Americans see human trafficking, the opioid crisis, and MS-13 gang violence as an emergency that must be solved.

The incredible shrinking candidate Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been reduced to saying whatever she can to distract voters from her false claims of Native American ancestry to advance her career. Monday night - at yet another low-ratings CNN town hall broadcast - Warren said she wants to abolish the Electoral College as our system for electing the president of the United States.

Unsurprisingly, Warren wants the leftist bastions of California and New York to be able to decide presidential elections because almost no one outside San Francisco and Manhattan thinks socialism can succeed.

Then there's former Vice President Joe Biden, who appears poised to make his third failed run for president in the past 30 years. Everyone who's followed politics since 1987 knows that Biden has been a complete non-starter on the national stage when trying to stand on his own.

Biden knows full well that he exists as a national entity only because Barack Obama chose him to be his running mate in 2008. Old Joe is a man in denial, but will likely take the plunge into the race anyway. What else is a Washington swamp creature supposed to do?

Once he enters the race, Biden will undoubtedly be met with questions over allegations of crony capitalism and corruption during his time as Obama's vice president.

In the unlikely event Biden pulls a surprise and decides not to run, comrade socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont would catapult to the top of the sputtering Democratic field.

An average of recent polls shows Biden and Sanders running one-two, taking 30 percent and 22 percent of the primary vote respectively. What does it say about the current state of the Democratic Party that a retread like Joe Biden and the very far-left Bernie Sanders - who called breadlines a ""good thing"" in the 1980s - are their frontrunners for the nomination?

With a party this adrift, horrible ideas are actually gaining attention among Democrats. These include Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., pledging to get rid of the private health insurance for 175 million Americans and an unknown candidate promising to give every American adult $1,000 a month for doing nothing.

The reality is that the Trump economy is on fire and the Democratic field of candidates can't explain this reality away. In fact, recent polling shows that 71 percent of the American people believe that the economy is in ""good shape."" Even The Washington Post felt compelled to publish an analysis headlined ""How Democrats are putting a bad spin on good economic news.""

The bottom line is that Reagan and Trump's policies prove that capitalism lifts nations up - and the Soviet Union and Venezuela prove that socialism destroys nations.

"President Trump turned up the heat Wednesday in his feud with George Conway, calling the spouse of adviser Kellyanne Conway a ""stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!""

""George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife's success & angry that I, with her help, didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.

In one of the more bizarre feuds of the Trump era, George Conway has repeatedly questioned the president's mental health on social media, all while his wife continues to work at the White House.

He fired back within seconds Wednesday, tweeting: ""You seem determined to prove my point. Good for you! #NarcissisticPersonalityDisorder.""

He added: ""You. Are. Nuts.""

Conway revived their dispute last week by blasting Trump for a claim that the sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had exonerated the president from the Russian collusion piece of the probe.

""Have we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life?"" Conway tweeted. ""One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off. But instead he lies about it. He denies what the world can see on videotape. Even his donors and supporters wonder, what is wrong with him? Why would he feel compelled to tell such an absurd lie?""

Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale initially responded by claiming he was just sour grapes.

""We all know that @realDonaldTrump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked @TheJusticeDept and was either fired/quit, didn't want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn't even know him!"" Parscale tweeted.

Later, Trump retweeted Parscale, adding: ""A total loser!"" in reference to Conway.

GEORGE CONWAY RAMPS UP TRUMP ATTACKS AS KELLYANNE DEFENDS BOSS

The Trump White House until now had kept its distance from Conway's criticisms, rarely firing back, due to Kellyanne's prominent role in both Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the White House.

But in December, the president's son, Eric, slammed Conway as disrespectful toward his wife.

""Of all the ugliness in politics, the utter disrespect George Conway shows toward his wife, her career, place of work, and everything she has fought SO hard to achieve, might top them all,"" Eric Trump tweeted late last year. ""@KellyannePolls is a great person and frankly his actions are horrible.""

Meanwhile, Kellyanne, in December, reportedly described her husband's comments as ""disrespectful"" to The Washington Post, and ""a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows.""

She then attempted to attribute the quote to ""a person familiar with their relationship"" -- a request that was denied by Post writer Ben Terris.

The Electoral College was devised by the framers, Alexander Hamilton actually, to spread the power to elect the president among all the states. It was meant to prevent states with just the largest populations from choosing the President, cycle after cycle.

And by the same reasoning, it's why we created the Senate, too -- two senators from each state, regardless of population. So do the Democrats like to disband the Senate as well? Well, in this climate, who knows? Maybe, they'll float that idea during the primary season. That'll be fun.

But this new radicalized field believes that you can treat the Constitution kind of like my kids handle projects on Google docs. You just change it when it suits you in the moment.

But these radicalization games don't end at the court. They're also racing to buy off the black vote with the promise of reparations. No need to grapple with practical questions about this proposal, like how you determine who receives and who pays for the reparations, how much it would cost, whether Nigerians who just arrived here would get them or whether new immigrants from places like Serbia have to chip in.

Still, competing in the radicalization games is a heck of a lot easier than trying to convince voters that Democrats will put more money in your pocket, with a faster growing economy and that they're going to take on China in a better way than Trump. How would Kamala or Bernie or Elizabeth do that?

For all their scary talk of Donald Trump destroying our institutions, these fanatics, if given a chance, are perfectly willing to burn them all down for political advantage.

Democrats were once the party of ideas, the party of the little guy. Well, the little guy is actually doing much better under Trump, and they know it. So what's their answer? To replace you, slowly but surely, with new voters. To replace the old system that elected Donald Trump with a new system that they'll say is fairer.

The Democrats' plan is pretty cynical - to convince hardworking immigrants that they need an ever-growing government in order to thrive and survive. The 2020 radicals believe these new voters will be more pliable and more amenable than the traditional American voter who still believes in the rule of law, public safety, and borders.

Now understand this. The new radicals competing today believe enforcing immigration law is the new evil - it's racist. Ditto for the entire electoral college and actually the Founding Fathers themselves -- they were racist, too. So why would anyone be bound today, they think, by a bunch of old dead white guys and what they wrote 250 years ago?

The radicalization Olympics is going to be a lot of fun to watch as the candidates elbow each other out of the way and contort themselves into positions they rejected just a few years ago in order to placate the new mob today. But for all their scary talk of Donald Trump destroying our institutions, these fanatics, if given a chance, are perfectly willing to burn them all down for political advantage.

And are there really that many Americans who want to go all-in for European-style socialism here in the good old U.S. of A?

"The president is right that our military badly needs more funding, but the way in which he proposes to accomplish that goal leaves much to be desired.

As the details of the Trump administration's budget request trickle out in the coming weeks, President Trump is likely to tout it as a fulfillment of his promise to rebuild the military. And, on the surface, it's easy to see why. The $750 billion top-line military-spending request represents the real 3 to 5 percent growth most defense experts believe is necessary to recover from the damaging effects of sequestration and meet the challenges outlined in the National Defense Strategy.

But as much as the administration's top-line defense number matters, it's also important to look beneath the surface at how it proposes to spend all that money. And viewed that way, the budget's flaws become much more apparent.

The administration's request relies on a number of work-arounds to reach the $750 billion that will allow President Trump and Pentagon leaders to make good on their commitment to rebuilding the military. The most obvious and egregious is an inflated budget for Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, which is intended to fund warfighting needs. The president's budget includes $174 billion for OCO, including $9 billion to cover shortfalls in military-construction funding created when President Trump declared a national emergency to fund the border wall.

The president's request for the Fiscal Year 2020 base national-defense budget (essentially regular funding for the Pentagon and a few other agencies) is $576 billion. This request adheres to the sequestration cap imposed by the Budget Control Act, or BCA, which nearly every defense leader on both sides of the aisle agrees is far too low to ensure our national security.

Here's why all of this budget math matters.

First, the president's reliance on OCO misreads the politics of the budget process. Since the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, the administration's budget request is essentially a messaging document -- and the message this budget sends is not strong enough. Simply put, the president cannot claim to support rebuilding the military and submit a budget request that complies with the BCA sequestration caps. For all the grief Republicans gave the last administration over inadequate defense spending, even President Obama never submitted a budget request at sequestration levels.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree that they will have to come to a bipartisan compromise that raises the BCA sequestration caps on both defense and non-defense discretionary spending. This is especially true now that Democrats have the House majority. In those negotiations, strong leadership from the White House is critical to providing a solid starting point for negotiations, and this budget doesn't cut it. Pretending to adhere to sequestration while stuffing $174 billion into the BCA-exempt OCO account harms Republicans' negotiating position and only ensures that the president's budget request will be dead on arrival on Capitol Hill.

That leads to the second way in which the president's defense-budget request misses the mark: procedurally. While the OCO account has an important budgeting function, it has become a convenient but irresponsible way to skirt the constraints of the BCA sequestration caps for defense. Everyone from anti-war liberal Democrats to conservative Republican fiscal hawks has decried the reliance on OCO in the era of sequestration. And the administration's FY2020 budget more than doubles the OCO request from recent years. The administration itself even admits that a full 60 percent of its OCO request -- almost $100 billion -- is actually for base Pentagon spending.

The problem is not just that OCO is widely regarded as having become a budget gimmick and an emblem of fiscal irresponsibility. Inflating the OCO account has real-world implications for our military: It limits flexibility and planning -- two priorities that are integral to the way the Pentagon operates. What our military needs are adequate, stable, and sustainable resources -- and that cannot be achieved by pumping up the OCO budget.

Finally, the president's defense-budget request sends the wrong message on policy. The right way to do defense budgeting is to first assess the threats to our national security and then determine what is needed to meet those threats. To the administration's credit, it started that process with the National Defense Strategy, or NDS, released last year. But this budget request does not line up with the policy priorities outlined in that document.

The NDS makes a clear prioritization of the threats we face. ""Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,"" it says. The Pentagon's top priority is now preparing for competition with China and Russia -- not focusing on the Middle East. President Trump has been an advocate for this approach and gone much further, railing against ""endless wars"" in the Middle East and calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and potentially Afghanistan. Yet his budget request uses what is essentially a Middle East warfighting account (OCO used to be called the ""Global War on Terrorism"" account) to shelter nearly $100 billion of base defense spending. That just doesn't square with the administration's stated policy priorities.

If the administration actually believed that $174 billion belonged in the OCO account -- if the president believed preparing for strategic competition with China and Russia was so important that it deserved wartime, emergency funding -- it would be wise to say so and make an affirmative case for its position. But that is not how this budget is being presented. Rather, the OCO gimmick is being presented as no more or less than what it is. This was not a decision based on defense strategy; it seems more the work of the Office of Management and Budget than the National Security Council.

Yet these realities remain: Strategic competition is our top national-security concern, and China is our pacing threat. Last week, it was announced that China plans to increase its defense spending by 7.5 percent this year as part of a long military buildup. In the face of rising threats from strategic competitors, the United States must invest in reorienting our military and developing new capabilities. We would like to offer unequivocal support for the administration's effort to boost the U.S. defense budget by the required 3 to 5 percent to help further that important goal -- but the increase has to happen in the right way. Let's hope Congress, which will dispose of the president's budget request, does better.",207,nationalreview.com,Why Trump's Defense Budget Is Flawed
"Senator Elizabeth Warren has joined a growing chorus within the Democratic party in calling for the abolition of the Electoral College. Speaking at a forum in Mississippi on Monday night, Warren said that she hoped to ensure that ""every vote matters"" and proposed that ""the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.""

Warren's lofty rhetoric notwithstanding, a large portion of the Democratic party's present animosity toward the Electoral College is rooted in rank partisanship. Since they watched their supposed ""blue wall"" evaporate in the small hours of the 2016 presidential election, many Democrats have felt sufficient anger with the system to seek to remake it. This habit has by no means been limited to the Electoral College. Indeed, no sooner has the Democratic party lost control of an institution that it had assumed it would retain in perpetuity than that institution has been denounced as retrograde and unfair. In the past year alone, this impulse has led to calls for the abolition or reinvention of the Senate, the Supreme Court, and more.

Insofar as there does exist a serious argument against the Electoral College, it is increasingly indistinguishable from the broader argument against the role that the states play within the American constitutional order, and thus from the argument against federalism itself. President Reagan liked to remind Americans that, far from serving as regional administrative areas of the nation-state, the states are the essential building blocks of America's political, legal, and civic life.

In our era of viciously divisive politics, the states are arguably more necessary than they have ever been. Critics of the Electoral College bristle at the insistence that it prevents New York and California from imposing their will on the rest of the country. But the Electoral College guarantees that candidates who seek the only nationally elected office in America must attempt to appeal to as broad a geographic constituency as possible -- large states and small, populous and rural -- rather than retreating to their preferred pockets and running up the score. The alternative to this arrangement is not less political contention or a reduction in anger; it is more of both.

In addition to protecting the political diversity for which the United States is famous, the Electoral College brings with it a number of practical advantages that are crucial to good government. Under the current system, the result of presidential elections tends to be clear almost immediately -- there is no need, for example, to wait three weeks for California to process its ballots; it is nigh-on impossible for voters to return a tie or disputed outcome; and, because presidential elections are, in effect, fifty-one separate elections, accusations of voting fraud and abuse hold less purchase than they would if all franchisees were melted into a single, homogenous blob. The freak occurrence that was Bush v. Gore is often raised as an objection against the status quo. Less attention is paid to the obvious question: What if that recount had been national?

Impressively, Elizabeth Warren's plan for straight abolition is not the worst reform being touted at the moment. Impatient at the lack of progress that the #Resistance has made in pulling the wiring out of America's constitutional engine, a handful of states have adopted the ""National Popular Vote"" plan, which binds their electors to cast their ballots for the candidate who wins a majority of votes nationwide. Until enough states have signed on to tip the balance past 270 -- and, indeed, until the inevitable litigation has been concluded -- adoption of the NPV will remain purely symbolic. Should it be put into action, however, it would achieve the remarkable feat of removing all of the benefits that the Electoral College provides while preventing the electors of each state from voting for the presidential candidate whom a majority in that state had picked. Who knew that the outsourcing craze would extend to democracy?

The U.S. Constitution is a complex document that, as Whitman might have put it, contains multitudes. At once, it boasts guarantees of democracy and protections against it; hosts an outline for national action, and a blueprint for localism; and serves as a vehicle for the majority, while including guarantees that the most significant decisions must be broadly agreed upon. The Electoral College is one of the many finely tuned institutions within the charter that have ensured stability and continuity in America for more than two centuries. To destroy it in a hail of platitudes, civic ignorance, and old-fashioned political pique would be a disastrous mistake.",208,nationalreview.com,In Defense of the Electoral College | National Review

Beto O'Rourke's presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president. At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn't accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run. But at least he won. O'Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.

MARC THIESSEN: IT'S PELOSI VS. OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB IN THE BATTLE TO CONTROL THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O'Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he ""brought a great deal of vitality"" to his work ""preserving our planet and protecting our people."" (In fact, O'Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, ""What would you say is Beto O'Rourke's top accomplishment that he brings to the table?"" Hinojosa could not name a single one. ""I'm not even talking about Congress,"" Henry said. ""What has he done in his life?"" ""Your question is meaningless,"" Hinojosa replied.

So, if O'Rourke hasn't accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right? Nope. The Post reports that ""unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O'Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country's toxic politics."" The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair's Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O'Rourke ""can't deny the pull of his own gifts."" He tells a reporter, ""Man, I'm just born to be in it.""

He's not the only statewide loser taking the national stage. Stacey Abrams lost the governor's race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union -- a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well. ""I think that I am a skilled communicator,"" she said. ""I think I'm a very good thinker. No, I know I'm a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience.""

Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as ""former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations"" (a temporary membership for young people) as well as ""a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations."" That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O'Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.

Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president. That's true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O'Rourke, he had actual accomplishments -- including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.

This is not to dismiss O'Rourke's chances. He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders's first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, ""In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007.""

"Howard Kurtz: 2020 contenders make partisan push in guise of process reforms

Elizabeth Warren wants to get rid of the Electoral College.

She is billing this as a step toward reform.

""Every vote matters,"" the U.S. senator from Massachusetts told CNN, ""and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.""

She argued that presidential nominees no longer campaign in places like California and Massachusetts because they're not swing states, instead focusing on battlegrounds that are up for grabs.

That's true, but if you abolished the college tomorrow, candidates would camp out in such megastates as New York, California, Florida, and Texas in an effort to run up their popular vote totals. The college forces them to move around the country, especially to smaller states whose handful of electoral votes could tip the balance.

I have mixed feelings about the Electoral College, which has been debated seemingly forever. It does seem like a relic of the 18th century. It has a musty, anti-democratic smell around it.

But the old rules help the winner by exaggerating their margin of victory. And it avoids the nightmare of a national recount in a contested election, a calamity that would make people nostalgic for Florida's hanging chads.

DEMOCRATS' CALLS TO REVAMP ELECTORAL COLLEGE, SUPREME COURT REVEAL PANIC: LARA TRUMP

Still, Warren's newfound passion for dumping the Electoral College is driven by Democratic primary politics. Without that part of the Constitution, Al Gore would have won the presidency in 2000 and Hillary Clinton would have been victorious in 2016.

Democrats feel the college is keeping them from having a lock on the White House, so it's a new kind of red meat. Why else would a candidate like Warren get excited over a constitutional amendment that would take years to pass?

Colorado just became the 12th state to sign a compact giving its electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, even if that candidate loses Colorado. The deal would take effect once states with 270 electoral votes sign on, but right now it's at 181.

OPINION: IN DEFENSE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE -- THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INTERSTATE COMPACT IS A BIG MISTAKE

Meanwhile, Warren has been joined by Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand in pushing to expand the Supreme Court. The three 2020 contenders told Politico they support the idea, which Warren said would be about ""depoliticizing"" the high court.

But their motivation isn't hard to divine. First, Democrats openly complain, with much justification, that they were unfairly denied a Senate vote on Merrick Garland's nomination in 2016.

Second, President Trump has already named 91 federal judges, with the prospect of many more to come.

2020 DEMOCRATS EYE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: 'ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE'

But this is all too reminiscent of FDR's court-packing scheme, which was a political failure. Some Democrats want 15 justices on the court. They obviously see this as a way to correct the fact that the court now has a clear conservative majority -- a point that Trump addressed yesterday at a news conference in predicting it would never happen.

""The only reason they're doing that is they're trying to catch up,"" Trump said. ""So if they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election they want to try doing it in a different way.""

To have even a prayer of pushing this through, the Democrats would have to win not only the White House but a big Senate majority in 2020.

In both cases, the Democratic candidates embracing these ideas are trying to sell blatantly partisan moves as process reforms.

These are the kind of abstract political debates that, while important, are unlikely to motivate voters as much as climate change or health care. But what Warren and company are counting on is that they could excite the kind of activists who turn out in Democratic primaries.",210,Fox News,"Why Democrats want to abolish Electoral College, pack Supreme Court"
"BANGKOK - Pocketbook issues may not sway the outcome of Sunday's election in Thailand, given the bigger debate among voters over whether they support or oppose the military junta that has ruled the country since a 2014 coup.

Experts say that widespread dissatisfaction, especially among the have-nots, with how the economy is doing may be balanced out by strong support for the junta from wealthier Thais and those who have seen military rule as a welcome respite from the political unrest that has tarnished Thai politics for more than a decade.

""The economy is not doing all that great. But it's also not doing all that badly. It may be that in this case it would have just a neutral impact on the election's outcome,"" said Chris Baker, a historian and expert on Thai politics.

""It will be a vote on the military. Whether you like them. Whether you approve of them. Whether you'd like them to stay,"" he said.

Still, lagging wages, a precarious job market and falling commodities prices have made the daily struggle to get by a key concern, and major parties are wooing voters with promises of cash handouts, farm subsidies, small-business tax breaks and other benefits.

Such populist strategies were the specialty of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose allied parties have won every national election since 2001 in part by appealing to the rural masses who make up the majority of Thai voters. Yet his popularity and strongman personality alienated many in Bangkok and among the nation's traditional elite and his government was toppled in a 2006 coup.

After more than a decade of sometimes violent protests, counter protests and legal and extralegal intervention, Thaksin -- who lives in exile to avoid what he says is a politically motivated jail term -- remains revered by many and reviled by others.

On Sunday, the choice for many will boil down to what they value more, the better economic times associated with Thaksin and his allies or the relative political calm associated with military rule.

Here's a look at some of the key stakeholders:

FARMERS and WORKERS: It's widely agreed that deep seated structural problems are slowing Thailand's progress, as the elite grab a large share of the benefits of the country's growth. In the countryside, incomes and access to good education and other public services lag far behind. While poverty has declined markedly, to below 10 percent of the population by most measures, farm productivity has lagged, with rice and corn yields stagnating or falling behind those in neighboring countries. Even in the industrial sector, productivity -- one key to raising incomes -- has not kept pace with other countries in the region. Farmers are encumbered by debt as costs outstrip what they can bring in as prices for key commodities like rice and rubber languish. These voters, a majority of the electorate, benefited from ""Thaksinomics"" and are strong supporters of parties aligned with the former prime minister. Yet they are also used to seeing their choices at the ballot box overruled by military intervention or court rulings they see as politically biased.

URBAN MIDDLE CLASS: Thailand's urban middle class centered in Bangkok is riven by divided interests. On the one hand they were the forces that ousted previous military governments that clung to power for too long, such as in the early 1990s, and took great pride in Thailand's emergence as a democratic, middle-income nation. Yet they were the same masses who took to the streets multiple times over the past dozen years to seek the ouster of Thaksin and his allies, who they saw as corrupt and who they claimed bought the votes of the rural majority with populist policies. Many boycotted the last attempted election in 2014 and welcomed the coup that followed as a way to jumpstart what they said were needed reforms. While many are unhappy over a lack of reforms in education, the police, state industries and government bureaucracy, they are also wary of a return to the political unrest that has come hand-in-glove with civilian rule in recent times. ""There is still a very strong conservative trend in the Thai middle class who will settle for peace and order,"" Baker said.

YOUNG PEOPLE: Thailand has 7 million eligible potential swing voters: the over-18s who are getting to vote for the first time. Among them are university graduates who find it difficult to get good-paying jobs. There are also legions of young people, many without a degree, in the informal workforce -- running street stalls, ferrying passengers by motorbike taxis and filling other casual, low-skilled occupations. In the last election, Thaksin's proxy party was able to appeal to such workers with promises to raise the minimum wage and to guarantee a minimum starting salary for university graduates. While the current crop of first-time voters may be too young to feel nostalgia for Thaksin, there's little affection for army rule.

BIG BUSINESS: The huge conglomerates that dominate the Thai economy and the wealthy families who own them are generally conservative and eager to avoid political uncertainty. So are foreign businesses deeply invested in many of Thailand's export-oriented manufacturing industries. The chances are that big business will come out ahead whoever wins. But a public backlash if the election's outcome is perceived as unfair could harm the investment environment.

THE MILITARY: Having written a new constitution that stacks the odds in its favor, the military is seeking the best of both worlds by returning coup maker-turned-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to the premiership as the head of an ostensibly civilian government. Even if it somehow fails to get its man in the top post, the current junta has ensured that any future governments must adhere to its 20-year plan for the nation. The military's self-interests would be ensuring it continues to have a strong say over its generous budget, and avoiding being included in future reforms that could seek to curb its might, both politically and financially. A victory Sunday would help keep a status quo already aligned in its favor. Nevertheless, while the military is adamantly conservative, it is also highly factional and a future coup can never be ruled out, even against itself.",211,Fox News,Pocketbook issues eclipsed by military role in Thai election

So it's OK to degrade, demean and harass a woman so long as she's a conservative and so long as her name is Tomi Lahren, huh, Game?

Well, I'm Tomi Lahren and I have some ""Final Thoughts"" for you, Game, so listen up.

If you'll recall, a couple of months ago I was threatened by the rapper Cardi B.

Then I was pretty much attacked by the rap community, their fans, and followers at large.

Strangely, I am pretty used to it.

But there was one vile rapper -- I use the word ""rapper"" very loosely because he hasn't really been relevant in 10 years -- who calls himself ""The Game.""

His degrading posts (plural) on social media about me were so below-the-belt, sexually explicit and vile I never responded, until now.

See, I have no problem arguing political points or policy but this fool's attack on me had nothing to do with politics.

It was all personal, all disgusting, and yes, dare I say it, sexist?

I do. Sexist!

The things he said about me were perhaps the ugliest and most repulsive things I have ever read.

And I've read A LOT of nasty things about myself.

He kisses his daughter with that mouth, and that's what's also troubling.

He posted an Instagram photo of me with a caption so vile and so horrific I can't share it with you.

He then posted an unflattering photo of me from high school and joked how ugly I am, and how I had plastic surgery...which I didn't.

Yeah, Game, I was about 16-years-old in that photo and yep, it's an ugly photo of me but STILL I'm proud of it.

Wanna know why? Because guess where that photo was from? From an article in my local newspaper about getting a summer job.

I have thick skin, really thick skin, but I am still a human being. I am someone's daughter, someone's granddaughter, someone's girlfriend, and a person.

You don't have to like me. You can even call me ugly, dumb, or a whole dictionary full of horrible things, but the collection of things that have been said or directed at me from The Game and friends, is not OK. And it's not just that it's not OK to say those things to me...It's not OK period.

Look, I don't worry about me. I signed up for this.

I think about all the young ladies who follow me and read this stuff and see this stuff.

But this week Game took it a step further and defended his vile behavior on the day-time talk show, ""The Real"":

""It's never a woman thing. That post was about Tomi Lahren herself for her actions, and I wanted to post something that'd be brash about it, and I hope that it made her day bad, and her co-workers looked at her crazy, and she had a terrible day.""

Wow.

Not only is what he said about me disgusting, explicit and wrong -- I know girls see this stuff and think, I will never speak out like Tomi does and I will never be confident in my opinions because look what happens when you are -- you get treated like less than a human. And to attack my appearance when I was in high school, and now, really?

Where are the feminists? Since when has that been OK? Just because I'm Tomi?

Girls struggle enough with personal confidence and self-esteem and when they see rappers with millions of followers attack someone's appearance -- what message does that send?

I will NOT be silenced or intimidated by the filth that is hurled at me by low-class rappers.

And I know not all of you want this kind of public life, and I don't blame you.

I just hope, in your own life, you are strong enough to block out hate like this.

You will likely not experience it on the level I do, and I'm glad.

But you will experience it in some way, shape or form -- especially if you're a conservative and choose to be vocal and proud of it.

I don't back down and I don't stoop to their level because that's not how I was raised.

I may make political points that offend people and I'll own that, but I would never even THINK half of the things that are said about me and to me.

I wouldn't wish that kind of language on my worst enemy.

These ""Final Thoughts"" are very personal and they mean a lot to me.

"Intended to educate everyone, our college system has left millions struggling along on the path to full, independent American life.

Rodney Spangler first enrolled at the University of North Texas in 2001. There, he pursued a degree in what the school now calls ""integrative studies,"" focusing on history, philosophy, and criminal justice. Rodney also worked full time, and so attended UNT on and off until 2007.

For every semester of classes, Spangler took out student loans. When he left -- without a degree -- he estimates that he had about $30,000 in outstanding student debt.

""At first I always intended to repay them, but the first time I took a semester off, I started getting due notices/bills for them,"" Spangler told The American Conservative by email. ""[I s]tarted going back, but the ones that came due kept sending notices, like there was no 'pause' button.""

Overwhelmed by bills, Spangler simply stopped paying. Today, thanks to interest and delinquency penalties, he estimates his outstanding debt is about $60,000 -- double what it was. ""I just don't see how I can ever pay those off,"" Spangler wrote, ""short of winning the lottery.""

Of course, it's possible to go on living with a five-figure debt hanging over your head, but it imposes more than its fair share of limitations. When Spangler tried to get a job in law enforcement, he met all the requirements, but was denied because of his credit history.

""I had some of the highest placement scores they had seen,"" Spangler claims, ""but my credit report had too many negative marks."" With one or two exceptions, all of those marks were from student loans.

The weight of the debt has not only hindered Spangler's search for employment -- it has also affected his family and romantic life. He has had to rely on his parents to cosign for loans. And, he says, he has been ""a little reticent to pursue a serious relationship,"" thanks in part to fear of being judged for his debt.

Spangler is not alone: he's one of the 44 million Americans who holds student debt, 30 percent of the population who have attended college. Together, they owe about $1.5 trillion, a bigger burden than credit cards, auto loans, or any other non-mortgage debt.

That there is a student debt crisis is not news. Media sites report on it frequently; academics attend to it with increasing trepidation. But in focusing on the scale of the problem, we sometimes forget to think about how all that debt affects people's lives.

Specifically, the last 20 years of student debt accumulation -- driven largely by federal policy -- have radically shifted the life-courses of younger Americans, whether late Gen Xers like Spangler or Millennials. Millions of Americans now enter adulthood with a burden unfaced by their parents or grandparents, which in turn slows their family formation, alters labor market behavior, and represents a profound alteration to how they live out citizenship.

Americans, historically, had little schooling. In 1900, less than 10 percent went to or graduated from high school; by 1910, the median adult had completed only 8 years of schooling. Americans, since Tocqueville's time at least, have believed that education was the nursemaid of citizenship. But only recently has that come to mean more than primary schooling.

The modern, post-war economy, however, precipitated a radical change in America's educational composition. In 1962, just 19 percent had been to college; today, 61 percent have. The proportion actually graduating went from 9 to 35 percent in the same period. In short, over the past half century, higher education has gone from the exception to the norm.

Stretching back at least to the G.I. Bill, government has carried the lion's share for this transition. In 1965, the government began to offer its credibility as a guarantor of private student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. In the early 1990s, the Department of Education started issuing student loans itself, under the Federal Direct Loan Program.

The amount of debt held by the DOE rose steadily through the 1990s and early 2000s, then exploded during the Great Recession. Preston Cooper, an education research analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, told TAC that many Americans, forced out of the full-time workforce, opted to reskill -- and took on lots of debt to do so. The feds funded that choice: as of 2015, 91 percent of all student loans were publicly held.

Publicly available data on federal student loans thus get us most of the way to a picture of the student debtor population. Those data show that as federal loans became readily available, millions of Americans took them on.

Clearly, some older Americans -- especially ages 35 to 49 -- have debt, likely thanks to grad school and the Great Recession reskilling. But there is a pronounced disjuncture between even that group and America's younger adults. Among those who have attended (although not necessarily graduated from) college, more than half are in debt.

We can look closer for an even starker picture. The mode 25- to 34-year-old debtor has between $20,000 and $40,000 of debt -- the median annual salary for a recent college grad is about $50,000. Americans currently in and fresh out of college owe similarly high amounts.

Maybe student debt is not so bad. As David Leonhardt argued in a recent New York Times op-ed, it is in large part held by college-educated kids from the top income quartile, who can expect a substantial wage premium. Student debtors are likely to be well-off, and a college degree will make them more so.

Two issues complicate this argument, however. The first is what we might call the ""Somes"": those who, like Spangler, have more than a high school degree but less than a college degree, i.e. only ""some"" college experience. Federal survey data show that ""Somes"" account for the second-highest proportion of all adults and the highest proportion of 25 to 34 year-olds.

Whereas debt-holding college grads usually do well, Somes don't. Essentially all of the college wage premium accrues upon graduation, thanks to what economists call the ""sheepskin effect"" -- the earnings boost comes with the diploma.

The obverse of this is that Somes end up looking more like their peers with a high-school degree than a college one -- except, that is, for a lot of student debt. As Leonhardt notes, 40 percent of Some borrowers defaulted on their loans, compared to just 8 percent who graduated. For a significant part of the student-loan-debtor population, then, there is no college-degree cushion.

There's a bigger problem: even among grads, student debt slows the set of life choices we commonly associate with adulthood. Even if most debtors eventually get their lives on track, debt has substantial effects on how long it takes them to do so.

Unsurprisingly, having debt shapes young Americans' job market decisions. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley found that grads with debt pick higher salary jobs, often over ""public-interest"" positions. They also found that bearing debt may affect students' ""academic decisions during college"" in a way likely tied to their ultimate career trajectory. Young Americans may be more cautious about entering low-paying, high-social-significance roles -- including politics, an area where older Americans are conspicuously over-represented.

Then there's homeownership. Americans in their 20s have always been unlikely to buy, but Millennials may be delaying well into their 30s. The couple profiled in a recent Politico article on Millennials' homebuying were 32 and 33, respectively; both cited their student debt as delaying their purchase. Analysis of British homeownership trends shows this is a common phenomenon, linking increased student debt levels to a ""delay"" in ""first-time homeownership transition.""

All of this contributes to late family formation. Fewer young adults are married than ever and multiple analyses have found that student debt encourages cohabitation and reduces marriage among college-educated women (although, interestingly, not among men). That translates into less sex, and correspondingly fewer kids. A New York Times/Morning Consult poll found that 64 percent of young adults had fewer kids because of the cost of childcare (and, presumably, their ability to meet it); among those who claimed not to want kids, 13 percent explicitly cited their student debt as the reason.

All of this is fairly intuitive -- if you have five figures of debt, paying it down will inevitably require trade-offs, which means delaying life. But it means that college debt directly slows young adults on the path their parents enjoyed -- homes, marriage, children, etc.

That's the big problem. Even bracketing the Somes, spiraling student debt has had a lasting impact on how hard young Americans have to work just to make it to the same place as previous generations. The new normal of debt necessarily alters the shape of American life.

Crushing debt and delayed lives are of course unpleasant individual experiences, but there is a deeper problem of political equity. In America, there is a strong connection between education and the ideal of citizenship -- a republic requires an educated populace. This connection implicates more than just reading and writing -- Eleanor Roosevelt contended that every discipline, from Latin to mathematics, informs good citizenship.

In a society where education is a prerequisite for civic participation, raising the floor of expected educational attainment, we thought, would make better citizens. This was, for example, the instinct which induced President Barack Obama to call on ""every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training.... every American will need to get more than a high school diploma.""

But what is meant as inclusionary ends up exclusionary. The explosion of student debt, with its concurrent effects on debtors' lives, means that many who go to college struggle along on the path to full, independent American life. Deviations from life course constrain young Americans in their ability to give back to their communities, to raise families, to buy homes, to teach responsible membership in society -- in short, to be a citizen. The debt-financed education revolution risks retarding precisely the democratic goal it was meant to serve.

When we spoke, Rodney Spangler was 39, almost 40. He intends to go back to school next fall. He will still be heavily in debt, although perhaps finally getting a degree will help. Even so, he'll have worked for decades for a position his parents could have reached with a high school education.

The proportion of the population that is college-exposed broke 50 percent in 2000 and has risen steadily since then. According to the Pew Research Center, the rising generation of ""post-Millennials"" are expected to be the most educated ever, with nearly 60 percent of those over 18 enrolled in college. If, as so many have argued, a new generation needs a renewed commitment to American citizenship, then they also need help surpassing the limitations stopping them from most fully living that commitment.",213,The American Conservative,The Student Loan Trap
"Sit down, folks, this is going to be one of those long, rambling posts. TL;DR? Read Houellebecq.

I see that there's a lot of online controversy over this out-of-context quote from my Christchurch post over the weekend:

Everything Tarrant identifies as qualities of a disintegrating Western civilization is true.

If you read the entire post, it's crystal-clear that I'm not endorsing Tarrant's actions or his manifesto, but rather pointing out that the killer identifies truthful things in his critique of a decadent West. As I said in the piece, in the same way that we have to recognize that Islamic terrorists base their murderous ideology in some true things, we have to do the same thing when it comes to white nationalist terrorists like Brenton Tarrant.

There are many people who react emotionally, and who think that to give any ground at all to terrorists is to in some way justify them. A lot of us on the Right -- I was probably one of them for all I know -- felt that way about the 9/11 terrorists. Clearly a lot of people on the Left feel that way about Tarrant. We always face the risk of falling victim to that double-edged French saying, ""To understand all is to forgive all."" That is, if we try too hard to enter into the mind of a criminal, we might end up agreeing that he did the right thing.

(Side note: a college professor told me recently that he was teaching the Albert Camus novel The Stranger to his students, and that none of them could grasp that the protagonist's signature act, killing an innocent Arab, was morally wrong. It wasn't that they were anti-Arab; it was that they understood why the title character did what he did, and forgave him for it. This is not the point Camus wanted to make!)

Let me give you an example of something I learned that rocked my world. Back around 2006 or so, I went to Dubai, to an Arab media conference. The event brought together journalists and TV producers from around the Arab world. I went to write about it. It would be fair to say that I had an unreflective view of the introduction of mass media into Arab culture. If anything, I thought it would be a good thing, to introduce some churn into those rigid societies. I was pretty optimistic.

I had a conversation there over coffee with a veteran journalist from Lebanon, a man who was a secularist. He told me that what Westerners don't understand is that the advent of satellite television and the Internet in the Arab world caused a tremendous shock to the systems of those countries. He said, and I'm paraphrasing,

""You in the West have had mass electronic media for almost 100 years, and you've all adjusted to the changes it has brought. Now, consider that a hundred years of modernization is suddenly appearing inside Arab cultures that are far more rigid and traditional than the West ever was in the modern period. How do you think people are going to react?""

I sat in on a panel of some young Westernized Arabs who were part of a project to bring MTV, or something like it (I can't recall precisely), to the Arab world. They were very optimistic about the positive social change they were sure their project was going to bring to the Middle East. But I had had a different conversation earlier with an expat Egyptian journalist living in the West, who was much more critical -- from a liberal point of view! She said that the advent of satellite TV in her country had mostly empowered religious conservatives. She came from a Muslim family that was part of the cultural elite, and had seen some of her sisters take the veil. She feared for the future. Her point to me was that the idea that introducing technology, especially media technology, into a traditional society can only bring positive change is dangerously naive.

I bring this up in context of the role immigration, multiculturalism, evolving standards on gender and sexuality, and globalist economics play in the development of Western societies. All these things are typically seen by liberals and progressives as unambiguously good things. But this is dangerously naive. To be clear, they are not unambiguously bad things either!

Here's what I mean. Take this excerpt from a Washington Post Plum Line interview with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination:

Plum Line: How do you view white nationalism as a policy problem?

Buttigieg: In the narrow tactical sense, it's something we need to stay ahead of and monitor the way you would any kind of violent radical movement from abroad.

There's a deeper phenomenon going on. As we see dislocation and disruption in certain parts of the country, from rural areas to my home in the industrial Midwest, and in the economy, this leads to a kind of disorientation and loss of community and identity. That void can be filled through constructive and positive things, like community involvement or family. And it can be filled by destructive things, like white identity politics.

Yes, it absolutely can. I find it hard to believe that that loss explains Tarrant, who seems to have been radicalized not so much from the circumstances of his life, but from his anti-social nature, and his living online. (It is worth noting too that many of the Islamist terrorist leader are not poor Muslim men, but those with educations.) Still, when people of any race or religion lose the things that ordinary folks have always used to understand who they are, and to find dignity in life, they become easy targets for hateful race fanatics, religious fanatics, or political fanatics.

Here's a thoughtful comment by a reader going by the moniker One Male:

Every time I read about poverty or the bribery scandal of rich people buying their children's way into colleges, the focus is always on poor blacks and Hispanics. There are more poor white people in the US than poor blacks and Hispanics combined. Having come from an impoverished area, I get to watch what society does to all these poor people. On top of the neglect they receive if they happen to be white men, they also get to endure verbal abuse and being blamed for the debauchery of the wealthy. Of several cousins and a brother, only one cousin and myself managed to go to college and make a career.

Regardless of whether all these poor white males are deserving of scorn or not. Regardless of whether they could do better for themselves or not. Constantly beating on a malnourished dog doesn't make the dog happy, more confident or docile. Beating on the dog will eventually result in hopelessness -- and we are already there. Now the dog is starting to attack. When it attacks it isn't going to care what hand it bites. It is going to bite whatever hand is nearest.

The other day in another post there was a debate about what a John said and Rod's own response was somewhat dismissive. What I'd like to highlight is that regardless of the merit of John's view, he and many like him believe it. They believe it because they live it, and when you're at the bottom every mole hill looks like a mountain. Countless white men in this country have no support, have no prospects and have no future.

My little brother is a great example. He didn't go to college and wasn't very smart but he was willing to work. He got a decent job doing hard work and ended up breaking a disk in his back. Now he is unhireable, and the company in question didn't pay for the medical charges. He'll never be married, never have kids and never attain what society constantly reminds him is success. He'll be told he's worthless, and on top of that, entitled.

The solution to society's ills are undiscussable. Families are important to happiness. For people to have families they have to have jobs and women willing to marry them. Statistics show that women don't marry below their own earnings or education. Everything is geared toward more women in the workforce. More women in college. More women in the military. More women in engineering. The net affect is a smaller and smaller pool of women willing to marry men like my brother.

No marriage no family. No family no connection to society. More men with nothing to lose and being told how worthless they are is a recipe for violence. Not because I want it to be, but because that is nature. And lo and behold, the brilliant thinkers of the world have decided that 'nature' no longer exists such that a man is a woman and a woman a man.

The illogic of our beliefs have been piling up for some 200 years now. That those beliefs are falling over on people and killing them is said to be senseless and yet ... it is not senseless. In fact it is the only logic that matters, and that logic is the base of all existence. It can be said to be natural because it is nature itself. Fight it at your own peril but you will lose. Nature doesn't care about right and wrong. Nature only cares about truth.

I have lots of criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement, but their existence forced me to think more about how the matter of policing looks from the point of view of many black Americans. It didn't kill me to consider their point of view, even if I couldn't agree with them fully. Along those lines, here are a couple of stories about displacement that I offer for your consideration.

Back in 2011, I moved back to my hometown in rural south Louisiana. West Feliciana Parish, my home, is the least populated parish in the state. People had been frustrated in the past few years with the inefficiency of the old-style ""police jury"" form of government, dating back to the early 19th century. Some local folks pushed for a new, update form of parish government. There were lots of public meetings to discuss the issues related to it. I started to attend them.

It was striking to me to see how racialized they were. Broadly speaking, whites were for the reform, blacks were against it. In the public meetings, some black citizens used paranoid, even racist, rhetoric to demonize the reform. I found this hard to understand. The arguments for the new system were very clear. If you didn't like the proposal, then make an argument against it. Don't rely on calling those who support it racist, and accusing them of making a power grab. In fact, some of the whites favoring the reform were friends of mine, and people I knew to be political liberals. They were just tired of the good ol' boy system, and wanted change.

Then I thought about the black people who were coming to the meetings and speaking out. All of them were older than me, and had lived through a time in the parish when the white leaders were members of the Klan, or at least fellow travelers. That was within living memory. It wasn't part of my memory, and it wasn't part of the memory of many of those white citizens who wanted change (they had moved there since the 1970s). But you don't just set aside those experiences. (And by the way, if you want to know why I will never, ever support white nationalism and white supremacy, read this 1964 article about events in my own hometown.)

What's more, in the lifetime of the black people at the meeting, the black population of the parish had gone from just over 50 percent to something like 33 percent today. I can't find the official demographic projections, but if memory serves, the black population was expected to decline in the next decade to around 20 percent of the overall (N.B., you have to be careful looking up Census figures; West Fel is home to 5,000 or so inmates at Angola State Penitentiary, most of whom are black). It hit me at one point in one of those meetings that the black people of the parish have lived through a steep decline in their political power, based on population decline. Once the agricultural economy went away in West Fel, there was little work for unskilled people to do. Unskilled black laborers moved to where they could find work.

The black people objecting to the new proposal might have been wrong -- I believed they were -- and they might even have been paranoid, even racist. Still, these were people who had finally achieved the right to vote, just in time for the economy to shift under their feet, and for an economics-driven exodus of blacks out of the parish to get underway. Think of the trauma! This is not to justify their political case against reform, or to paternalistically sympathize with their racist fear. But it is to acknowledge that what reformers were asking of these citizens was a lot. It was also the case that some of the blacks who spoke out against the plan were not college educated. These were country people who had not mastered the mode of discourse educated people of all races use. They were at times crude. But again, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel bad for their loss, and their sense of displacement.

Another story I lived through. Back in 2005, my wife and I bought a renovated house in a gentrifying neighborhood of Dallas. We had moved to the city in 2003 from New York, and didn't have much in savings. We paid $165,000 for it. We loved the little Arts & Crafts bungalow. The neighborhood was fine, but close enough to the bad part of town that we could some nights hear gunshots. Some of our friends in the city thought that we lived in the barrio.

The thing is, in the 1980s and most of the 1990s, that neighborhood of early 20th century houses had been a slum plagued by drug violence. All those beautiful old houses were falling down. Our neighbors were a working-class Hispanic couple, and told us how much nicer it was to live in the neighborhood with all the new people (read: gentrifiers) coming in, because now it was safe to walk down the street, and to sit on your front porch at night without having to worry about stray bullets.

The neighborhood was changing fast. The people who were there before we got there -- poor and working-class Hispanics -- were moving out. They were selling their houses and getting good prices for them. Besides, they didn't want to be in a neighborhood where the people weren't like them. Before we moved in, I had a vaguely hostile opinion of gentrifiers, but living in the neighborhood, I could see how gentrification had done objective good for the neighborhood. Houses of historic architectural significance had been saved and restored. Streets that had been war zones were coming back to life. Our neighbors remembered a time when our own house had been a drug house. The man who bought it cleaned it up and made it livable again for a family, not a junkie.

But the people who had lived in that neighborhood before had been displaced. When we moved in 2010 to Philadelphia, we sold the house in a real estate market that had not recovered from the 2008 crash. Despite having put about $50,000 in improvements into the house, we sold it for exactly what we paid for it. That was the only offer we got. You can imagine how we felt a couple of summers ago when we saw the same house on the market for something like $370,000! The buyers had done nothing to it; the market had simply changed that much in seven years.

We heard too that our Hispanic neighbors had moved away. I imagine they got a good price for their house, which needed a lot of work. But I also imagine that as retirees, they could no longer afford the property taxes in that gentrified neighborhood. Had we stayed in Dallas, I'm not quite sure that we would have been able to keep up with the property taxes.

That was the first house I ever purchased. You know how they say that when you have your first child, suddenly you start looking at the world differently? That's how it was with buying my house. I had lived as a renter in a lot of different places over the years, but I had never really regarded my previous neighborhoods the way I did when I looked at it as a property owner. I had a financial stake in the neighborhood's stability, and that meant that I cared more than I ever had before about signs of improvement or decline. That, plus trying to understand how what I had thought was unambiguous progress -- look, the neighborhood is being restored, and it's becoming family-friendly again! -- might not look that way to my neighbors ... well, it made me realize that issues related to displacement were more complicated than I had reckoned.

When Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam's 2007 study on diversity came out -- the controversial one in which he found that the more diverse a community is, the less social cohesion and social capital it has -- I understood it in a way that I wouldn't have before, as someone who didn't own a home in a neighborhood. Previously, I had believed that anyone who didn't want people of a different race moving into their neighborhood was nothing but a racist, end of story. Now I saw that those people might, in fact, be racist, but they might also have a normal human instinct to want to live around people like themselves, because it's easier to trust people who are like you in most ways. People like my wife and me -- educated, and formed by living in institutions and in social communities that were fairly diverse -- were not inclined to think about diversity and society in morally complex ways. It went against the narrative of our professional class.

Living and working in Dallas during the first decade of this century, and trying to get a handle on the immigration issue, taught me how educated cosmopolitans like me game the system to roll over people who don't have the same skills we do to manufacture the narrative. I've mentioned a number of times in this space how invisible poor and working-class white people, and their interests, were in our media deliberations on the immigration issue. Generally speaking, those people were thought of by people like us as backwards racists who didn't need to be consulted or considered, only overcome.

We media people didn't send our kids to public schools whose classrooms were overwhelmed by migrant children who spoke no English. We didn't have to use public hospitals whose waiting rooms were jammed tight with immigrants, legal and illegal. Our lives pretty much intersected with immigrants only at restaurants and when we needed carpentry or lawn work. They were not a threat to our way of life.

True story: I went to an impoverished Dallas school once, around 2004, as part of a press tour. I saw a sweet little Hispanic boy, the son of immigrants, stand in a class room and give an oral report on his hero. Know who he chose? Santa Anna, the great villain of Texas history, the general who took the Alamo. I kid you not. I thought, man, Texas is changing. I am not a Texan, and had no feelings about the Alamo one way or the other. But you'd have to be an idiot not to know that many native Texans -- white ones, anyway -- have very strong feelings about the Alamo as a condensed cultural symbol.

Here's the thing: the kind of Texans who feel strongest about things like the Alamo are also the ones least likely to have access to a sympathetic media, and least likely to be able to articulate their concerns in a way that the dominant cultural and media narrative would find acceptable. Come to think about it, in that way they're a lot like the poor rural black folks in West Feliciana.

I bring all of this up because of the controversy over the New Zealand shooting, and my mention in an earlier post that I believe the murderer was not wrong to mention demographic shifts in Europe as a sign of the decline of European culture. This is in no way to endorse Tarrant's racist conclusions, nor certainly to endorse his violence. It's simply to point out that it's folly to expect people to sit back and watch their countries' populations decline relative to that of migrants moving in, and to be sanguine about it. Even if you favor immigration, intelligent political management means that you have to take very seriously the social disruption that this kind of tectonic social change will bring.

Last year in France, I met a farmer who had been to nine funerals of neighboring farmers who had committed suicide. Nine funerals! The French government believes that these small farmers have to be allowed to die off because they are economically inefficient. Do you think this farmer I talked to, who had buried nine of his neighbors, gives a rat's rear end about whether or not he is sufficiently diverse and committed to cosmopolitan international values to satisfy people in the salons of Paris? The only thing keeping him together, body and soul, was his profound Catholic faith.

Guess whose new novel is about people like that farmer? That's right, Michel Houellebecq's.

European culture is either dying, or it's changing into something we don't yet know. Wherever you come down on that issue, nobody can deny that the changes underway now are massive, and that they are driving European politics. (This is also true of US politics, though less so.) When people are not allowed to discuss these changes without being called racist, then the only ones you will have speaking out are actual racists. The 21st century is going to be a century of unprecedented migration around the globe, in part driven by global warming, and in part by the radical imbalance in population growth in Africa. Look:

If you are a European looking at this graph, you must be filled with a sense of foreboding. The politics of Europe for the rest of this century are going to be driven by nothing greater than migration. Has there ever been an entire civilization that has peaceably yielded to an alien civilization moving into its territory, if it had any alternative? I'm not asking to be rhetorically provocative. These questions have to be faced honestly by political leaders of all parties.

Go back to the top of this long piece, and read what Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg had to say about the white working class, and their sense of displacement. There is no way that any political leader can speak meaningfully to them if they believe that that leader sees them as losers who deserve their fate, because they're bigots. Similarly, no political leader can speak to blacks, Hispanics, or anybody else with credibility if those populations see them as losers who deserve their fate. Our own politics in the US is going to grow increasingly nasty and divisive because our political parties have become so tribalized. Many of us are coming to believe that the Other Party sees people like us as the Enemy. I know I do. You -- left or right -- probably do too.

We have to find some other way. Do you think we can? I'm not hopeful, but I know that if we don't, the alternative is a future with a lot more people in it like the New Zealand killer. They won't all be young white males. They will come from all kinds of backgrounds, ethnic and otherwise, as people fear that they are losing something that gives them dignity, meaning, and purpose. The ruling class in this country -- I'm talking about people like me: educated people with stable jobs and families, and with megaphones -- had better pay attention. I return to the lesson I learned from watching the angry black people protesting against local governmental reform. Their anger and anxiety made no logical sense -- until you thought about how much they endured under white supremacy, and how they were watching their political power slip through their fingers, because their population had declined so starkly in a single lifetime.

There was no way they could get what they wanted, politically. They just did not have the numbers within the polity to sustain the power they once, all to briefly, held. The new system was not designed to disempower them at all. They had simply failed to show up for the future, same as the native European populations today (though in the case of Europeans, it's a matter of sub-replacement fertility; in my home parish, it's a matter of long-term economic in-migration of whites and out-migration of blacks). The point is, managing this kind of loss within a community's members, and not just treating them as history's sore losers, requires a lot of political skill, including the ability to empathize with the displaced, and in a more meaningful way than simply pulling a long face and saying, pro forma, ""I'm sorry for your loss.""

I wish there were a clear, easy solution to these problems. In my part of the world, it's not hard to see poor people -- white and black -- who are caught in intractable situations of despair because of the choices they have made, and the way they look at the world and their place in it. I am thinking of a particular white family I know whose members are just barely getting by, and who are caught up in a tangled mess of marital infidelity, abandoned children, drug and alcohol abuse, and so forth. If those folks won the lottery tonight, they'd be broke in a year, and some of them would be dead from drug overdoses. Those people's poverty and despair is not the fault of George Soros, or immigrants, or black people, or anybody else except (primarily) themselves. But that's just that particular family. If one of the young men in that clan became Very Online, he might find white nationalism to be very much to his liking, because it blames other people for his miserable situation.

On the other hand, the kinds of jobs that gave people like that a way to support themselves despite their flaws aren't around anymore, not like they used to be. That clan doesn't have anything to do with religion, but if they did, they would be hard-pressed to find churches that expected much out of them in terms of changing their behavior. Society around here has become far, far more accepting than it was only 50 years ago, when I was a kid. On the up side, you are free to fail miserably, and nobody will care. On the down side, you are free to fail miserably, and nobody will care.

The changes that have come over our country and our civilization over the past 50 years are staggering. Think back to what I said in the beginning of this post about the Arab media conference. There was no way to hold back the technological changes coming to the Arab world -- nobody I talked to there thought they were -- but those I spoke with did warn me about the instability and radicalism that would be unleashed by these changes.

Come to think of it, I had a conversation at that same conference with an American academic who was an expert on the Mideast. I won't name him here, to protect his family in Syria. He was talking about his family members there, and how they and so many Syrians were not admirers of the Assad regime, but they had come to support him out of abject fear that the civil war in neighboring Iraq would come to their country. By then I had soured on the Iraq War, but I still found it hard to work my American mind around the idea of believing that it was better to support a murderous dictator who tortured his opponents than accept the risks of freedom.

Now look at Syria. It has been destroyed by civil war. So much for us naive Americans and our refusal to understand how tribalism works within the fallen human condition.

I'll leave you with this line from the sociologist Robert Nisbet, in his classic midcentury book The Quest For Community. He's talking here about modern man: ""What he has become isolated from is the sense of meaningful proximity to the major ends and purposes of his culture.""

What are the major ends and purposes of our culture? Of European culture? Of Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand culture? Can we even say anymore?

I don't think we can. This is why we are disintegrating. If we can't find a way to reintegrate ourselves strongly around something life-affirming, then we had better find a way to manage the disintegration with as little violence as possible. We don't have all the time in the world to figure this out.",214,The American Conservative,Disintegration And Its Discontents
"Americans view Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert as the most liberal late-night hosts on television, according to a new poll from The Hollywood Reporter.

Some 42 percent of Americans think that both Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert lean liberal. They are closely followed by Jimmy Fallon and Bill Maher, at 40 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Overall, most Americans think that late-night in general leans left.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Americans overwhelmingly think that the majority of late-night hosts in general tend to lean more to the left politically. Some 50 percent of respondents said late-night hosts are ""more liberal"" while 12 percent thought these personalities were neutral and 11 percent deemed them ""more conservative.""

Finally, the poll's respondents generally tend to like the major network late-night hosts, while not being fans of the cable news hosts. For instance, only 21 percent of respondents had a favorable impression of TBS host Samantha Bee.

Americans seem to have the most favorable impression of Jimmy Fallon among late-night personalities, with 58 percent of respondents saying they generally like the host. The Tonight Show host is followed by ABC's Jimmy Kimmel (56 percent favorable), TBS' Conan O'Brien (48 percent), CBS' Stephen Colbert (44 percent) and NBC's Seth Meyers (40 percent).

Meanwhile, 33 percent of respondents viewed HBO's Bill Maher favorably, with Comedy Central's Trevor Noah (30 percent), HBO's John Oliver (28 percent) and TBS' Samantha Bee (21 percent) trailing by that measure.

The poll's results are interesting, as Americans seem to view Jimmy Fallon as more liberal than hosts like Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah, both of whom have been far more consistently anti-Trump than Fallon.

Fallon, like all late-night hosts, leans to the left when he discusses politics, but in general is less political.

According to recent television ratings, liberal viewers seem to respond more strongly to more outspoken hosts. Colbert beat Fallon in the major network ratings for the past two years.",215,Breitbart,"Poll: Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert Most Liberal Late-Night Hosts, Samantha Bee Least Popular"

DEMOCRATS FACE A 2020 CHOICE PROBLEM

Boston Globe: ""With the party's first national debates less than three months away, and the New Hampshire primary less than 11 months away, the big challenge for ... [candidates:] how to stand out in such a crowded pack, without doing anything so bold it could backfire. ... A big field without an obvious front-runner could shake out in any number of ways, but history suggests it will most likely end up following one of two paths. The first is the long, (mostly) collegial search for a consensus candidate. That's what we saw with the relatively large Democratic field in 1988 (11 candidates, plus a few fringe). In that race, the big names either sat out or flamed out early, and the campaign turned into a slow-moving grind... The 2004 campaign started out in similar fashion... The model for the second possible path is a lot more recent: The Republicans in the 2016 campaign. ... After all, what an effective primary campaign does is put the candidates through a punishing stress test that toughens and strengthens them, giving everyone confidence that they have identified the strongest possible contender for the general election. ... So this is the tightrope that Democratic contenders will have to walk: They'll need to be unfiltered and distinctive enough to break out of the pack, but not so candid that they get disqualified by the wrath of summary judgment on social media.""

California's early primary poised to pull 2020 Democrats further left - Fox News: ""Unlike past elections, California will hold its primary early in the season - on March 3, 2020. That means the West Coast state, and its famously liberal voters, will hold extra influence this cycle. And while the 2020 candidates still have to connect with supporters in earliest-voting Iowa and New Hampshire - with their more moderate-leaning electorates - California's combination of an early primary and massive delegate count could motivate the field to run decisively in the progressive lane from the start. ... In another sign of California's emerging influence this cycle, putative front-runner Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to visit the state this week. ... Not only is California's primary now slated for Super Tuesday in March, but early voting is set to start around the time of the Iowa caucuses. With that in mind, Sanders' visit this week is likely the start of a political gold rush of sorts, as the 2020 candidates look west for electoral gold.""

TIME OUT: HOUSTON, WE HAVE A GOOD BOY PROBLEM

Atlantic: ""To be clear, NASA's ambitious plans for missions to the moon and Mars do not include dogs. ... But dogs have been to space. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union strapped dogs into capsules and launched them into the sky. ... But [NASA] suggests that, unlike the Soviet dogs, a canine on Mars would not be a lab animal, but a valued companion on the journey to a distant land. ... Designing a spacesuit for a dog wouldn't be the hard part... NASA has decades' worth of experience in manufacturing spacesuits, which are like little spacecraft of their own... The problem is the dog's experience inside that spacesuit, which would circulate the same air over and over. ... The enclosed environment of a spacesuit would be stifling. ... There's also the question of the dog relieving itself. Astronauts wear adult diapers during spacewalks; Mars explorers would have to train their canine companions to become comfortable with a similar arrangement.""

BETO, WARREN CALL ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

Fox News: ""Another 2020 Democrat has come out against the Electoral College. After addressing students at Penn State University on Tuesday afternoon, Beto O'Rourke lamented Hillary Clinton's failure to take the White House despite winning the popular vote, adding there is 'a lot of wisdom' in calls for change. 'I think there's a lot to that. Because you had an election in 2016 where the loser got 3 million more votes than the victor,' O'Rourke said in a video posted online. ... 'If we really want everyone to vote, to give them every reason to vote, we have to make sure their votes count and go to the candidate of their choosing. So I think there's a lot of wisdom in that.' O'Rourke's support for potentially abolishing the Electoral College came one day after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pushed a similar proposal. 'Every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College,' Warren told an audience at the historically black Jackson State University in Mississippi.""

History shows Dems' call isn't all that surprising - WaPo: ""Defenders of the electoral college system argue that it mandates visits to states like those above which might otherwise be overlooked. ... That debate aside, there's certainly no reason to be surprised that Warren would call for the electoral college system to be thrown out. There have been four elections since 1860 in which the electoral vote has given the presidency to the candidate who lost the popular vote: 1876, 1888, 2000 and 2016. As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has pointed out, Republicans have won the popular vote only once in her lifetime, but have held the White House for 10 years. In each of those four elections where the popular vote winner lost the electoral vote, the losing candidate was a Democrat.""

Court-packing is another test on the left - The Hill: ""Whether or not to expand the Supreme Court is emerging as a key litmus test in the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential primary field. Once dismissed as a fringe idea, reforming the nation's highest court is gaining traction with a growing number of Democratic 2020 candidates as progressive outside groups and high-profile officials, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, have vaulted the idea into the national spotlight. The courts have emerged as a lightning rod during the Trump administration for the Democratic Party's resurgent base, which remains deeply bitter over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) decision to block Merrick Garland, President Obama's final Supreme Court nominee. Supporters argue that sweeping reforms, including expanding the number of justices, are needed to counteract Trump and McConnell, who they say have 'packed' the judicial system with conservative judges -- including two Supreme Court justices and a record number of influential appeals court picks.""

REPORT: DEUTSCHE BANK LOANED TRUMP OVER $2 BILLION

NYT: ""Mr. [Donald] Trump and Deutsche Bank were deeply entwined, their symbiotic bond born of necessity and ambition on both sides... Then Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, and the German bank shifted into damage-control mode, bracing for an onslaught of public scrutiny, according to several people involved in the internal response. ... More than two years later, Mr. Trump's financial ties with Deutsche Bank are the subject of investigations by two congressional committees and the New York attorney general. Investigators hope to use Deutsche Bank as a window into Mr. Trump's personal and business finances. Deutsche Bank officials have quietly argued to regulators, lawmakers and journalists that Mr. Trump was not a priority for the bank or its senior leaders and that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former Deutsche Bank executives and board members, most of them with direct knowledge of the Trump relationship, contradict the bank's narrative.""

FOX TO HOST HOWARD SCHULTZ TOWN HALL

Politico: ""He may not yet be a 2020 presidential candidate, but Fox News is already treating former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz like one, complete with his own town hall event scheduled for next month. Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will host the event, which is scheduled for for April 4 in Kansas City, Missouri, the network announced Tuesday. The town hall event will focus on 'Schultz's potential candidacy and the issues he plans to tackle,' Fox News said. Schultz sparked a wave of criticism from the left earlier this year when he announced he would explore a possible run for president as a centrist, independent candidate. In touting his potential bid, Schultz trashed the Democratic Party, of which he was previously a member, criticizing its lurch to the left in recent years. He argued that he could garner the votes of centrist Democratic and Republican voters unhappy with President Donald Trump but uncomfortable with voting for a liberal Democrat.""

Keep an eye on Andrew Yang - FiveThirtyEight: ""[Andrew] Yang is the only 2020 candidate thus far to put a universal income front and center, and his campaign says it's been key to attracting support. But it's probably not a strong enough issue to propel Yang to victory on its own. A Gallup poll from 2017 found the concept to be divisive -- 48 percent supported a universal basic income, while 52 percent opposed it. ... That said, if Yang does indeed make the debate stage, he could succeed in making the issue a part of the national conversation. ... We'd expect Yang to get a good deal of support from The Left; most Americans think providing a universal income is a socialist position (though it has conservative adherents as well), and Yang has taken progressive views on a host of other issues. But he may not speak the language of The Left: He's frank in saying 'I'm a capitalist,' and his campaign manager, Zach Graumann, says that the campaign doesn't subscribe to the 'capitalist/socialist dichotomy.' Yang's strongest constituencies might be Millennials and Hispanic and Asian voters.""

Booker swipes at candidates for bragging about marijuana use - WaPo: ""Sen.

But he suggested that it was inappropriate for lawmakers to make light of the issue when some in society face legal repercussions for similar actions.

In a radio interview last month, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) ... laughingly acknowledged that she has used marijuana in the past... Sen.

"President Donald Trump's son, Donald Junior, has said British Prime Minister Theresa May should have listened to his father's advice on how to conduct Brexit negotiations as the process to extricate the United Kingdom from the European Union bounces from one crisis to the next.

The comments from Donald Junior came in an opinion column published in British right of centre, formerly conservative, newspaper the Daily Telegraph, where Mr Trump echoed previous comments by the President and Brexit leader Nigel Farage by linking the Brexit referendum to the 2016 Presidential election, and the forthcoming 2020 race.

It has now been 1,000 days since the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, but despite nearly three years of 'negotiations' between the government and the European Union, the country seems as far as ever from actually leaving. Prime Minister May has even gone so far as threatening the country with no Brexit at all if politicians don't line up to support her unpopular and controversial Brexit deal.

Mr Trump compared the no-holds-barred tactics by the British and European establishment to stop Brexit from going ahead to attacks on his father in the U.S., stating that the fight for independence was not yet over and that ""the people of both the UK and the US must reaffirm the decisions they made in 2016 to stand up for themselves against the global elite.""

Noting the ""desperate, last-gasp attempt by those previously in power"" to overturn the 2016 revolutions, Mr Trump was particularly scornful of UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who has led the United Kingdom through the bulk of the Brexit process, while achieving little for the British people.

Rhetorically asking whether the promises of May and other top UK political figures to honour the result of the referendum was just a ruse, Mr Trump called on the UK establishment to respect democracy:

Since 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised on more than 50 separate occasions that Britain would leave the EU on March 29 2019. She needs to honour that promise.

But Mrs May ignored advice from my father, and ultimately, a process that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo.

Now, the clock has virtually run out and almost all is lost - exactly as the European elites were hoping. Some pro-Brexit politicians even suggest that Mrs May herself is trying to sabotage Brexit, by insisting that Parliament agree to a deal that essentially keeps Britain bound to the EU indefinitely.

Mr Trump noted that the fast approaching Brexit deadline, due next Friday, March 29th, was almost certainly to be cancelled to give the political class even more time than the nearly three years they have already had, and wrote with apparent regret that democracy in the UK was ""all but dead.""

The comments by the high-profile son of the United States President seem to reflect a broad scepticism among British voters about the intentions of key individuals at the top of UK and EU politics. Breitbart London reported today on polling that found 44 per cent of UK respondents believed the government had set out to frustrate Brexit from day one, with just 27 per cent not believing that was the case.

Perhaps even more damning was the finding that 68 per cent did not even trust Members of Parliament to ""do the right thing by the country over Brexit"". Sixty-one per cent said they thought Brussels, the home of the European Union's institutions, was working to punish Britain by being as inflexible as possible during the Brexit process.

Trump Jr's comments on Mrs May ignoring advice from the President comes just days after President Trump, a long-standing supporter of Britain leaving the European Union, lamented the poor progress the Prime Minister had made to date. Speaking at the White House, Trump said: ""I'm surprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations, but I gave the Prime Minister my ideas of how to negotiate it, she didn't listen to that and that's fine but it could have been negotiated in a different manner.""

He concluded it was not looking possible for the UK to leave the EU on the March 29th date repeatedly promised to the British people, and remarked to the cameras: ""It's very sad to see what's happening there.""",218,Breitbart,"Democracy is 'All But Dead' in UK, Says Donald Trump Jr."
"Short honeymoon? Beto O'Rourke faces increased media scrutiny

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke attempted to play a practical joke on his wife by telling her that a turd he plucked from one of their children's diapers was an avocado, a friend of the couple told The Washington Post.

A gauzy profile of the couple that was published Tuesday and titled ""Are Amy and Beto O'Rourke the future of politics?"" described the former congressman as an ""impulsive and puckish"" character who proposed to his future wife on April Fool's Day.

OPINION: IS BETO O'ROURKE THE SELFIE-POLITICIAN AND METAPHOR FOR OUR TIMES?

Neither Beto nor Amy O'Rourke would confirm the baby poop story, though neither denied it and The Post reported that O'Rourke told the paper it sounded like something he would do. The O'Rourkes have three children: Ulysses, Molly, and Henry. It was not clear which child supplied the raw material for the reported prank.

The Post report also said that O'Rourke deployed a remote-controlled cockroach in the family kitchen and attempted to scare his wife in the shower, a la Anthony Perkins in the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic, ""Psycho.""

O'Rourke, who nearly unseated U.S. Sen Ted Cruz in last year's midterm elections, became the latest Democrat to enter the presidential race last week. Almost immediately after O'Rourke threw his hat into the ring, he was criticized for saying that his wife has raised their three children ""sometimes with my help"" at multiple campaign stops in Iowa.

O'Rourke said the criticism of his ""ham-handed"" attempt to highlight his wife's work in their marriage was ""right on.""

""Not only will I not say that again, but I will be much more thoughtful in the ways that I talk about my marriage,"" he said.

The controversy did not appear to lessen enthusiasm among his supporters. On Monday, O'Rourke's campaign announced that it had raised more than $6 million online with a day of his announcement, the most reported by any 2020 candidate.

O'Rourke raised $80 million in grassroots donations in his race against Cruz last year, all while largely avoiding money from PACs.

"Anthony Comello appears in Ocean County Superior Court in Toms River, NJ., for an extradition hearing. David McGlynn

The construction worker charged in the murder of Gambino godfather Francesco ""Franky Boy"" Cali seemed unhinged leading up to the brazen hit, friends told The Post on Tuesday.

Anthony Comello -- who showed up for his first court appearance Monday with ""MAGA forever"" and references to the conservative QAnon movement scrawled on his hand -- managed the Instagram account ""realamericasvoice_"" which is filled with anti-Democrat and pro-President Trump posts, said the pals, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

""He had a secret Instagram. He used to post crazy things about politics and Trump and Democrats,"" a source said.

The account kicked off in October with a post about Christine Blasey Ford, the sex-harass accuser of US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

""Horrible how they can try to ruin a man and his family name and it was all fake just to win. I hope you Dems never get power,'' raged the writer.

Another post was of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence from Jan. 20 with the caption, ""This has been the greatest and amazing two years in this great country (THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) for god, for country, for family @realdonaldtrump @vp you rocked the world. We the people are blessed for your SELFLESS PATH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THANK YOU.""

The 24-year-old suspect also used the social-media platform in his bizarre bid to boot Mayor de Blasio and Gov. Cuomo out of office.

""He was on Instagram live in front of the mayor's house a few weeks ago demanding de Blasio comes outside because he was under citizen's arrest,"" a source said. ""He was reaching out to people to sign a petition to get the governor and mayor out of office.""

The source said Comello had been messaging him lately to sign the petition.

""I thought he was whacked out so I didn't call him,"" the person said. ""In high school, he was a good kid. He hung out with the wrong crowd and did pills and smoked weed and got into fights but now it's like he's someone else. It's strange.""

Police sources said Comello showed up outside City Hall a few months ago in an attempt to make a citizen's arrest of the mayor.

Investigators believe Comello may have whacked Cali because the Mafia kingpin barred Comello from dating his niece.

It's unclear whether Comello knew who he was dealing with, one of his friends said.

""I'm not sure if he knew who Cali was but I know that it was over a girl, and if you ask me, he wasn't all in the head,"" said the person. ""And it's sad, because of who he killed, it's a matter of time before he's found dead in jail.""

Comello is expected to be extradited to New York to face charges following his court appearance in New Jersey.

"Progressive academic Nick Riemer wants to use Christchurch massacre to silence conservative voices (USyd Civil Liberties screenshot)

Rachel Withers says all white Australians are to blame for the Christchurch massacre. Excerpt:

I'm a white Australian. I know that blaming myself and my cohort is illogical, but I can't escape the feeling that all of white Australia is implicated in the deaths -- a white majority that has fomented and let foment hate. Though he may have labeled himself a European, 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant was an Aussie through and through, growing up in a country town north of Sydney, steeped in mainstream Australian racism and our particular national brand of Islamophobia. He grew up in the same Murdoch-controlled mass media environment that the rest of us did -- one that recently trashed Islam 2,891 times in a single year -- and under the same governments, with prime ministers who have repeatedly stoked anti-Muslim sentiment for votes, with one major party making it central to their electoral strategy.

White Australians must no longer tolerate those mainstream voices who give white supremacy a platform and megaphone. Instead of brushing aside the racism in our homeland, or pointing instead toward Trump and the United States, we must call out dog whistles in our own government, in our own backyard, every chance we get. We must condemn hate speech not just when someone like Anning goes ""too far,"" and we must deny visas to alt-right figures who come to our shores expecting a friendly welcome not just in the wake of right-wing terror attacks, but always. We must fight the normalization of Islamophobia. And above all we must accept responsibility for the hatred we have normalized. Rather than go easy on ourselves, we must go hard.

There you have it: the Australian Left is not about to let a good crisis go to waste. White Australians in general are no more responsible for Tarrant's vile attack than Muslim Australians in general are for Islamic terror attacks in that country. Again, though, this is about progressives instrumentalizing a terrible crime to silence their opponents.

They're coming after me, in fact. I am scheduled to give a series of lectures in Australia in May. The Ramsay Centre invited me to give a talk under its sponsorship. I had planned to speak about classical Christian education, and the importance to us all of learning about the roots of Western civilization as an antidote to the condition of ""liquid modernity"" (the concept is the Marxist sociologist Zygmunt Bauman's). Check out today's Sydney Morning Herald. Excerpt:

A writer who responded to the New Zealand massacre by noting that ""everything [shooter Brenton] Tarrant identifies as qualities of a disintegrating Western civilisation is true"" and an academic who runs a fan blog dedicated to right-wing speaker Milo Yiannopoulos are some of the ""distinguished visiting speakers"" being promoted by the controversial Ramsay Centre.

The Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation, which recently signed an agreement with the University of Wollongong to begin offering a new Bachelor of Arts in Western Civilisation, has come under fire for including The American Conservative editor Rod Dreher and University of Chicago academic Rachel Fulton-Brown on its 2019 lecture series speakers list.

Here's the article of mine to which the Morning Herald piece refers. I completely stand by it. As I've said, Brenton Tarrant is a devil from the pit of hell, but if we are going to fight terrorists -- white nationalist terrorists, Islamist terrorists, all kinds of terrorists -- we are going to have to face honestly the conditions that produce them. Here is the part of my essay that sparked controversy:

What is ""degeneration""? According to [Tarrant's] manifesto, it consists of:

Here's the chilling part: Everything Tarrant identifies as qualities of a disintegrating Western civilization is true. You may think that declining numbers of ethnic Europeans is a good thing, or something that has no particular moral meaning. But it really is happening. So are all the rest.

Who can deny this? Why is it not permitted by the Australian Left to bring this up? In no way to I endorse what Tarrant did. You don't have to endorse Islamist terrorism to recognize that the US invasion of Iraq is a factor in radicalizing Muslims. These leftists are choosing to be ignorant of social, political, and economic factors that lead to radicalization. In fact, they want to silence anyone who talks about them. The alt-right in the US can't stand me, considering me a Christian cuck, but Australian leftists are trying to pin the label onto me.

Here is left-wing Aussie academic Nick Riemer using the massacre to attempt to crush the Ramsay Centre, which simply wants to engage in education about the importance of Western civilization. Riemer calls the academic center an advocate for ""Western supremacist politics."" Do you believe that there is a thing called Western civilization, and it is worth studying, loving, and defending? Then you have the blood of Christchurch Muslims on your hands -- and you should be shamed out of the public square. This, according to Nick Riemer and Rachel Withers.

This -- the Left moving to silence any critics of progressivism, and to tar everyone on the Right as a white supremacist -- is exactly the kind of thing that Brenton Tarrant (who despises conservatives) wanted to happen. From his manifesto:

In this sense, Rachel Withers and Nick Riemer -- a Marxist activist and leader of the Sydney BDS movement who, I discovered via Google, has been waging an ideological campaign against the Ramsay Centre for some time -- are doing the bidding of the Christchurch terrorist more faithfully than the conservatives they deplore. It's disgusting. Here is a video clip of Riemer in 2015 defending the ""right"" of left-wing university students to shout down speakers. This man despises free speech and open inquiry.

I don't know if I'll be deplatformed in Australia. I don't know if I will be denied a visa. I'll say here that I do not want to be responsible for the destruction at the Left's hands of any of the organizations hosting my lecture tour, so I would not hold it against them if they withdrew their invitations. But if that happens, you will all be hearing from me, loud and often, on the subject of illiberal liberalism in Australia. And I hope that Australian conservatives fight back hard against these smears, and left-wing attempts to instrumentalize a massacre to gain political power over their opponents. It's massively important.

The Nick Riemers of Australia want to make you all ashamed of Western civilization, and to despise it. Don't let him get away with it.",221,The American Conservative,Australian Left Doesn't Waste Massacre
"Biden obtained nearly a double-digit lead in the 2020 presidential primaries, according to a Morning Consult survey.

Former Vice President Biden has 35 percent support among Democrat primary voters, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has 27 percent support, and everyone other candidate gained less than ten percent support. Biden garnered nearly four points since last week as it becomes increasingly apparent that the former vice president will run for president.

The rest of the Democrats rank:

Biden also leads in early primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. In these early primary states, Democrat voters favored Biden at 39 percent, Sanders at 28 percent, and Harris at seven percent.

The former vice president and the Vermont democratic socialist also lead in favorability among Democrat primary voters. Forty-five percent of Democrats strongly approve of Biden, 33 percent somewhat approve of former Delaware senator, while only 13 percent either somewhat or strongly disapprove of Biden.

Thirty-four percent of Democrats strongly approve of Sanders, 41 percent somewhat approve of the Vermont senator, and 15 percent strongly disapprove of Sanders.

The Morning Consult poll arises as Biden stumbled during a speech Saturday in which he suggested that he was already running for president, even though he has not yet announced his potential candidacy for president.

""I'm told I get criticized by the New Left,"" Biden said. ""I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the ... anybody who would run.""

Biden said that the 2020 election could serve as one of the most important elections in over 100 years and chastised President Donald Trump for his hardball tactics.

""Our politics have become so mean, so petty, so vicious, that we can't govern ourselves, in many cases even talk to one another,"" Biden said.

President Trump slammed Biden for his ""tongue-tied"" gaffe on Monday, calling the former vice president ""low I.Q.""

"A new Hollywood Reporter/Morning Consult poll finds that a large minority of 39 percent think that the show has gotten too political, according to Hollywood Reporter.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the split is more obvious when broken down by political party. 53 percent of Republicans said that the show is too political while 60 percent of Democrats say they do not mind the political direction of the show.

Not many viewers are fooled about the show's political leanings, either. 48 percent say the show is definitely liberal. Only a scant five percent think it is conservative while a tiny ten percent don't see any identifying political leanings.

Also, 68 percent of respondents agreed that the series constantly makes ""political statements,"" while only 9 percent thought there was no political point to the show.

It also seemed that a large number did not want to see politicians as guest hosts. 37 percent said they would not like to see a politician host the show while 32 percent said the show could be ""more entertaining"" if a politician were to be chosen as a guest host.

The split was similar on political sketches. 35 percent said the show is better without politics while 37 percent said it is ""more entertaining"" to have sketches with political themes.

Finally, an even larger minority said that they would be more likely to watch the show if it dumped the politics. 41 percent said that they would prefer jokes to be non-political while only 22 percent wanted more anti-Republican jokes. Six percent wanted more jokes slamming Democrats.

""Viewers agree with President Trump that Saturday Night Live has a liberal bias but are divided on whether the program has too many political skits,"" Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult's vice president, said with the release of the poll. ""Notably, 37 percent of Americans say the program has the right amount of politics in its sketches, while 31 percent say it has too much and 4 percent say too little. However, the results vary across partisan lines. Over half of Republicans (55 percent) say the program incorporates too much politics; only 14 percent of Democrats say the same.""

""I turned to my wife and I said, 'The Times is absolutely committed to making sure that this guy does not get elected.'""

Koppel said Trump's perception that ""the establishment press is out to get him"" is indeed accurate.

"Sanders defends Democratic socialism; reaction and analysis from Fox News contributor Jessica Tarlov and Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley.

One month after Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign is announcing major staffing decisions.

The independent senator from Vermont on Tuesday formally announced a slate of national staffers. The move comes just four days after Sanders highlighted that his presidential campaign would be the first in history to unionize. And the announcements come three weeks after a major shakeup at the campaign, with several top advisers from Sanders' 2016 White House bid heading for the exits.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCES SHAKEUP ONE WEEK AFTER LAUNCH

Among the announcements on Tuesday was that Faiz Shakir is serving as campaign manager. Shakir - who's been on the job managing the campaign for a couple of weeks - joined Sanders from the ACLU, where he served as national political director.

Shakir succeeds Jeff Weaver, who managed the senator's 2016 White House bid. It was previously announced that Weaver would serve as senior adviser on the 2020 campaign.

Rene Spellman will serve as deputy campaign manager. Spellman - who joined Sanders from Creative Artists Agency (CAA) - is a veteran of Sanders 2016 run, where she worked as national director of traveling press and media logistics

Ari Rabin-Havt will serve as the campaign's chief of staff, moving over from Sanders' Senate office. He's also a one-time senior adviser to former Vice President Al Gore and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

STITCHES FOR SANDERS AFTER CUTTING HEAD ON SHOWER DOOR

Veteran labor and grassroots organizer Analilia Mejia will serve as national political director, with Progressive Change Campaign Committee veteran Sarah Badawi serving as deputy political director.

Also being formally announced are six 2016 campaign veterans: Claire Sandberg as national organizing director, Heather Gautney as senior policy adviser, Arianna Jones as communications director, Sarah Ford as deputy communications director, Tim Tagaris as senior adviser, and Robin Curran as digital fundraising director.

Josh Orton - a senior adviser in Sanders' Senate office - was named policy director. Briahna Gray - a former attorney, columnist and senior politics editor at The Intercept - will serve as national press secretary. David Sirota - an investigative journalist - will serve as communications adviser and speechwriter. And Georgia Parke - who also worked in Sanders' Senate office - will serve as social media strategist.

Late last month, just days after Sanders launched his campaign, three of the top advisers who helped propel the senator's 2016 White House bid -- Tad Devine, Julian Mulvey and Mark Longabaugh - parted ways with the 2020 campaign.

Regardless of the shakeup, Sanders came out of the gate in strong position. He drew large crowds to his first two rallies in New York City and Chicago and along with former Vice President Joe Biden, who's likely to announce his bid next month, is near the top of the public opinion polls.

Jason Rezaian proposes adopting new terms for describing the internal divisions in the Iranian government:

It makes much more sense to classify Iranian political actors according to two types of worldview: insular or outward-looking. There are leaders who believe the Islamic republic operates best in isolation, and there are those who believe that the country needs to be more fully engaged with other countries, particularly Western ones. This is the real tension in the Iranian system.

One doesn't have to support either to understand that those are the opposing forces within the regime in Tehran.

Acknowledging this obvious distinction would go a long way in creating an atmosphere of discourse that's less emotionally charged and more conducive to solving the challenges that Iran presents.

Rezaian makes several good points, and there could be real value in rethinking the labels we use to describe the divisions in other regimes. We could probably benefit from thinking of these divisions in terms of pragmatism and ideological inflexibility as well. The officials that are most often described as relative moderates in the system are distinguished by both their ""outward-looking"" attitude and their willingness to make practical compromises. By the same token, the hard-liners are ""insular"" and rigid in their views. However we choose to name these competing forces, what matters is that we understand that they exist, their political disagreements are meaningful, and their internal competition has been and will be shaped to some extent by our government's Iran policy.

Iran hawks in the U.S. make a point of ignoring and collapsing the differences that exist between political factions in Iran because they prefer to see and talk about the regime as monolithic and unchanging. In general, our own hard-liners aren't interested in understanding what goes on inside Iran except insofar as they can exploit it to justify more aggressive policies, and because many of them support regime change they don't care about the internal politics of something they want to destroy. Because their preferred policies of isolation, sanctions, and hostility undermine the ""outward-looking"" and pragmatic forces inside the regime and bolster the ""insular"" and inflexible forces, they prefer to deny that the former really exist. If they are acknowledged at all, they are dismissed as window dressing or, as Pompeo so crudely front men for a corrupt religious mafia put it, ""front men for a corrupt religious mafia.""

Iran hawks deny the existence of relative moderates in the regime for much the same reason that they hate the nuclear deal. Just as the nuclear deal deprives them of a pretext for hostility and conflict, the existence of relative moderates in the regime makes it more difficult to portray the regime in the worst possible light in order to isolate and punish Iran. That is why they denounce a successful nonproliferation agreement as the worst deal ever made and deny the real differences that exist within the regime. They consider both to be obstacles in their effort to stoke tensions and seek confrontation with the Iranian government, and so they work to sabotage the one by reneging on the deal and to undermine the other through sanctions.",226,The American Conservative,Why Iran Hawks Don't Want to Understand Iran
"Jeffrey Hart, our longtime senior editor, and an eminent professor of English, died last month at 88. I have a piece about him on our homepage. Here on the Corner, I would like to take note of a couple of things.

Over the years, I have enjoyed asking people -- especially professors and the like -- about their favorite professors, or most influential ones. You get some interesting answers. Some of the favorites, or most influential, are famous. Some are unknown. Some were famous during their careers and no more.

Jeff spent his freshman and sophomore years at Dartmouth and his junior and senior years at Columbia. (He took a year off between the two colleges, working in publishing.) At Columbia, he had the famous triumvirate of Trilling, Barzun, and Van Doren. At Dartmouth, there had been only one professor who ""meant anything"" to him, as he put it.

That was Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. His Wikipedia entry is interesting. He was born in Berlin in 1888. Converted to Christianity in his teens. Married a woman named Margrit H√ºssy. They combined their names, which seems very modern, doesn't it? Eugen was a brilliant scholar. He was an officer in World War I. When Hitler came to power, he and Margrit high-tailed it to America.

Jeff said that Rosenstock (as he was commonly known) had ""his Existenz experience"" at Verdun: ""cut off alone in a shell crater during a French barrage."" Rosenstock became a ""Christian-Existentialist,"" as Jeff termed him. He believed in ""creative will,"" and his heroes were Nietzsche and William James.

In class, he would say things like, ""Gentlemen, if Eleazar Wheelock had not come north to this lonely place, we would not be here today."" (This was a Congregationalist minister who founded Dartmouth in 1769.) ""Gentlemen, if Columbus had not crossed the ocean ...""

Jeff had arrived at Dartmouth ""a confident naturalist,"" he once wrote to me -- and his classes with Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy ""wrecked"" this forever.

About 15 years later, he was hired as a professor at Dartmouth by John Sloan Dickey, the president of the college. Dickey had been, said Jeff, ""a Rockefeller prot√©g√© at the State Department."" Here is his Wikipedia entry. I loved reading this: ""Regularly welcoming freshmen at Convocation with the phrase 'your business here is learning,' Dickey was committed ..."" When I have a chance to talk with college students, I often say, ""Learn as much as you can. Spend your years in college soaking up all the education you possibly can. Just learn and learn. There will be time for politics and all that later."" Dickey also called the liberal arts ""the liberating arts."" I love that, too.

Anyway, my piece on Jeff is, again, here. I tell some of the story of his life, as he told it to me, and provide some glimpses into his mind. ""Independence of mind,"" he once said, ""is necessary to any good writer."" No one can call Jeff Hart dependent.

P.S. He was an excellent tennis player in his youth, a denizen of the fabled West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens (site of the U.S. Open). He had many interesting things to say about sports, and I duly quote him in my piece. (""How good is Federer?"" I once asked him.)

In fact, I have been quoting him lately on the question of Jordan vs. LeBron -- not that Jeff ever addressed it directly, to my knowledge. But he would say, ""You can't compare across eras. You can't compare Tilden to Sampras, Louis to Ali, Cobb to Brett, Jones to Nicklaus. All an athlete can do is dominate his own era. That's it. He can't do anything about the people before him or the people after him.""

LeBron James is the best athlete I have ever seen. But I think Jeff's point is solid, and I rely on it frequently.",227,nationalreview.com,Jeffrey Hart and His Times
"In an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio's WVNN on Monday, Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, discussed Democrat efforts to prevent President Donald Trump's construction of a border wall through the use of the emergency order.

Palmer said it was his view that there was indeed an emergency and added there was money available for border security. However, he accused Democrats of playing politics against the president on the issue, which he explained was the reason many Americans' security was threatened.

""This is the thing that really disturbs me,"" Palmer said. ""The Democrats are so desperate to not allow [Trump] to get a perceived victory on his signature campaign issue that they're willing to allow people to continue to die.""

""You know that that the two drugs that are biggest killers are fentanyl and heroin,"" he added. ""All the heroin comes across the southern border and almost all the fentanyl. In terms of the impact on minority communities among African-Americans - it's almost 50 percent of all the overdose deaths are fentanyl. The rockstar, Prince - you remember him? He took a Vicodin, thinking it was a Vicodin that had fentanyl in it and it killed him. They're making pills just across the border and stamping them with brand names and even numbers to make them look like the real deal, but they have fentanyl in them.""",228,Breitbart,GOP Rep Palmer: Dems 'So Desperate' to Prevent Trump from Getting a Victory 'They're Willing to Allow People to Continue to Die' | Breitbart
"The husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway blasted President Trump on Wednesday, claiming Trump has a problem with 'pathological' lying.

President Trump has ensured some awkward dinner-table conversations at the Conway household, taking direct aim Tuesday at adviser Kellyanne Conway's husband.

""A total loser!"" Trump tweeted, in response to a post from campaign manager Brad Parscale about George Conway -- who despite his wife's senior role in the administration has emerged as an outspoken Trump critic.

""We all know that @realDonaldTrump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked @TheJusticeDept and was either fired/quit, didn't want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn't even know him!"" Parscale had tweeted Monday night.

KELLYANNE CONWAY'S HUSBAND RIPS TRUMP FOR 'PATHOLOGICAL' LYING, CLAIMS PRESIDENT HAS 'DISORDER'

Conway himself responded shortly afterward, tweeting: ""Congratulations! You just guaranteed that millions of more people are going to learn about narcissistic personality disorder and malignant narcissism! Great job!""

The fiery tweets came after George Conway, who has frequently criticized Trump, questioned the president's mental health.

Conway elaborated early Monday, saying that Trump's barrage of tweets over the weekend - including critiques of the late Sen. John McCain and ""Saturday Night Live"" - were a ""product of his pathologies"" rather than a ""rational plan or strategy.""

He then retweeted a post from ""Duty To Warn,"" which tried to demonstrate that Trump's activities matched the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder.

GEORGE CONWAY RAMPS UP TRUMP ATTACKS AS KELLYANNE DEFENDS BOSS

It was the latest salvo from George Conway, who last week posted a thread that began when he called out Trump for claiming that Judge Amy Berman Jackson's sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort earlier in the day had exonerated the president from the Russian collusion narrative.

""Have we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life?"" Conway asked in a tweet. ""One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off. But instead he lies about it. He denies what the world can see on videotape. Even his donors and supporters wonder, what is wrong with him? Why would he feel compelled to tell such an absurd lie?""

The president's camp has largely avoided responding to George Conway until now, with Eric Trump one of the few to fire back.

""Of all the ugliness in politics, the utter disrespect George Conway shows toward his wife, her career, place of work, and everything she has fought SO hard to achieve, might top them all,"" Eric Trump wrote in December.

"Monday on Fox News Channel's ""The Ingraham Angle,"" HUD Secretary Ben Carson reacted to attacks on President Donald Trump proclaiming he is racist, especially in the wake of last week's mass shooting in New Zealand.

Carson batted down those accusations by relaying his own personal interactions with Trump.

""There's a narrative that's being painted there,"" Carson said. ""You know, I've had an opportunity to interact with racist people throughout my life. And [Trump] is not one. He is so easy to be around. He treats you with the utmost respect. You know, I talked with early on about the plight of many people, particularly in the inner city. And the compassion that he showed is very impressive. But you know, he doesn't wear it on his sleeve. He believes that a rising tide lifts all boats.

"CNN went to the U.S.-Mexico border and actually found-and interviewed-Latinos who support President Donald Trump and his border wall.

On Monday's Erin Burnett OutFront, CNN's Miguel Marquez noted that 34% of Latinos approved of Trump in a recent CNN poll. He said, as a puzzled Erin Burnett looked on, that though a majority of Latinos disapprove of Trump, there are plenty who live along the U.S.-Mexico border who support Trump, believe that there is a ""national emergency"" at the border, and would like to see the size of the border wall ""doubled"" or ""tripled.""

Rolando Rodriguez, who lives a mile from the border in McAllen, Texas, said he wants a 2,600-mile border wall that is ""longer and taller.""

When asked how much taller he wants the border wall to be, Rodriguez replied, ""twice as much at least.""

Rodriguez, who said he supports Trump because of religious issues and ""border politics,"" added that he believes that the border wall will be a barrier for the ""bad people"" and not the ""good people.""

CNN also found Mayra Gutierrez, who is in the process of getting her U.S. citizenship so she can vote for Trump. She said she supports Trump because of abortion, the economy, and immigration.

""We do have a lot problems here with immigration, and I do support his stance for the wall,"" Gutierrez told CNN.

Joacim Hernandez, the president of the Hidalgo County Young Republicans, told the outlet that the last time Trump visited the area, there were a lot of Latinos ""that were out there supporting him.""

Marquez's interviews were consistent with what former longtime Univision anchor Mar√≠a Elena Salinas told CNN in January about Trump's appeal among a significant number of Latinos. Salinas implied that Trump could have more support among Latinos than conventional wisdom and even polling suggests.

The legendary Spanish-language anchor whom the New York Times once described as the ""voice of Hispanic America,"" as Breitbart News noted, revealed that she was saddened that many Latinos ""are buying some of these arguments against undocumented immigrants"" that Trump has been making.

""And it's very sad to see that our own people, who are immigrants themselves, are attacking these immigrants that are trying to come in, knowing themselves how difficult the situation is in a lot of these Latin American countries,"" Salinas said then. ""And, you know, they're buying it, and some people, just like some other Trump supporters, are saying, well, you know, so what if he tells lies, as long as we have lower unemployment among the Latino community.""

Trump, who got more support among Latinos in 2016 than Mitt Romney did in 2012 when Trump received 29% of the Latino vote, has often pointed out that illegal immigration hurts Latino workers and illegal immigrant criminals victimize Hispanics who are in the country legally.

In the 2018 midterm elections, AP's VoteCast data, exit polls, and other surveys found that Republicans received about a third of the Latino vote even though the mainstream media for two years painted Trump as an anti-Latino ""racist.""

Marquez said that though a majority of Latinos disapprove of Trump and his border politics, pro-Trump Latinos believe there is enough support among the community to get Trump re-elected in 2020.",231,Breitbart,CNN Stunned to Find Pro-Trump Latinos: We Want 'Longer and Taller' Wall | Breitbart
"Over a dozen 2020 presidential hopefuls have already thrown their hats in the ring. Many more are expected to declare before the year's end. Late last week, former failed senatorial candidate Robert Francis O'Rourke, otherwise known as ""Beto,"" announced his candidacy.

The mainstream media fell in love with Beto. Do you feel like you kind of have a deja vu here? Almost like we've seen this kind of cheerleading from the supposedly unbiased mainstream media before? We did. Back in 2008, they were in love with Barack Obama, thrills up the leg and everything.

Now, this love affair persisted for eight long years and beyond. It was so bad, this program was one of the very few shows to actually do the real vetting of future president of the United States, Barack Obama. Remember, on ""Hannity,"" we showed you Obama's ties to the radical, unrepentant Weather Underground domestic terrorists, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEAN HANNITY.

We revealed the true nature of Obama's longtime pastor of 20-plus years, Jeremiah Wright, and the church of ""godd--n"" America, rooted in black liberation theology -- and Frank Marshall Davis, and ACORN, and Saul Alinsky, and community organizing.

And now, it is, once again, up to us to vet the 2020 candidates. Our predictions of a failed Obama presidency rooted in these radical views turned out to be more accurate than we would've wished for, for our country. If the media had done its job, America might have avoided that disaster. They were Obama's cheerleaders every single day, even on the ridiculous $150 billion Iranian deal.

Well, we can see history is repeating itself. For example, look at the latest controversy surrounding Reuters and Robert Francis O'Rourke. On Friday, we learned that one of their reporters sat on an embarrassing story about O'Rourke's time as a renegade for two years until after his hotly contested race with Ted Cruz. In fact, the reporter, Joseph Menn, entered into an agreement with Beto to delay his damning story, so long as O'Rourke granted him the interview.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

If it seems like the mainstream media and Democrats work together to win elections as one team, that is because they actually do. So-called journalists like Joseph Menn shield Democrats from embarrassment by spiking or delaying certain reports, all while sticking it to President Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day, no matter how shaky the story, how weak the sourcing, if there even is any sourcing.

Menn's report in Reuters has been published, and its contents are downright shocking. According to multiple outlets, as a teenager, O'Rourke helped found one of America's oldest hacking groups, called ""The Cult of the Dead Cow."" During his time in the hacking community, Beto and his online friends stole video games, stole long distance phone service for his dial-up modem, and engaged in various other hacking efforts in the 1980s. He went by the name ""Psychedelic Warlord.""

Beto also frequently posted unusual, bizarre, strange, frightening writings on group message boards, including classifying certain women as ""sluts."" ""Ultra trendies are usually the scene sluts that many menfolk admire so,"" he apparently once wrote.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.

And O'Rourke, aka Psychedelic Warlord, wrote the best way to deal with these girls was tell them that they are ugly. He also posted a violent, bizarre murder fantasy, writing, ""One day as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street and as I neared the young ones, I put all of my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of two children on the hood and the sharp cry of pain from one of the two.""

The mainstream media fell in love with Beto. Do you feel like you kind of have a deja vu here? Almost like we've seen this kind of cheerleading from the supposedly unbiased mainstream media before? We did. They were in love with Barack Obama, thrills up the leg and everything.

Pretty sick, ugly, twisted, dark story. To be fair, Robert Francis was much younger at the time of this disturbing publication. But I ask this question: I wonder if the media, the left, will follow the Kavanaugh standard for Beto O'Rourke. Remember when they pored through Justice Kavanaugh's high school yearbook, all in an attempt to disqualify him from the Supreme Court?

That's not going to happen to Beto. That is just their standard for conservatives -- there is one standard for liberals, another standard for conservatives. In fact, this report about Beto has barely made a dent in the traditional news cycle.

Over the weekend, O'Rourke offered this heartfelt apology. Naturally, in the hypersensitive Democratic Party, O'Rourke was also forced to issue several other apologies, including about a joke about his wife raising their children, and, of course, his white privilege. Here we go. Yet another weak Democrat starting with apology tours.

But there is bad news for ""Bozo"" Beto - the crowd in the Democratic field is about to get even bigger.

Over the weekend, former vice president, Crazy Uncle Joe Biden, accidentally announced his run for president. Then he took it back. This is not uncommon for him. This is the same guy who said, 'You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.' And he once referred to Barack Obama as ""clean and articulate.""

Whether or not gaffe-prone Biden actually runs for president, he's using his public status much like the Clintons to rake in millions. From six-figure speaking gigs to seven-figure book deals, Crazy Uncle Joe is turning his humble public service into a gold mine.

If he runs, Biden would be just the latest Democrat to engage in class warfare politics, all while sitting on top of a mound of cash and the worst record of any political team, him and Obama, that we've seen in our lifetime.",232,Fox News,Sean Hannity: The mainstream media falls in love with - and provides cover for - Beto O'Rourke.

"Jeffrey Hart was one of the brightest, most learned people I have ever known. He had a prodigious memory and instant recall. I never saw him search his thought. What I mean is, I never saw him strain for a fact or a name or a word. Or a quotation. Whatever it was, it was on his lips immediately.

He never said ""uh"" or anything like that. He never played for time. He never rubbed his eyes or furrowed his brow or scratched his head. Whatever he needed was there, instantly.

I heard him talk about classical literature, history in various periods, sports of many kinds -- a wide range of subjects. He was fluent in them all. He was a very rare bird.

Jeff Hart was long an editor and writer at National Review. He was also a scholar, an academic, a professor of English literature. He died last month at 88.

He was born on February 24, 1930, in New York City -- Brooklyn, to be borough-specific. This was during the presidency of Herbert Hoover, about four months after the Crash.

Jeff went to Stuyvesant High School, which he described in a letter to me as ""the jewel of the NYC system."" He further said this: ""Stuyvesant, now mostly Asian, was then mostly Jewish, Trotskyite, and chess-playing, and so competitive it would have made George Steinbrenner look like a Zen Buddhist.""

Steinbrenner, you recall, was the owner of the New York Yankees for about 40 years, from 1973 onward.

Jeff said something else about Stuyvesant, which amuses me on several counts: ""My Jewish friends there interested me in Wagner and Marx, but failed with chess.""

When it came time for college, Jeff went to Dartmouth, although ""almost everyone I knew at Stuyvesant went to Harvard to become a doctor."" Jeff too was pre-med. By the way, his dad was a Dartmouth alum and, according to Jeff, had him wired for Dartmouth pretty much from birth.

""Entering in 1947,"" Jeff said, ""I found Dartmouth impossibly dull, collegiate in the worst sense, hazing and all that. The professors were not nearly as challenging as the teachers at Stuyvesant. The Dartmouth professors could easily have been taken for tweedy instructors at Andover or some such place.""

Now we will meet an exceptional professor, courtesy of Jeff:

The professor at Dartmouth who meant anything at all to me was a refugee Christian-Existentialist named Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. Not surprisingly, Tillich and Auden thought well of him. I notice that George Morgan mentions him in his famous 1941 study of Nietzsche, probably the best in English on the subject.

Jeff painted a little picture of his professor:

Half-Jewish, looking like a Prussian officer, Rosenstock had fought at Verdun, where he had his Existenz experience, cut off alone in a shell crater during a French barrage. There he experienced total meaninglessness. His master phrase was ""History must be told."" He wrecked my confident naturalism, showing that risk-taking acted on little or no evidence, and that without risk-taking there could be nothing: Back in the crater, one created.

Naturalism is not something you hear much about these days. It has definitions in literature, philosophy, and theology. Jeff knew them all, for sure. Here is a definition in the philosophical category: ""the view of the world that takes account only of natural elements and forces, excluding the supernatural or spiritual.""

So, how did Rosenstock teach? How would his view of the world express itself? He would say things like, ""Gentlemen, if Eleazar Wheelock had not come north to this lonely place, we would not be here today."" ""Gentlemen, if Columbus had not ..."" (Wheelock was the Congregationalist minister who founded Dartmouth College in 1769.)

""Eugen's heroes,"" said Jeff, ""were Nietzsche and William James: creative will.""

Jeff took all of Rosenstock's courses. Then ""I decided that I could get no more out of this prep-schoolish place, packed up, went back to NYC, and got a job with a publisher, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, as a very minor editor. I figured I would stay in publishing, write, maybe go to Time, whatever.""

Obviously, a medical career had gone by the boards. The young man was besotted with the humanities, especially literature. In due course, ""I was persuaded by some Columbia junior professors to give Columbia a chance. So I did, having read Trilling and Van Doren, at least. The Liberal Imagination was just out, and I saw how important that was.""

The Liberal Imagination was a collection of essays by Lionel Trilling, published in 1950.

You may wonder why Jeff Hart was writing me all this. Had I asked him about his life? No -- I had said that I had attended a concert at Columbia. And this reminded me of him. I must have said that I associated him more with Columbia than with Dartmouth (even though he had spent the bulk of his career at Dartmouth), because he began his letter to me,

You are even more correct than you could know in associating me with Columbia rather than Dartmouth. But that has been a ""complex fate,"" to use a Henry James phrase. And it leads me to some Proustian reflections on things past, at what will be somewhat Proustian length, unfortunately.

I did not mind one bit. It is a rich, marvelous letter. I felt privileged to receive it, and I still do.

Jeff indeed enrolled at Columbia, studying under Trilling, Mark van Doren, and Jacques Barzun. He earned his B.A. in '52. Then he enlisted in the Navy, during this time of the Korean War. He worked for ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence.

But I have not yet said anything about tennis. Jeff was a very good tennis player, a top junior and collegian. He played No. 1 on the Dartmouth team and No. 1 on the Columbia team. He had learned to play at the fabled West Side Tennis Club, in Forest Hills, Queens. The club hosted the U.S. Open (as the tournament would come to be called) from 1915 to 1977, with a few years' hiatus. Young Jeff hit balls with the pros, warming them up.

In 2012, I asked him about Roger Federer. Jeff wrote, ""Federer is wonderful. He ranks among the all-time greats. The excellence of his form makes the racket do the job and saves his body."" That is a shrewd observation, applicable to other sports as well, and to musical activities, too: singing, for example.

Yes, Jeff ranked Federer among the greats. ""But Tilden's serve was 163 mph WITH A WOODEN RACKET. He won seven U.S. championships. I would say Tilden 1, Budge 2."" (We are talking about Bill Tilden and Don Budge.)

Jeff was willing to do some ranking there, obviously. But he also told me something else that has stayed with me, and that I have repeated many times. In a conversation one day, he said something like this: ""You cannot really compare across eras: Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali, Ty Cobb and George Brett, Bobby Jones and Jack Nicklaus, Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan. All an athlete can do is dominate his own era. That's all he can do. He can't do anything about the people who have come before him and the people who will come after him.""

Okay. You remember that Jeff was in naval intelligence.

In 1956, stationed in Boston with ONI and chasing security risks, but living in Cambridge, I got to know some of the Harvard English professors, especially Harry Levin, another interesting story, and even then had begun to publish. It was clear that I could have had a junior post at Harvard; but after much thought, wandering around the quadrangles and watching the crews work out on the Charles, I went back to Columbia.

On Jeff's first day back, Lionel Trilling hired him as an assistant professor. ""There was of course a nominal chairman,"" Jeff recounted, ""but Lionel did about what he wanted.""

He told me two stories about Jacques Barzun. I have always loved the first, and have shared it with many others. I would say that it has actually had an effect on me. Here goes, as told by Jeff in this ""Proustian"" letter:

One day, I had an appointment with Jacques to discuss my graduate-school ambitions. I was ten minutes late because students kept me in class arguing and asking questions. When I showed up, Barzun was sitting behind a large desk in an office the size of Mussolini's. It seemed miles before I got to his desk. He said, ""Professor Hart. Apparently you think your time more valuable than mine."" Since then I have never been late for an appointment.

Okay -- here is the second story:

He asked me in for a discussion about my dissertation topic. All went smoothly until he said, ""Professor Hart, remember, you must not take more than one year to write your dissertation."" And then, ""Of course you know that it must be published."" I did not disappoint him.

As the great Harvard Shakespeare scholar George Lyman Kittredge said when he was accused of flunking too many Ph.D. candidates on their orals, ""Standards must be kept up.""

Let me take a detour, for a quick second: I once interviewed Elliott Carter, the composer, on the eve of his hundredth birthday. This was in 2008. He had studied English at Harvard with, among others, Irving Babbitt and Kittredge. The latter was ""a tyrant,"" said Carter. ""I mean, everybody went there -- he always had a full classroom -- and if anybody sneezed or coughed, he'd say, 'You get out of here!' So we all sat in terror.""

Now, back to Jeff:

In 1962 I got a perfect score on the 200-question pre-oral exam. This was the second perfect score since World War II. Then a First on the orals, which were public, and for me just a bright conversation in which they tried to stump me with tricky questions. I remember the tricks still.

Barzun seemed satisfied, has followed my activities, and we correspond.

Musing to me about Columbia, Jeff quoted Barzun: ""Columbia has the soul of General Motors."" I will keep quoting -- Jeff, that is:

Lionel Trilling put it a different way, saying, ""Columbia is not alma mater. Columbia is dura mater."" Yet he turned down countless offers from Harvard.

In that way -- its dura-mater-ism -- Columbia more resembles the University of Chicago than it does Princeton.

Much as Jeff loved Columbia, he decided to go teach at Dartmouth. (He also had offers from Berkeley and Virginia.) Jeff said this, in his letter to me:

In 1963, John Sloan Dickey, a Rockefeller prot√©g√© from the State Department and then Dartmouth president, was trying to build a decent faculty; he offered enticements to some good people for a new Dartmouth English department; and Dartmouth offered me a choice deal. So I was back at Dartmouth. Small world.

Jeff went on to say that ""poor Dickey was ruined by the faculty for having student protesters arrested for occupying his office. Think of that. A sensible citizen-like thing to do. This made him unable to run the place, and he retired early.""

Professor Hart taught at Dartmouth from 1963 until his own retirement in 1993. His main fields (I believe) were 18th-century England and the American moderns: Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Pound, et al. I once asked Jeff, ""Is Hemingway overrated?"" (I had the feeling he was -- that people were enraptured by the persona.) Jeff said, ""No, underrated.""

Jeff was very popular at Dartmouth, sometimes speaking to overflow crowds. He was knowledgeable, of course, and entertaining, and -- this must have counted for a lot -- utterly free of political correctness.

He once told me something amazing. For a period of years, everyone at Dartmouth was stoned. Drugged. (Of course, it was this way everywhere.) Jeff was facing a classroom of zombies. ""We might as well have suspended teaching for that entire period, until they sobered up.""

I don't think I've yet mentioned anything about Jeff and politics. In 1968, Governor Reagan of California ran for president, sort of. Jeff did some speechwriting for him. He also wrote speeches for the eventual nominee, Nixon, and continued this service for the early part of the new administration.

Jeff was an excellent writer -- search him out! -- believing in simple, direct communication. He knew a lot -- a helluva lot -- and he probably knew as many words as anybody. But he believed in that simple, direct writing.

Before we leave the subject of Nixon, I want to share something with you. Years ago -- in 2002 -- I was writing an essay about an interesting subject: the honorific ""Dr."" This is a very, very touchy subject in America. I got some information from Jeff, which I incorporated into my piece:

Feelings about ""Dr."" are bound up in that bitch-goddess, Status. (Yes, I know: James said Success. But Status is a sister.) The best line in either Austin Powers movie belongs to Dr. Evil, who, when addressed as ""Mr.,"" says, ""I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'Mr.,' thank you very much!"" Our senior editor Jeffrey Hart, professor emeritus of English at Dartmouth, remembers serving as a campaign adviser to Nixon (not that this is necessarily a segue from evil). To Jeff's amusement, Nixon called him ""Dr. Hart."" This accords with the Nixon we know: class-conscious, status-nervous, chip-on-the-shouldery, the boy from Whittier who received a tuition scholarship to Harvard but couldn't go, because the family didn't have the money to transport him to and from Massachusetts. Nixon, according to Jeff, would also say, ""I'm no Ph.D., but ...,"" before launching into a disquisition on some arcane topic.

Back to Jeff and his academic career. Reminiscing, he said,

Over the years, while at Dartmouth, I received a lot of offers from my publication [i.e., on account of his published writings], but I never would leave the Ivy League. What proved this to me was that I twice turned down an endowed chair at Vanderbilt, despite the ghosts of Ransom and the Fugitives there.

Note, please, that Jeff had a statement affixed to the bottom of his stationery. It was a statement from John Crowe Ransom, to wit, ""In manners, aristocratic; in religion, ritualistic; in art, traditional."" This is a distinct kind of conservatism.

Back to the letter I was quoting:

No other places outside the Ivy League seemed quite real to me, certainly not California, eucalyptus land. Starting when I was about five, my father took me to the Dartmouth-Princeton game in Palmer Stadium. ... Dartmouth had beaten Princeton in, I think, 1916, in the first game ever at Palmer, Dartmouth winning with a ""trick play,"" the New York Times reported, and despite the exertions of Hobey Baker, who died as a flyer in France. In 1917, he flew his squadron over Palmer Stadium at halftime, the tiger logo on the fuselages. The only man in both the football and the hockey halls of fame.

That first game, according to the all-knowing Internet, was in 1914. A word about halls of fame, too: Baker is in the hockey hall and the college-football hall. He is indeed the only man in both.

I will get off the theme of colleges in a minute, but, before I do, I must quote Jeff on Harvard -- this is darned interesting, I think:

The great thing about Harvard has always been that it has never cared what a professor's after-work opinions are, as long as he is the best in his field. He could admire Pol Pot, for whatever reason, as long as he is number one in Egyptology or something. Arthur Darby Nock was the leading 20th-century St. Paul scholar and crazy as a bedbug. ...

Conservatives today do not understand Harvard, because they see it from the outside. Harvard always rights its ship. It could not possibly let its law school go too far left; Harvard heard from the major law firms that they could not use its graduates; Harvard brought in a tough new dean with orders to clean up the playpen. Which he did.

Jeffrey Hart worked at National Review, in the coterie around Bill Buckley, for many years. You can imagine how useful someone of his skills -- and spirit -- was. WFB valued him highly. Eventually -- in the 2000s -- Jeff had a sharp departure from the conservative movement and the Republican party. I will recollect a few things.

He thought that the Religious Right weighed too heavily on the movement and the party. He was also uncomfortable with southernization, as he saw it. He had very little use for the Confederacy -- and I'm putting it as mildly as possible. He was disgusted at Confederacy nostalgia. He was a ""Party of Lincoln"" kind of Republican. (This, despite his regard for Ransom and the Fugitives. Jeff's mind allowed for many things, as good minds do.) He thought that the Right, in general, gave short shrift to science. He was also conscious of environmentalism, linking conservatism to conservation.

The biggest issue, however, was foreign policy. His opposition to the Iraq War was very hot, and he voted for John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama thereafter, twice. He had extremely disparaging things to say about Sarah Palin. As for the 2016 election, the New York Times said he was ""too ill to vote.""

By the way, the headline over the Times's obit was very good, using the phrase ""influential and iconoclastic conservative."" I would add the word ""brilliant.""

After Jeff left NR, I would write him occasionally, and it usually worked like this: I would send him some short e-mail, on a subject or subjects apart from contemporary politics. And he would send back a long typewritten letter. He would write about anything and everything. His expertise seemed to know no bounds. When I mentioned the Low Library at Columbia, venue of a concert, he wrote paragraphs about architecture on college campuses. Like he was an architectural historian.

(His father was an architect. That must have helped.)

Somewhere along the line, I must have said something about Jefferson. (I don't have my original e-mail.) I got pages and pages about Jefferson -- erudite, offbeat, engrossing. Jeff begins, ""Jefferson may be the most interesting, precisely because he is often so contradictory, among the in fact 'greatest generation.'"" You understand that phrase ""the in fact 'greatest generation'"": The World War II generation, in recent years, had been labeled ""The Greatest Generation."" Jeff cared a lot about the Declaration of Independence and a lot about freedom -- ordered liberty.

Let me quote some more from that letter on Jefferson. He uses a word I had never seen before and have not seen since: ""dysphemize."" It comes from ""dysphemism,"" which means -- here I will quote a dictionary -- ""the substitution of a harsh, disparaging, or unpleasant expression for a more neutral one."" Anyway, Jeff said,

The present-day attacks on Jefferson are part of the pathology of dysphemizing America's heroes and its past on behalf of a variety of interests. All the more reprehensibly are such dysphemizers rewarded by the general culture. The claim that Lincoln was a homosexual gets more attention than his Second Inaugural, even though he did write the Second Inaugural and was not a homosexual.

Another time, he was discussing the age-old question ""Who is a Jew?"" If you convert to Christianity, are you a Jew still? This is a complicated, unending, and personal question. But Jeff hit the bull's-eye with this remark: ""If Goldwater had been German, I doubt he could have been saved by pleading Episcopalianism.""

He would sometimes write memos -- long ones -- on articles in National Review. Whole issues of the magazine. I'm looking at such a memorandum now. Sweeping, pointed, bracing stuff on democracy, same-sex marriage, Christianity, and more. What shall I quote? I've already quoted so much. How about this?

I loved Jada Pinkett Smith, the young woman who said, ""You can have everything."" There is little that wealth, talent, beauty, and youth cannot believe. As William Hazlitt said in the first sentence of his essay ""On the Feeling of Immortality in Early Youth,"" ""No young man believes he will ever die."" Hemingway used that as the final sentence about Nick Adams' innocence in the very early story ""Indian Camp.""

But as Nick Adams soon learns, it is precisely mortality that limits choice. If a person lived forever, everything might be possible. But finiteness imposes choice, all too often choice between things equally good, and that choice has a touch of tragedy about it. You cannot be a quantum physicist, a master violinist, and a Supreme Court Justice. Jada Pinkett Smith will find out, and pretty soon.

I'd like to give you one more thing -- just a sentence, even a fragment of a sentence. In 2012, Jeff had a book come out: The Living Moment: Modernism in a Broken World. In a note to me, he said that the book had received ""a favorable -- though incompetent -- review"" in a certain publication. That was so Jeff -- so, so Jeffrey Hart. Most authors would find a negative review incompetent and a favorable review competent, no matter what. But such was Jeff's mind that he could say that a favorable review -- and a helpful one -- was nonetheless incompetent.

He was a rare bird, one of the rarest. I have enjoyed getting to know him again, so to speak, in putting together this article for you.",233,nationalreview.com,The Extraordinary Jeffrey Hart
"Higher-ed institutions have long ignored merit and squelched freedom, all while failing to educate.

A number of liberal bastions are daily being hammered -- especially the elite university and Silicon Valley.

A Yale and a Stanford, or Facebook and Google, assume -- for the most part rightly -- that each is so loudly progressive that the public, federal and state regulators, and politicians would of course turn a blind eye to anything questionable that these social-justice institutions did.

And they have done a lot of quite questionable things -- cynically (and in medieval fashion) using their progressive veneer to exempt themselves from the consequences of their actions, so that they may do what otherwise would earn scrutiny and worse for most other American institutions.

Our nation's marquee universities, such as Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown -- with dozens more no doubt to be named -- recently got caught selling admittances. Or rather a few of their employees somehow freelanced under administration noses and sold entrances for cash. That is apparently our modern version of crooked 14th-century clerics putting out to bid penances to thieves and fornicators who wished to buy their way into heaven.

At some of our ""best"" universities, renegade coaches in minor sports took bribes in exchange for lies claiming that otherwise likely unqualified students were actually ""athletes"" and thereby could be greased into their colleges by middlemen who helped doctor r√©sum√©s and test scores.

The irony is rich. The offenders were not the children in Dayton or Great Falls of Hillary Clinton's ""deplorables"" and ""irredeemables,"" or of the late John McCain's ""crazies,"" or of Barack Obama's ""clingers"" -- it was not they who were using their ""white privilege"" to break the law as they virtue-signaled their racialist disdain of the working classes (who were without white privilege). What a strange psychological mechanism: Wealthy white liberals apparently squared the circle of their own private and insider privilege by fobbing ""white privilege"" off on those who don't have it -- as they used their privilege cynically for their own children.

This fraud was also the logical, if extreme, expression of university admissions systems. Universities rarely disclose exactly how they select students for admission -- despite the fact that even private colleges and universities are supposed to be publicly accountable and transparent, given that they receive billions of dollars in taxpayer grant money and benefit from federally guaranteed student loans.

The reason the pay-for-play fraud went on so long, and will likely soon grow to encompass more coaches and universities, is that schools, using a variety of euphemisms, have long ignored merit. Their doctrine apparently suggested to the less-than-ethical that everyone was finding some sort of edge and that therefore there would be little liability in doing the same.

After all, is this growing scandal of doctored r√©sum√©s and phony documents all that much worse than turning down a better qualified applicant, with far higher test scores and grades, because he is of the wrong race? Is it worse than quietly and without a peep accepting a rich kid over a welder's son in Bakersfield with better credentials because the former's dad gave millions to the university -- an institution loudly committed to equality, social justice, and dethroning ""privilege""?

The admissions scandal follows a growing pattern of questionable behavior on the part of our universities. For all practical purposes, campuses have decided that in order to advance their own politicized agendas, their unwoke students, guests, or occasional conservative faculty don't really need the protection of the U.S. Constitution.

Question the doctrine of radical policy changes meant to accommodate global warming, doubt that sexuality is socially rather biologically constructed, abhor partial-birth abortion and infanticide, or object that race-based admissions violate the spirit of equality under the law -- and you are likely to face disruptions, protests, and verbal or even physical violence, with the wink and nod or appeasement of a terrified college administration.

Accuse someone of sexual harassment, and you will quickly learn there is not much left of the Fifth Amendment and due process on campuses. Gone also is the idea of the right to face your accuser, to cross-examine witnesses, to produce evidence on your behalf, and, most significantly, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty -- the cornerstone of American and Western jurisprudence.

Then we come to the national crisis of $1.5 trillion in aggregate student-loan debt. For years, higher education has upped the costs of tuition and room and board above the annual rate of inflation to accommodate administrative bloat, an epidemic of non-teaching therapeutic facilitators and political commissars, and reduced faculty teaching loads.

Leftists are eager to insist for others on consumer-protection regulation, truth in lending, and contractual disclosure to apprise debtors of their interest obligations and long-term debt liability. Yet universities never fully apprise in-hock students exactly of the dangers of accruing too much debt each semester, of how long it will take them to pay it back, and of the average compensations after graduation that particular university degrees might likely warrant. How ironic that those who so often virtue-signal their concern for consumers offer less disclosure and fewer contractual warnings to their student debtors than used-car buyers receive from dealers.

The Trump administration is making noises about conditioning federal funding to higher education on protection of free speech for students, guests, and faculty on campuses. It is considering making universities partially responsible for defaulted student loans that they so often push down the throats of 18-year-old students through ""student aid packages"" and the hints that the U.S. taxpayer will always cover the bill if a graduate with an expensive but otherwise unmarketable degree cannot pay the federal government back for what he paid out to universities with sizable endowments.

A reckoning is on the horizon. If universities are overtly political and have one set of standards for left-wing faculty and guests and another for non-progressives, why are they tax-exempt? And why are huge donations to multi-billion-dollar endowments still tax write-offs? Why are there part-time helot faculty who teach the same classes as tenured professors and yet make a fraction of the latter's salary -- in a progressive institution whose elites hector others on our culture's neglect of equality and social justice?

Oddly, the best reform would simply to be to force universities and colleges to offer the same sort of exit exams as the admission exams they insist on for entering students. In other words, to earn a bachelor's degree, graduating college seniors would be required to taking a national standardized test to ensure minimal competence in verbal and math skills. This would certify that the four- to eight-year undergraduate experience has led to at least minimal knowledge -- much as welders or carpenters must show minimal competency to be licensed or to advance into union apprenticeships. Again, how ironic that the Obama administration once went after for-profit trade schools and colleges on grounds that their job-placement record was wanting, when supposedly nonprofit colleges (which are actually quite profitable for those in their administrative hierarchies) have a dismal record of ensuring that their graduates leave with basic language and computational skills.

Colleges demand that graduating high-school seniors take the SAT or ACT to prove that particular high-school diplomas ensure minimal competence. How odd again, then, that colleges would never regulate themselves in this way. The public might discover that the current college curriculum is mostly therapeutic and flooded with -studies courses that drown out traditional history, literature, languages, science, and math. College graduates therefore often read, write, argue, and compute in no better fashion than they once did in high school.

Something in this country went radically wrong in the 1980s and 1990s. We created an entire subversive ideology according to which loud allegiance to ""progressivism"" -- decrying class, race, and gender ""inequality"" -- excused an institution or industry from bias, exempted it from following the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution, and made competency in its mission of educating youth irrelevant. And worse still, so-called progressive egalitarians transformed the idea of an elite college degree from a reflection of wide reading, inductive thinking, and scientific and mathematical literacy into a mere cattle brand, a showy trademark that advertised social-justice virtue and provided entr√©e into the well-paying capitalist rat race.

Yet once politics serves as such a blanket exemption for institutions, then it's no surprise that the institutions ignore or even normalize fraud, racial and class discrimination, and consumer misinformation.

The rationale of contemporary higher education is that such progressive angels surely cannot be self-interested devils.",234,nationalreview.com,Withered Ivy | National Review
"We close our series on the new Roberts Court and restoration of the Constitution's original understanding with the issue most distant from the Framing: the rise of a new high-tech world. We now hold the equivalent of yesterday's supercomputers in our pockets. Communications occur instantly, from encrypted messages to Twitter blasts that reach millions. Entrepreneurs make fortunes by analyzing and harvesting the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data produced each day. Governments search the data to find terrorist networks or launch foreign propaganda. From business to politics, success depends on reading the tea leaves we electronically leave behind with social-media posts, texts and emails, or Google searches.

As inevitably as the weather, the hand of regulation has followed. While using the data for itself, the state seeks to regulate the businesses and individuals that create it. We have only begun to figure out whether the rules of privacy that governed paper records, telephone calls, and the mails will continue to apply, and how, to emails, texts, video clips, and social media. Not only does technology create more data that individuals want to protect; it also expands the government's ability to search and manipulate. Where the line will fall between new technologies, regulation, and privacy will likely become the greatest legacy of Chief Justice John Roberts's Supreme Court.

The Court will have the opportunity to correct the mistakes of its past. In the 1950s and '60s, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren sought to adapt constitutional rules to electronic technologies such as the telephone. The liberal Warren Court ignored the Bill of Rights' text and original meaning as part of a broader effort to remake the criminal procedure of the Constitution in its own image. We may again be facing a similar revolution, not out of fear of police and prosecutors, but out of unfounded worries about a Big Brother government. How the Roberts Court handles these coming issues will reveal much about how originalist the Court actually is.

In an ideal world, we might expect the political process to make the fundamental choices about the balance between privacy, government power, and the new communication and information technologies. But ever since the Warren Court, the Supreme Court has claimed that the Fourth Amendment gives it a right to set the rules. The text of the Fourth Amendment states:

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Scholars and judges generally agree that the Framers of the Fourth Amendment sought to prevent general warrants, which officers of the British Crown had used to search American colonists at any time, for any reason. But during the Warren years, the Justices transformed this ban into a requirement that the government could not conduct a constitutional search without a Fourth Amendment warrant based on probable cause, with a specific description of the persons and places to be searched. In Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the Warren Court extended the notorious exclusionary rule, which excludes from trial any evidence gathered in violation of the Fourth Amendment to all courtrooms throughout the nation. As even the liberal justice Benjamin Cardozo had complained as early as 1926, ""the criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.""

This general rule flies in the face of the text of the Fourth Amendment. Instead of assuming that only searches with warrants satisfy the Constitution, we ought to understand the amendment as composed of two parts: the search-and-seizures clause and the warrants clause. The text of the amendment fundamentally requires reasonable searches. If a search or seizure were reasonable, in the ordinary meaning of the word, then it would be legal, regardless of whether a specific warrant had been issued. Why then the warrant requirement? Such a requirement makes sense if the Framers considered search or seizure supported by a specific, judge-issued warrant to be per se reasonable. A warrant protected constables from lawsuits that, while more common during the Founding, have largely disappeared because of the Court's immunity doctrines. The amendment recognizes two paths to reasonable, and thus legal, searches and seizures.

To be sure, some originalists defend the Warren Court, in part. They observe that the Pennsylvania and Massachusetts state constitutions contained nearly identical language, with one minor but clarifying difference: The relationship between the two clauses was not an ""and"" but a ""therefore."" This difference would suggest that a specific warrant and reasonableness were one and the same. Further, according to this view, ""unreasonable"" meant against reason, which meant against the common law. And under the common law at the Founding, a warrant was necessary for a search or seizure unless law enforcement caught someone in the act of committing a felony.

Even if this reading of the Fourth Amendment were correct, the Warren Court made no attempt to base its policymaking on the amendment's original meaning. Instead, it eagerly sought to impose a regime of judicial supervision over virtually all government searches, even over technologies that would have appeared to be magic to the Framers. No case exemplifies the Court's approach better than Katz v. United States (1967). In Katz, the Warren Court found that the Fourth Amendment required a warrant to allow the police to place a listening device in a public phone booth. The defendant had used the phone in a public place outside his house, and his call was electronically intangible -- the Fourth Amendment protects only tangible things: ""persons, houses, papers, and effects."" But the Court found that his conversation fell within a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" that was recognized by society. Rather than allowing Congress and the states to decide how much protection to give phone calls or any other electronic means of communication, the justices took for themselves the power to decide what would qualify as privacy.

As they did in other areas we have already examined, the justices assumed the roles of philosopher-kings. How do courts know that society views an expectation of privacy as objectively reasonable? According to Katz, they just do. How will courts determine what society thinks? Opinion polls? And why does the Fourth Amendment expand or contract depending on what society thinks should be private? Katz's definition of privacy fails not only because judges cannot determine society's view on privacy (that is, after all, the job of legislatures), but because it is utterly circular. Instead of providing any certainty with clear rules, the federal courts turned themselves into the arbiters of privacy, the definers of the legal scope of every new technology, and the monitors of all police investigations.

Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and majorities formed by Reagan and Bush judges, the Supreme Court tried to pare back the Warren Court's activism. The Rehnquist Court created exceptions for searches conducted under exigent circumstances (such as evidence found while pursuing fleeing felons or protecting the lives of others), in good faith (such as operating under a defective warrant), at random (such as random drug-testing and drunk-driver checkpoints), or in plain view (public spaces, observation on the street). In these decisions, the Rehnquist Court began to recognize that while searches with a warrant were reasonable, not all reasonable searches need a warrant. Some observers believed that the Rehnquist Court might even overturn the exclusionary rule or Katz, but it never took that controversial step.

One of the chief surprises of the Roberts Court is that the justices have turned away from their predecessors' project of restoring reasonableness as the constitutional touchstone. When faced with the new technologies, a majority of justices have ignored the original understanding of the Fourth Amendment and reverted to the Warren Court's free-floating approach to privacy and government search. They have placed significant restrictions on the government's use of new technology for policing and anti-terrorism operations, even as foreign nations escalate their use of cyber weapons to steal valuable data (such as the security and background files of almost every federal employee), hack infrastructure, and interfere with elections. The Court has precipitously plunged into the complexities of technology and privacy, where its competence is not high, instead of allowing the people's elected representatives to make the fundamental choices.

The early signs of this high-tech activism first emerged under the Rehnquist Court. In Kyllo v. United States (2001), the Court confronted a case where a Department of Interior officer had used a new technology to search for indoor marijuana growers. The officer used a thermal imaging device that could measure the heat emitted by a building, but did not allow agents to see or listen to the activity within the house. In an opinion written by Justice Scalia, an unusual majority composed of Clarence Thomas, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer held that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the search, even though past opinions had found that evidence in plain view or in public outside the home did not require a warrant before search. ""We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical 'intrusion into a constitutionally protected area,'"" Scalia wrote, ""constitutes a search at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use."" According to the majority, ""this assures preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted."" The dissent properly observed that the officer observed something outside the house, much as an officer might hear screams coming from within or witness smoke pouring from a window. But unfortunately, the Court thought it should set the standard for advanced sensor technology, rather than allowing the elected branches to decide -- either Congress through legislation or the executive branch via regulation.

Despite its conservative reputation, the Roberts Court picked up where the Rehnquist Court's Kyllo decision left off. In United States v. Jones (2012), the Court addressed police use of a device that used the Global Positioning System to track a car's movements. Without getting a warrant, Washington, D.C., police attached a device to a suspected drug dealer's Jeep that reported its movements 24 hours a day for a month. Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia held that the placement of the device constituted a physical invasion of the car. All of the justices agreed that the GPS monitoring device violated the Fourth Amendment, though some justices believed that shorter time periods might satisfy the Constitution. But the Court's decision did not persuasively address why the GPS device amounted to an illegal search, while the exact same work conducted by human beings - having police officers conduct round-the-clock surveillance - would not violate the Constitution. In both cases, the tracker or the police officer simply follows the public movements of a suspect's car. The tracking device only saves time and resources, and even intrudes less on privacy because it would observe only the location of the car and not what happened inside. The Court's approach only invites more intrusive surveillance, such as deploying an aerial drone, which would never come into physical contact with the car, or even need to use enhanced sensors, to follow a suspect and report its movements instead. It is difficult to believe that the justices would forbid the police the use of night vision, in the way they forbade GPS, in public places to pursue fleeing felons. Police could simply follow a car when it travels on public roads and record video of its movements in real time.

The Roberts Court's most recent opinion, Carpenter v. United States (2018), might prove its most sweeping. In a 5-4 decision, the chief justice joined the Court's four liberals in finding that a person had an expectation of privacy in records kept by a telephone company of his cellphone's location. Dissenting Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch argued that the third-party exception to the Fourth Amendment meant no warrant was required. Under existing doctrine, and the plain text of the amendment, individuals lose their claim to privacy over records or information that they willingly hand over to a third party. Upon this understanding, the Court has allowed warrantless searches such as ""pen registers,"" which record dialed telephone numbers, and for business records such as credit-card and financial transactions, because the original owner voluntarily gave the information to someone else. In this case, the owner of the cellphone allows the device to constantly ""ping"" the wireless cellphone network, which notifies the telephone company of its location. Police used the information to show that the suspects -- who had, ironically, sought to rob cellphone stores -- were present at the time and place of a series of crimes.

Nevertheless, the Court held that such nonprivate information received the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The Court did not find that the means to gather the information violated the text of the Constitution, but that somehow the data violated the Fourth Amendment because the government had come to have too much information. Chief Justice Roberts concluded that such commercial records still fell within the suspect's ""anticipation of privacy in his physical location"" because ""the time-stamped data provides an intimate window into a person's life,"" not just now, but well into the past. The problem with Chief Justice Roberts's approach is that it provides no clear rule about how much information is too much information for the government to have, how courts and police are to decide, or why the Fourth Amendment even places limits on how much knowledge the government can have about its citizens' public activities. Chief Justice Roberts, for example, might believe that the Fourth Amendment would bar government agencies from examining social media, even though individuals choose to blog and post so that many people can see, or financial data, which we transmit to banks and companies. He inevitably ""invites courts to make judgments about policy, not law,"" as Justice Thomas wrote in dissent.

These cases demonstrate that the Court, though now composed of a conservative majority appointed by Republican presidents, may still drift in a liberal direction. It is most likely to do so when, as here, it leaves behind the constitutional text and history in favor of judgments -- no matter how reasonable or popular -- that fall within the province of the elected branches of government. Technological advances will continue to pressure the Court to get creative with the Constitution over the intersection of privacy and law enforcement. So the justices have a choice. They can tread the constitutionally dubious path laid out by the Warren Court and invent whatever doctrine or test they think will be optimal from a policy perspective, per Katz and Carpenter.

Or they can leave that to the nation's policymakers: Congress and the president. There is precedent for the elected branches making decisions related to the intersection of privacy and law enforcement. In 1968, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, in part as a response to Katz, which was handed down just a year earlier. The act allowed the institution best able to weigh the competing policy interests of privacy and safety -- the legislature -- to make the balancing determination. The Constitution's federal structure also encourages states to experiment with different balances of privacy and security. Of course, the text and history of the Constitution provide a floor. But if society wishes to provide greater protection for privacy at the cost of some security, it should make that decision through the same political process that it uses for other public policies.

As technological development continues to accelerate, the Court will have a decision to make. Will it usurp the authority of the people and their representatives to decide how to best move forward in this new world, or will it succumb to the temptation of playing platonic guardians who know better how to navigate the future? Time will tell which path the Court chooses, but the Constitution has an answer, if they choose to consult it.",235,nationalreview.com,Technology and the Fourth Amendment | National Review
"Finally, the left has found a reason to criticize Beto O'Rourke.

Kicking off his presidential campaign in Iowa last week, the former congressman from Texas, who was last seen losing a Senate race, told a small group of supporters that his wife ""is raising, sometimes with my help,"" their children.

His tone was apparently self-deprecating, but as the New York Times reported, some on the left saw this as an expression of his white male privilege. And it aggravated concerns elicited by his campaign video, in which his wife sat by his side and smiled lovingly at him, never saying a word.

GUTFELD ON BETO'S APOLOGY

O'Rourke quickly apologized for his characterization of himself as a detached father. ""I think the criticism is right on,"" he said the next day. ""My ham-handed attempt to try to highlight the fact that Amy has the lion's share of the burden in our family - that she actually works but is the primary parent in our family, especially when I served in Congress, especially when I was on the campaign trail - should have also been a moment for me to acknowledge that that is far too often the case, not just in politics, but just in life in general.""

I am unsure what set them off. Was the problem that he was bragging about spending a couple of years on a failed U.S. Senate campaign, followed by a foolish road trip building his social media following? Or was it that he has indeed been a largely absent father for a couple of years? Either of these facts would be enough to decimate a woman's campaign, and that bugs them too.

The usual cries of ""white male privilege"" and O'Rourke's almost ritualistic admission of guilt make it easy to dismiss the issue as just another example of social justice warriors and the radical left overreacting with criticisms of every little thing any public figure says. But although I'm generally inclined to defend people who are under attack from the ""PC police,"" I think O'Rourke's liberal critics have a fair point.

His distant parenting may not be that different from many fathers a generation or two ago, but today we expect more from fathers, and for good reason. Study after study has proven that children thrive when fathers are active in their lives.

This is a hard subject because dads are sometimes absent due to death, military service or other hardships. (Studies have shown that children process that differently than abandonment.) We women blame ourselves for everything, including a loser ex-husband, and we shouldn't.

But let's not get confused. In a perfect world Dad is around and engaged with his kids. It's best for them and for us.

Years ago, we wouldn't have been shocked by a CEO father or politician joking about being absent and conceding the raising of his children to his wife. Thankfully, for the left and the right, those days are gone.

This isn't to say that men and women will ever play the same roles as parents. Women have higher expectations for themselves and for other women. We give birth. We nurse in the middle of the night. We love so deeply that it hurts. Men can only do one of those things.

But dads count, and they don't get a pass anymore. That's why it's so troubling that a presidential candidate was so glib about how little time he spends with his family, without any apparent feeling of sadness.

Contrast that with the frank and self-critical assessment of the former CEO of Pepsico, Indra Nooyi, who said bluntly in 2014 that ""women can't have it all"" and that because of her career, ""if you ask [my] daughters, I'm not sure they will say that I've been a good mom. I'm not sure.""

My husband and I are on the cusp of becoming empty nesters; our last child goes to college in the fall, so we're preparing for a new normal that doesn't revolve around the needs of children. We both are working through very complicated feelings, from great relief to deep sadness.

Even though I was the primary caregiver to my children when they were young, I can't help wondering whether I was right to go back to work full-time 10 years ago. Was I too ""lax""? Was I gone too much?

"Nunes: Twitter should come clean and give us their algorithms

California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, who has opened a $250 million lawsuit against Twitter alleging that the social media company negligently failed to remove defamatory and malicious tweets against him and his family, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit will be ""the first of many.""

Appearing on Fox News' ""Hannity,"" Nunes said he was going after Twitter first because they ""are the main proliferator"" of ""fake"" and ""slanderous"" news.

""The case we're basically making is this was an orchestrated effort. So people were targeting me, there were anonymous accounts that were developed ... and these accounts are not supposed to exist. Twitter says that they don't have accounts that do this,"" he said.

NUNES SUES TWITTER, SOME USERS, SEEKS OVER $250M ALLEGING ANTI-CONSERVATIVE 'SHADOW BANS,' SMEARS

Nunes' lawsuit accuses Twitter and a handful of its users of ""shadow-banning conservatives"" -- including himself -- to influence the 2018 election by censoring opposing viewpoints. Acknowledging the role that Twitter plays in modern politics, Nunes accused the social media platform of ""gaslighting"" for all of the news and ""proliferating"" only the content they supposedly agree with.

""And when they're regulating us, they're regulating what people can see on my tweets - which they've done - and then they're proliferating out things that they agree with the algorithms that they develop,"" he said. ""They need to come clean. They're not a public square. They are content developers.""

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified before Congress last year that his platform is a kind of ""digital public square,"" although he has insisted that Twitter, as a private company, retains the right to censor speech.

TWITTER CEO: PLATFORM WAS PROBABLY 'WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE' IN BANNING ACCOUNTS

Nunes, accused Twitter of a double standard, questioning why the company would allow certain accounts -- which, by its own terms of service, he said shouldn't exist in the first place -- to attack him ""hundreds of times a day.""

""I guarantee you, if I put something out that was sexually explicit or attacked someone personally they would stop it,"" Nunes said. ""They never did that to any of the people that were coming after me or other conservatives.""

Twitter did not comment on the suit when reached earlier by Fox News.

Nunes' lawsuit alleges defamation, conspiracy and negligence, seeking not only damages, but also an injunction compelling Twitter to turn over the identities behind numerous accounts he says harassed him and deliberately interfered in his investigation as House Intelligence Committee chair into corruption and Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election.

"Detail from new Jon McNaughton painting about Trump at the border (Jon McNaughton video/YouTube)

NeverTrumper Evangelical Michael Gerson says that the Religious Right has embraced End Times politics. Excerpt:

More recently, however, the populist right has taken on a distinctively religious tone. Rather than offering a vision of salvation, it has embraced a certain eschatology -- a theory of the end times. The threat of liberalism, in this view, has become so dire that the wrong outcome of a presidential race could mean the end of U.S. civilization. One appalling defense of Trump dubbed 2016 the ""Flight 93 election,"" on the theory that conservatives have but two choices: ""charge the cockpit"" or ""die.""

But the appeal of Trump and his supporters is distinctive. It is used as a mental preparation for extreme measures. If the political world is really headed toward disaster, then the normal political tools -- things such as civility, persuasion and governing skill -- are outmoded. If it is really just minutes to midnight for America, then maybe the situation requires an abrasive outsider willing to fight fire with napalm. Desperation increases the appetite for political risk.

There are serious dangers to the cultivation of desperation. It transforms opponents into enemies. It turns compromise into heresy. And it paves the way for authoritarian thinking and measures.

Hmm. I tend to see Trump as a kind of katechon holding back the deluge, but I don't take seriously those people who claim that God has his hand on Trump, and certainly not in any eschatological way. The election that ends Trump's presidential career will be like a dam break. A lot of pent-up energy from the left is going to roll down like thunder. I don't believe a single presidential election could make or break the United States. Our decline is not primarily political; political decline is one manifestation of something broader and deeper. Once Trump and Pence are out of the White House, a lot of things that were held back will be free to be expressed by the Democrat that takes over. Those who are concerned about religious liberty had better be laboring now to get ready for what's coming.",238,The American Conservative,"The Late, Great Planet Trump"
"Trump vetoes congressional resolution blocking southern border emergency

It's unclear what legislative issues may consume Congress between now and the end of September but one thing's for sure: President Trump's veto of a measure to terminate his national emergency for the border has the potential to spark another government shutdown on Oct. 1.

Yes, the president and Congress just sparred over the border wall during the 35-day shutdown which ended this past January. They could be back at it again soon because Trump elected to go around Congress, testing the limits of the Constitution and separation of powers, and mining appropriations bills for wall money.

It was thought that the bipartisan attitude on Capitol Hill which forged a funding agreement could generate cooperation and goodwill heading into Fiscal Year 2020. But, President Trump's national emergency declaration may have doomed any charity left in Congress.

The House and Senate lack the votes to override Trump's veto. The House is about 40 votes shy. The Senate is eight votes off the mark. The House is still set to try the override on March 26, but it's almost certain the override endeavor will perish there -- and President Trump will use his declaration to use various military funds to cover the cost of the wall unless blocked by a federal court.

Now the administration has presented lawmakers with a list which details a pool of military projects from which it may use cash to pay for the wall. The administration has called the clump of money ""unobligated."" It amounts to $12.9 billion.

""He is planning to take funds from real, effective operational priorities and needed projects and divert them to his vanity wall. That may help shore up his political base, but it could come at the expense of our military bases and the men and women of our Armed Forces who rely on them,"" said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.

Congress is just starting to prepare the 12 appropriations bills which fund the government for FY '20. Almost all Democrats, and frankly, many Republicans, have described Trump's effort to bypass Congress as brazen. Lawmakers of both parties have guarded Congressional prerogatives of the purse closely, so it's likely a bipartisan group of lawmakers will start to install restrictions to curb the president from diverting funds in the next spending round - without direct Congressional approval.

Therein lies the rub.

President Trump's budget request calls for $8.6 billion in wall funding for FY '20. Congress likely will grant the president some of the money - but not all. Will he attempt to sidestep Congress again? Will Trump veto bills where Congress tries to re-assert its power of the purse or curb his ability to circumvent the traditional appropriations process? That's where a possible shutdown comes in.

Meantime, it's unclear what Congress can tackle the rest of the year.

Infrastructure? No action. Washington recently saw another ""infrastructure week"" but there was no sign of any progress.

There's a lot of talk about trade, but the administration hasn't yet forged a formal agreement with China. Negotiators did ink a pact with Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Still, there's no timetable for the House or Senate to consider the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer met last week with House Democrats, but it's anyone's guess when or if anything could move through Congress on trade.

The agenda in the Senate focuses mostly on the confirmation of judges and other administration nominees. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has a few more queued up for next week, but the actual GOP agenda is unclear.

Tax reform is done, for good or ill. Republicans can't go back to take yet another stab at repealing and replacing ObamaCare, so the GOP is trained on problems of the Democrats. McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., routinely have pilloried Dems over their own internal divides. GOP leaders simply have pointed out issues Democrats have had with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, among others. The House Republican leadership brass routinely has gone after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for not doing more to keep the conduct of Omar and Tlaib in check.

BORDER PATROL UNION LEADER: CONGRESS IS WRONG, NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON THE BORDER IS REAL

McConnell's set up a procedural vote to try starting debate next week on the Green New Deal, backed by Ocasio-Cortez and others. The Senate needs 60 yeas just to launch debate.

Senate Republicans certainly don't support the Green New Deal. McConnell's gambit is to get Democrats on the record as either supporting or rejecting the measure. Consider all of the Senate Democrats running for President: Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- not to mention Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. McConnell clearly would love to register a roll call vote on where Democrats stand in favor of the Green New Deal. Then, Republicans could crow about how radical and out-of-step the Democrats have been.

Or, McConnell also would enjoy Democrats opposing the Green New Deal. He then could exclaim that Ocasio-Cortez's blueprint was too drastic even for the most liberal and environmentally friendly voices in the Democratic party. Either way, McConnell would get something he's wanted.

But, it's unclear whether he would score something definitive. The vote set for next week is just a procedural vote. It's two steps away from an actual up-or-down vote on the underlying measure. Any vote to start debate -- or to prevent the measure from coming to the floor -- is muddled when it comes to messaging. Sure, McConnell could say that Ocasio-Cortez's resolution was too far-flung to merit debate. But, that's not the strongest argument to make in politics.

This is why the legislative agenda on Capitol Hill is so jumbled. There's no clear path on what the sides can accomplish in the coming months. There will be a fight over lifting the debt ceiling this summer. How the sides resolve that is unclear.

"In an interview with CNBC in January, Myron Brilliant of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce described the American-Chinese relationship as ""too big to fail."" In recent years, a number of commentators and public figures have used that same phrase. The thinking goes that because the U.S. and China are such large powers, a failure of the bilateral relationship would have catastrophic consequences for both the economy and global security.

This logic encouraged the American establishment to assume that economic interdependence between the two powers would promote stability. Both parties, they reasoned, would fear the consequences of discord and thus moderate their behavior. For many years, this assumption held up. But given China's increasingly unrestrained and threatening behavior since Xi Jinping assumed power, American leaders have grown uncertain as to whether economic interdependence with China is beneficial for the U.S.

But even if deep economic ties with China are a net positive for the U.S., should they ever really grow ""too big to fail""? That phrase is a curious one, given the nasty reputation it's developed since the 2008 financial meltdown. It is most commonly used to describe the problem of moral hazard risk during financial crises, which provides a surprisingly useful analogy for the U.S.-China political-economic relationship. Economists have argued that the 2008 crisis was worsened by the fact that financial institutions, well aware of their systemic importance to the American economy, engaged in risky behavior because they knew they would likely be bailed out in the event of a crisis. Most importantly, those institutions believed that American lawmakers understood that it was not in their political interest to allow the banks to collapse.

An analogous problem arises from China's extensive economic ties with the U.S. (and other countries). If the Chinese government is aware that the relationship is perceived in Washington as ""too big to fail,"" it might reason that it can get away with all sorts of egregious acts without suffering serious consequences. Deep economic ties with China increase the likelihood that American politicians will be unable or unwilling to let the relationship fail. In fact, this logic led China to incorrectly assume that President Donald Trump's trade war threats were merely bluffs. Beijing understood, for example, that a collapse in Chinese soybean purchases would directly harm the pocketbooks of Trump's base. It also knew that Fortune 500 companies would be extremely displeased. It therefore believed that it wasn't in Trump's political interest to risk the economic relationship.

In this way, economic engagement with China can be destabilizing, not to mention threatening to a variety of American interests, when it emboldens the worst tendencies of China's ""president for life."" Of course, there have been times when Chinese and American actions have been restrained. For instance, China's military hawks have advocated, unsuccessfully, for Beijing to dump massive quantities of U.S. treasuries in response to American naval actions in China's backyard. Because the two nations are so economically interdependent, such a move would have caused too much damage to the Chinese economy.

Nonetheless, differences in domestic institutions have made this logic untenable under many circumstances. As an autocracy, the Chinese Communist Party is never beholden to domestic interest groups in the way that U.S. politicians typically are. For example, when China halted exports of rare earth minerals to Japan in 2010 following a dispute over the East China Sea, the Chinese Communist Party did not risk being voted out of office by its mining industry. But for the Japanese government, allowing the tech sector to come to a grinding halt as a result of losing that mineral supply would have been political suicide. Because economic independence constrained the Japanese government and not the Chinese government, Beijing prevailed. As China's economic relations with other nations grow, this problem will only get worse.

While Trump's trade war may help course-correct the economic relationship, it will not eliminate this inherent vulnerability if it doesn't reduce economic ties between the two countries. If China's domestic institutions remain unchanged, the U.S. will be far more constrained by the relationship than China will ever be. Therefore, allowing ""too big to fail"" is unsafe for American interests.

To be sure, just because the U.S. should be concerned about a ""too big to fail"" problem doesn't mean it should let the relationship with China fail entirely or sever economic ties. That would be disastrous for all parties. But making it clear to China that the U.S. can reduce ties if necessary is a critical part of developing a healthier bilateral relationship. And given the nature of democratic institutions, the only way to reduce this vulnerability is to pursue more limited economic engagement with China.

New Zealand provides a disturbing example. As China's economic ties with New Zealand have expanded, Chinese behavior has grown more menacing. A 2018 report from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service details China's elaborate strategy in New Zealand to ""influence political decision-making, pursue unfair advantages in trade and business, suppress criticism of China, facilitate espionage opportunities, and influence overseas Chinese communities.""

These programs have a long history in China. But President Xi Jinping, presiding over an era of unprecedented national economic prowess, has taken them to new extremes. For example, Anne-Marie Brady, a Chinese politics professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, was subjected to a year-long intimidation campaign that she said was orchestrated by the Chinese government. After publishing her research on Chinese influence operations abroad, her house was burglarized, her office was broken into twice, and her family car was sabotaged. She also received threatening letters and numerous phone calls in the middle of the night on her unlisted number. New Zealand has done little to counter these threats, likely due to fear of economic retaliation from the Chinese government. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern recently called her country's relationship with China ""robust and mature.""

China's response to other nations' restrictions on Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, may foreshadow this. Beijing recently banned Australian coal imports, a move that was likely retaliation for Australia banning Huawei from its 5G networks. Similarly, after New Zealand restricted the use of Huawei equipment in its national 5G network, Beijing rescinded its invitation for Ardern to visit Beijing and called off the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism program.

The predatory nature of China's global economic ambitions should necessitate that the U.S. stop considering its relationship ""too big to fail"" and encourage its allies to pursue more limited economic engagement. The Trump administration's inclination to insult our allies while showing bitter contempt for multilateralism will likely make this task more difficult, if not impossible for the foreseeable future. But if the U.S. fails, China's behavior is certain to get only worse in the future.",240,The American Conservative,America's Relationship With China Can't Become Too Big to Fail

""He's looking for someone to mind the store while he spreads his wings and tries to fly,"" one former City Hall insider joked.

The ex-insider said the mayor's public flirtation with a 2020 bid makes it tougher to recruit top talent.

""Who wants to be the fall guy when the mayor's called home for domestic duty and s-‚Ää-t's gone haywire?"" the source said.

Joseph Esposito is still running the city's Emergency Management Department even though he was axed in early December after a botched response to a snowstorm.

Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia is filling in at NYCHA as a search continues for a permanent agency chief.

Vacancies also exist in the departments of Aging, Buildings, Payroll, Media and Entertainment, Special Projects and Community Events and Technology.

Another former City Hall staffer said that second-term staffing is always tough for mayors, but that de Blasio has complicated the process.

""For Mayor de Blasio, recruiting is a bit more challenging because he has not focused primarily on New York City issues and concerns during the past year or so"" the ex-staffer said.

""That's a mistake for many reasons, but the most important is holding onto what you have.""

Lynne Patton, the regional administrator for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, rebuked de Blasio for touring early-primary states in recent weeks.

""Since everyone keeps making this about politics instead of people, maybe the @NYCMayor should stay in his ACTUAL STATE & identify a new @NYCHA chair who will spend our $30M per week on ACTUAL REPAIRS than wasteful UNION OT the mayor won't abrogate due to his own political goals!"" Patton tweeted Monday.

Kathryn Wylde, president of the nonprofit Partnership for New York that represents the city's business community, predicted de Blasio's legacy would suffer from the staff shortage.

""Later in the administration, it's very hard to get the same quality of people as you attract going in,"" Wylde said.

""You end up with the great people who stick with you doing double duty,"" she said, citing Garcia as well as Lorraine Grillo, who's running both the School Construction Authority and the Department of Design and Construction.

"Liberal NY college students demand administrators deal with 'racist white professors,' provide free detergent

A politics professor whose op-ed in The New York Times in October helped spark protests among liberal students at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., now claims the college and faculty have left him to fight the backlash alone.

Samuel J. Abrams, who has a PhD from Harvard University and an AB from Stanford University, told Fox News via email Monday evening: ""Faculty have to hold the line on free speech and promote discourse. That didn't happen at Sarah Lawrence, and I hope that my story is a warning that is heard around the country.""

Students claimed they were offended by the supposed ""anti-Blackness, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-woman bigotry"" of Abrams, professor of politics at Sarah Lawrence College, and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and staged a large sit-in. They also presented demands, such as a ""tenure review.""

He said Monday evening that his philosophy was not an attack on students: ""Viewpoint diversity is asking that multiple viewpoints are considered on campus and in the classroom. So that means rather than simply attack capitalism and free markets without a deep understanding of history and teach socialism, we also teach the value of markets, choice and individualism.""

He said his ideology has been to teach students the realities of adult life: ""Rather than teach that government needs to get bigger, and is the solution to poverty and improving the welfare of Americans, and this is often the only view taught, we need to also teach how capitalism has lifted millions up, and allowed markets to make the nation efficient.""

Abrams said 40 professors endorsed the demand list, and 12 percent of the faculty ""endorsed the students' demand to challenge my tenure and my right to free speech and the expression of ideas.""

The college didn't return Fox News' request for comment.

""...With the (students') latest attempt to attack academic freedom, the Sarah Lawrence faculty could have redeemed themselves and been galvanized to support free expression. Instead, they opted for silence -- and, what's worse, many of them were supportive of the student protesters' demands,"" Abrams wrote in The Spectator over the weekend.

He also wrote about the repercussions he received for the original opinion piece last fall: ""There was a national media storm in which I was slandered and defamed, my family's safety was threatened, and my personal property was destroyed on campus.""

I think the New Zealand killing is a much bigger deal than these things tend to be. I've heard some complaining among my political tribe that our media don't notice when scores of Christians in Nigeria are murdered in one stroke by Muslim fanatics in Boko Haram. They're correct to point out the disinterest -- some of which may be politically motivated -- but from the point of view of Western news audiences, what happened in NZ really is a more significant act -- and it's not because the lives of Muslim worshipers in New Zealand are worth more than the lives of Christians in Nigeria.

This requires unpacking. First, take a look at this thread:

Giesea then refers to this piece from two years ago, in the New Yorker, asking the question: Is America sliding towards civil war? The author interviewed Keith Mines, a national security expert who studies civil wars. Mines thinks that the US is likely to face a new civil war in the next ten to fifteen years. Excerpt:

Based on his experience in civil wars on three continents, Mines cited five conditions that support his prediction: entrenched national polarization, with no obvious meeting place for resolution; increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows; weakened institutions, notably Congress and the judiciary; a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership; and the legitimization of violence as the ""in"" way to either conduct discourse or solve disputes.

Entrenched national polarization, with no obvious meeting place for resolution? Check.

Weakened institutions, notably Congress and the judiciary? Check.

Sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership? I'm not quite sure what data I could cite here to support this claim, but ask yourself: does our current political leadership seem responsible to you? On either side? And, do you think that the American people have created the conditions in which responsible political leaders would arise? I don't. I mean, I am very happy to blame the political class, because I think they are actually blameworthy. But I don't want to give a pass to the rest of us. We can't even agree today on what a ""responsible"" political leadership would look like.

Increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows? Absolutely -- and this is something I want to talk about with regard to the NZ killing.

Yesterday a reader of this blog got in touch to say that he was recently tutoring a college student, and heard the undergraduate make a strange remark about a particular historical event. The claim was demonstrably, unambiguously false, but the kid thought it was the gospel truth. It was an alt-right claim. My source, the tutor, asked the kid where he heard such a thing; the kid said he got it from YouTube, where he gets all his news and information about the world.

""This is how so many of the college students today are,"" said my source, who works with them on a major US campus. ""They learn about the outside world from YouTube and social media. They don't even stop to think about whether or not it's a credible source.""

My interlocutor got in touch with me because he said that 4chan and related sources are radicalizing some white males he sees on his campus, and it scares him. I am sure that antifa and its analogues on the social media left are doing the same thing on the other side. The key point here is that news and information has become radically decentralized, and authority has been all but destroyed. My source yesterday told me that the big question of my generation -- are the media biased to the left or the right? -- doesn't exist for the young today.

This is not news, I know. We've been talking for years about the fragmentation of the media and the separation of people inside information silos. What I don't believe that we've really confronted is what happens when we construct an information environment for ourselves that only allows the most radical information through the filter.

For example, I follow the trans-critical Twitter account 4th Wave Now, which was founded by a liberal mom who questioned transgender ideology when her teenage daughter claimed to be male (the daughter has now desisted, and identifies as a lesbian). Someone leaked to them screengrabs of a private Facebook group for parents of trans kids. Today, 4WN posted images showing how the administrators and others silence anyone who questions the ideological narrative. Check out this thread for more. The people on the forum self-censor for the sake of constructing a particular worldview, and treating those who don't share it as mortal threats. Seriously, look:

""Suicide or transition."" Now, consider that in the white supremacist online forums to which Tarrant subscribed, the narrative is either radical resistance or racial and civilizational suicide. What Tarrant and his ideological confreres are doing is ""eliminating the grayzone."" Analyst Justin Lee explains what this means. Excerpt:

The influential editorial ""The Extinction of the Grayzone,"" published by the Islamic State's online magazine Dabiq in 2015, lays out a strategy for radicalizing ""moderate"" Muslims living in the West. These moderates constitute the ""grayzone""‚Ää -- ‚ÄäMuslims who have neither fully apostatized and joined the ""Crusaders,"" nor joined the camp of the genuinely faithful (the Caliphate). The strategy is to turn up the heat on grayzone Muslims‚Ää -- ‚Ääthrough precipitating Islamophobia‚Ää -- ‚Ääso that they are forced either to abandon their faith entirely or to radicalize:

The Muslims in the West will quickly find themselves between one of two choices, they either apostatize and adopt the kufrƒ´ religion propagated by Bush, Obama, Blair, Cameron, Sarkozy, and Hollande in the name of Islam so as to live amongst the kuffƒÅr without hardship, or they perform hijrah to the Islamic State and thereby escape persecution from the crusader governments and citizens.

Scott Atran, director of research in anthropology at CNRS, raised the alarm on this strategy‚Ää -- ‚Ääand our failure to counter it‚Ää -- ‚Ääin a 2015 essay on the Islamic State's revolutionary ambitions. ""We might wish to celebrate diversity and tolerance in the grayzone,"" he writes, ""but the general trend in Europe and the majority of the U.S. political establishment and population is to collude in erasing it."" The Islamic State knew it could depend on European and American Islamophobia to swell its ranks.

The Christchurch shooter adopted the same strategy, swapping the Muslim Ummah for whites of European descent. With this act of terror, he aimed to put pressure on what might be called ""whites of the grayzone."" He employs a lot of bog-standard conservative and declinist language in his manifesto, knowing that associating himself with these ideas will draw media ire for conservatives (whom he utterly despises). His goal is to inspire anti-white hatred, in the same way the Islamic State attempted to inspire Islamophobia. In both cases, it greases the rails of radicalization.

More, on Tarrant's strategy, as articulated in his manifesto:

He's counting on the left to blame conservatives and right-wing populists for his crimes. The idea is to precipitate‚Ää -- ‚Ääor, as he would phrase it, ""accelerate""‚Ää -- ‚Ääa racial purification of the right by making every political battle a matter of race.

Read the whole thing. Lee says the only way to resist what Tarrant is trying to do is for the right to resist victimization narratives, and for the left to resist the temptation to turn every point of contention between left and right into a battle over white supremacy.

He's right about that, but I am not optimistic that we can do it. Our national media follows more or less the same script every time there's a mass terror attack: if radical Muslims carried it out, the media focus on how much innocent Muslims suffer from the acts of the radicals; now, when Muslims really are the victims of white supremacists, the narrative remains the same. Please understand: I do not say this in a gripey ""whatabout"" spirit! Justin Lee is correct to say that people on the right need to resist the urge to embrace victimization. The point I'm making is that the mainstream media coverage will serve Tarrant's ultimate goal if journalists read and report on events according to the standard liberal narrative.

(That's the mainstream media -- the ones who both express and shape the worldview of the establishment's leaders. I think we can safely say that the forces of radicalization on both the left and the right will massively intensify on social media.)

As I wrote over the weekend in the post titled ""Radicalization & Degeneration,"" what massively complicates our response to this is that there is some truth in Tarrant's cultural diagnosis (just as there was, and is, some truth in the Islamist ideologue Sayyid Qutb's diagnosis, and the Unabomber's). We would be extremely foolish to dismiss these violent radicals as senseless. Western culture really is in a condition of decline and possible fall, and fighting white nationalism cannot possibly require being in denial about that -- not if it's actually going to work.

Look, I know well the tendency we all have to want to refuse to give these blood-soaked monsters any legitimacy; that comes from a good place inside us. But it is dangerous, because it blinds us to the appeal these radicals have to others who are living in conditions that the rest of us can't recognize, or don't understand.

Tarrant is a young man who is friendless, womanless, aimless, rootless, hopeless, and jobless. He comes from a town where there is little to no economic future. On the Internet, he found a pseudo-community that gave him a sense of meaning and purpose, and vindicated his feelings of victimization. As I've mentioned here recently, in reading lately about the Sovietization of Eastern Europe after 1945, I learned that the rootlessness and hopelessness of masses of people displaced by the Great Depression and war made quite a few willing to accept communist totalitarianism as a way forward. It gave them a sense of brotherhood, of dignity, and of purpose. Sure it was a lie, a monstrous lie (as they all discovered eventually), but it gave these nowhere men and women a reason to live and die. That's incredibly powerful.

I don't see how we stop the current process. The Internet empowers men like Tarrant -- and societal trends are creating more of them. Here's Geoff Dench writing in Quillette:

On virtually every indicator that anyone might want to consider, men in Britain and various other Western states seem to be performing very badly at the moment, both for themselves and for the communities in which they live. Not that this is particularly unusual. Throughout history, men have been inclined towards being social outsiders. Their usefulness to communities varies much more than women's, and depends greatly on the way in which social institutions define and reward their roles. Whereas most cultures seem to recognize this, in the West we have increasingly pretended that it is not the case.

And we are now paying for our mistake.

Many people are asking themselves whether some of the radical social experiments attempted in recent generations are viable in the long term, or should now be ditched. It is not too late to face up to the problem. But we have such an accumulation of policy errors to deal with that we require a thorough re-orientation of public discourse before we can expect any specific measures to have much positive effect. The sort of shift we need encompasses some key elements of the sexual division of labor, grounded in stronger marriage institutions, and linked with a conceptual unscrambling of men's roles, both private and public.

It's worth pointing out that China and India are going to have a hell of a mess on their hands given that for political and cultural reasons, they have sex-selected societies in which the male-female ratio is hugely imbalanced. This story about the pain and loneliness of men in China and India who will never marry or know female companionship will bring tears to your eyes -- and, if you have any common sense, it will scare you, because all those men are vulnerable to a charismatic leader who will acknowledge their suffering and channel it into something violent and destructive. I'm serious; read it, because there's something very, very powerful here. Excerpt:

Sooner or later, someone is going to come along to answer that question in a way that turns that pain outward, and focuses it on some scapegoat. That's what Brenton Tarrant did. That's what Antifa does. That's what ISIS does. And so on.

That bring us to Keith Mines's fifth condition for civil war: the legitimization of violence as the ""in"" way to either conduct discourse or solve disputes.

Clausewitz famously said that ""War is the continuation of politics by other means."" When normal politics breaks down, we should not be surprised when violence erupts. Earlier this year, riding in a Dublin taxi, I listened to the driver, a middle-aged man, talk about how glad we was that Ireland was done with the Church, but how he also despises the ruling class of all parties. He said they are only in it for themselves, and to protect their own privileges. The cost of living is going up and up, he said, and the elites have locked people like him and his children out. If the Yellow Vests movement comes to Ireland, he said, he will probably take to the streets with them.

Ireland is a democracy. Why would a man like that conclude that normal politics don't work for people like him? Whether or not the man is making an accurate judgment about political prospects in Ireland, this is what he believes is the truth, and he is angry about it -- so angry that he would likely take to the streets to demonstrate if the right leaders came along. What's interesting to me is that this man has no faith at all in Irish democracy's leaders.

What happens when people come to believe at best that they have no stake in a political order, and at worst that the people administering that political order consider people like them to be enemies to be crushed? This is something that we are not allowing ourselves to see. If you read Tarrant's manifesto -- which you can find online; I'm not going to link it here -- you see that he doesn't just despise the left, but also conservatives, as well as business leaders who, in his view, profit from immigration """"Kill your local anti-white CEO,"" he advises). He is truly diabolical, even calling for the murder of non-white children. It's easy to regard Tarrant as one of life's great losers, a fool who got lost in an online pseudo-reality in which he is a great warrior participating in a life-or-death civilizational struggle, instead of what he really is: a friendless weirdo who couldn't find a girlfriend.

But 50 people are dead in Christchurch because this weirdo acted out his role-playing fantasy with live ammunition -- and broadcast it to angry dispossessed white males around the world whose only connection is through the Internet.

As we know from Tarrant's manifesto, he is hoping to provoke a strong backlash from the left, especially in the US, around gun violence. He is an accelerationist, meaning he wants to heighten the tensions in liberal democracies, and bring about actual fighting. His hope is that the left will push too far. Along those lines, and about violence, take a look at this Atlantic essay from the April issues, posted online a few days ago, by David Frum, titled, ""If Liberals Won't Enforce Borders, Fascists Will.""

Demagogues don't rise by talking about irrelevant issues. Demagogues rise by talking about issues that matter to people, and that more conventional leaders appear unwilling or unable to address: unemployment in the 1930s, crime in the 1960s, mass immigration now. Voters get to decide what the country's problems are. Political elites have to devise solutions to those problems. If difficult issues go unaddressed by responsible leaders, they will be exploited by irresponsible ones.

Notice this paragraph; remember that this was written before the Christchurch attacks:

When natives have lots of children of their own, immigrants look like reinforcements. When natives have few children, immigrants look like replacements. No wonder that, according to a 2016 survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic, nearly half of white working-class Americans agree with this statement: ""Things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.""

Tarrant titled his manifesto: THE GREAT REPLACEMENT.

One more Frum quote:

With immigration pressures bound to increase, it becomes more imperative than ever to restore the high value of national citizenship, not to denigrate or disparage others but because for many of your fellow citizens -- perhaps less affluent, educated, and successful than you -- the claim ""I am a U.S. citizen"" is the only claim they have to any resources or protection. Without immigration restrictions, there are no national borders. Without national borders, there are no nation-states. Without nation-states, there are no electorates. Without electorates, there is no democracy. If liberals insist that only fascists will enforce borders, then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals refuse to do.

Yes, borders are arbitrary. And, yes, more people are arguing that we should care as much about people in faraway lands as we do about our fellow Americans. But the practical effect of making this argument is to enable the powerful to care as little for their fellow Americans as they do for people in faraway lands.

One big takeaway from the Frum essay -- something I took away from it, not necessarily something Frum endorses -- is that we are living in a time of massive global disruption, resulting in an unprecedented move of peoples; this is affecting us in the US, as it is most people, but our elites -- especially liberals -- don't recognize or don't care about how it's affecting the native-born.

Right now, a lot of the poor and working class -- especially whites -- have turned their despair onto themselves, via drug and alcohol abuse, and suicide. What if they turned that outward? What if their children were to become radicalized online? How would we stop it? Would they not be correct to judge that the US elites consider them to be expendables and deplorables? Understand me: there is never justification for killing innocent people of any race or religion. My point is that social trends, in particular some embraced and advocated by liberal elites, are further fragmenting and alienating people -- and technology is creating the conditions for some of these rootless men to nurture their own sense of alienation and grievance, and to turn that into violent acts.

I'll leave you with this last thing. Here's news from Arlington, Virginia, today:

In Arlington County, Virginia, not even kindergarteners are exempt from pro-transgender messaging. So reports The Washington Post, which, earlier this month, featured an article about Ashlawn Elementary School, which honored National ""Read Across America Day"" by hosting a transgender spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). The spokesperson read a story about a transgender child for a room full of kindergarten children.

Prominent media outlets claimed parents were notified beforehand and allowed opt their children out of the event. But those outlets got the story wrong. The letter, written solely in English despite the school's sizable non-English-fluent population, nowhere mentions ""opting out.""

This keeps happening. Public schools are indoctrinating kids into gender ideology. A friend e-mailed from the Pacific Northwest to say:

Yesterday in church a woman told us how concerned she is for her two granddaughters because of the gender indoctrination they receive in their school. While driving them to a party, one girl asked her, ""How many humans will be there?"" Later the other girl said, ""Look what that human is wearing."" Quite unconsciously now they do not use ""boy"" or ""girl.""

The girls are 3 and 4 years old. This is coming from their pre-school teacher!

These gender ideology activists and their institutional allies are destroying public schooling, but that's not a new thing. What we have to worry about is when they try to destroy homeschooling and private schooling that does not endorse their view -- and believe me, that is coming down the line, within the next couple of decades.

You want to foment violence? Tell people that they have to subject their children to this stuff, and have no choice. Start taking children away from their families so the state can jack them full of sex-change hormones. Note well that the mainstream media will only report from a position of affirming this extreme biological radicalism, and framing those who oppose it, or even question it, as bigots who are threatening the lives of children. As Jeff Giesea said in one of the Twitter posts with which I started this long comment:

There *are* legitimate issues & grievances to discuss, and there must be space to channel them through the democratic process.

Messing with people's children and cutting them out of the democratic process is a sure way to create radicals. Allowing mass numbers of people from other countries to immigrate into one's country while more and more people born here come to believe the people running the country would like to see them crushed and eliminated is a sure way to create radicals. Building a society that systematically or accidentally marginalizes and humiliates males -- especially males of a particular race, by design -- is a sure way to create radicals.

Here are relevant passages from a Carlo Lancellotti essay on Augusto Del Noce:

Rejection of transcendence has the effect that all human realities (the state, sexuality, work, the family) lose their symbolic or ideal significance and become ""dumb,"" completely devoid of any finality beyond the satisfaction of the immediate material or psychological needs that can be studied scientifically. It is in this sense that scientism, according to Del Noce, is the philosophical premise of the sexual revolution. At the same time, political struggles take an absolute value, replacing religion as the focus of social concern and the source of people's identity and meaning.

The flip side of the politicization of reason is the absolutization of politics, which to Del Noce is another definition of totalitarianism. Every aspect of reality is interpreted in terms of a political narrative, which becomes the interpretative key for all aspects of social life: law, education, medicine, the family. Society at all levels splits along political lines because ""culture is entirely subordinate to politics"" and ""the idea of politics is subsumed within the idea of war."" The older totalitarian movements had no desire to find a political accommodation between social classes or races: one side must eliminate the other. Likewise, no compromise is possible with ""repression"" and ""bigotry."" They must be simply fought and, ultimately, eliminated.

Now, to quote the Constitutional Peasant (but not with comic irony), now you see the violence inherent in the system. More Lancellotti:

Reading Del Noce today it is hard to escape the impression that the philosophical premises of today's situation were firmly in place by the early sixties, and that at a fundamental level not much has happened since, except for a slow process of decomposition, as befalls an organism that is no longer living. A society that consistently embraces scientism and instrumentalism must literally stop thinking in the properly philosophical sense, and become incapable of generating new ideals and new forms of life. It can only live by slowly consuming the ""reserves of meaning"" it received from the past, until they run out and its contradictions explode.

It's the exploding of these contradictions that we may be seeing now -- most of all the idea that you can have a stable society of radical individualists unbound to the past, the future, or anything outside of themselves. In the case of very online white supremacists, as in the case of the legion of teenagers documenting their gender dysphoria in evangelizing YouTube clips, we are watching the disintegration of the human personality reified and transmitted like a virus via electronic vectors into the hands of countless individuals who have been prepared for it through socialization via online discourse. The medium is the message, and the message is: you and your online friends are the only reality there is.

More Lancellotti:

At the time, Del Noce's remarks about the totalitarian aspects of modern Western society did not receive much attention. Today, he is remembered as a distinguished historian of ideas -- especially of Italian political thought in the twentieth century, of Gramsci and Gentile -- but his views about the contemporary world are often considered excessive, or even reactionary. After all, the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century seem firmly confined to the dustbin of history. We do not live in fear of being arrested by the secret police and sent to a concentration camp. How can anybody seriously think that we live in a totalitarian situation?

Del Noce would reply that these objections are reasonable but superficial, because what really defines totalitarianism is, once again, the subordination of both ethics and culture to politics. Coercion by force is not necessarily the best method to that effect. A better way is to remove the ""equipment"" that makes it possible to transcend politics: philosophical reason, nonutilitarian liberal education, national tradition, the family as a vehicle of ideal values. What is true is that the new totalitarianism is very different from older forms because it is a totalitarianism of disintegration, even before being a totalitarianism of domination. It dominates by disintegrating. Del Noce describes it also as ""negative millennialism"" because it radically rejects the past but cannot propose new values. Ironically, it is extremely ""conservative"" in the narrow sense of protecting the economic and political status quo, while it slowly dissolves its host society into what Del Noce calls a ""non-society,"" because no shared ideals bind together its members.

In such a situation, resistance is in constant danger of becoming a sequence of reactive responses to every new turn in the process of decomposition. Del Noce considers it a mistake to think that the Western ""crisis"" can be overcome by purely political means, especially because totalitarian cultures prevent real debate precisely by politicizing everything. The technological society does it by framing every discussion in terms of the opposition of ""progressive"" and ""conservative.""

Read the whole thing. Del Noce is onto something massively important throughout these passages. Keep his final line above in mind as you watch, read, and listen to the debate play out over how to react to the New Zealand attacks. The media's reflexive framing it as a matter of ""progressive"" and ""conservative"" responses conceal more radical questions at stake. Brenton Tarrant is a devil from the pit of hell, but the terrible truth is that he sees some fault lines of conflict within our civilization more clearly than many of us middle class normies do. Outsiders of all kinds often do.",244,The American Conservative,Brenton Tarrant: Nowhere Man
"Former Vice President Biden may be preparing to run for president as ""Middle-Class Joe,"" but as Politico's Holly Otterbein and Marc Caputo point out, he's got a $2.7 million vacation home, charges more than $100,000 per speaking gig and has a book deal likely worth seven figures. Indeed, since leaving office, Biden ""has watched his bank account swell,"" even as he ""continues to cultivate the image of a regular, Amtrak-riding guy."" Fact is, his ""avowed distance from the upper class"" is ""central to his political identity,"" though he argues that ""middle class"" isn't ""so much a financial status"" as ""a state of mind."" Needless to say, skeptics on the left -- who have grown ""increasingly concerned with vast income inequality"" -- see it differently.

Conservative: Dems Aren't Defending Chelsea Clinton

Are Democrats ever ""prepared to tell the progressive grassroots something that they don't want to hear?"" That's the question National Review's Jim Geraghty is asking after the surprising silence to Chelsea Clinton ¬≠being confronted by two NYU students who accused her of having ""stoked"" the New Zealand mosque massacre by criticizing Rep. Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitism. Needless to say, Clinton had nothing to do with the massacre and her denunciation of anti-Semitism was ""right, proper and needed."" Yet the confrontation has received little attention from the mainstream media. And -- with the notable exception of Mayor de Blasio -- most Democrats ""prefer to avert their eyes, pretend they didn't see it and hope that the news cycle moves on quickly."" Frankly, asks Geraghty, ""if Donald Trump Jr. is willing to stand up for Chelsea Clinton, what ¬≠excuse does anyone else have?""

Beltway vet: Pelosi's Problems Are Just Beginning

Nancy Pelosi can thank ""the adoration of the national press corps,"" which ""really wants her to succeed"" as House speaker, for news coverage that makes it seem like she's firmly in charge, contends Peter Roff at Newsweek. In fact, though, she's ""a woman with a lot of problems."" And it's the same problem, he says, that faced Republican Newt Gingrich a quarter-century ago: a ""huge freshman class that think they invented Democracy."" In her case, it's a case of people committed less to ""real and substantive policy changes"" than in using their new platform ""to advance a new and socialistic state of mind in traditional and social media."" So Pelosi finds herself with ""the tail wagging the dog."" But while she hasn't yet lost control of her caucus, ""she's not setting any records for party unity.""

Foreign desk: Netanyahu Challenger's Major Handicap

Israelis who want to end Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 10-year reign are pinning their hopes on former Army Chief of Staff Benny Gantz. He's ""not a bad choice,"" agrees Zev Chafets at Bloomberg, ""but he is new to politics, and it shows."" Indeed, Gantz ""lacks what Bibi has in spades -- political acumen. He poses a lot but rarely talks."" In fact, ""he has given only a few speeches and more than once he has gone badly off script."" And he ""lacks the military charisma of ¬≠political generals like Ariel Sharon, Ehud Barak or Moshe Dayan."" Moreover, Gantz ""has failed to portray himself as a moderate alternative to Netanyahu's hardline nationalism."" They actually ""agree on just about every major issue.""

Health watch: Why No Concern Over Ebola Recurrence?

Five years ago, notes Ronald Klain at The Washington Post, the US was ""gripped with fear and awash in news coverage as the worst Ebola outbreak in history spread in West Africa."" Yet today, the second-worst outbreak is under way in Congo, and ""most Americans seem unaware or unconcerned."" Granted, this outbreak has seen only a small fraction of the number of deaths recorded in 2014. And the earlier outbreak reached the US, when an infected patient brought the disease to Dallas. Yet, even with a vaccine, ""the death toll continues to mount"" and regional violence has forced response organizations to withdraw. Says Klain: ""Adding significantly more US disease fighters in Congo, and placing them closer to the outbreak, would be dangerous, but needs to be considered.""",245,New York Post,The myth of 'middle-class Joe Biden' and other commentary

On the roster: Beto 2020 off to a rocky start - Gillibrand formally joins the 2020 race - Hogan pitches himself as a traditional Republican - Poll: Americans' trust in Mueller is decreasing - 'Eat mor chikin' ad IRL

BETO 2020 OFF TO A ROCKY START

Politico: ""A more disciplined candidate might not have been so sloppy, with months to prepare and adoring crowds waiting. Yet there was Beto O'Rourke, wobbling on policy, offending women with a joke about child care, frustrating local Democrats with his high-handedness and picking bewildering fights with the media. ... O'Rourke's liabilities began showing soon after he arrived in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state. On Friday, the second day of his campaign, the former Texas congressman was forced to apologize for what he called 'really hateful' writings from his youth... Hours later, O'Rourke was apologizing for ham-handedly joking about his wife, Amy, raising their children 'sometimes with my help.' ... Yet he was still confronting his previous comments as recently as Sunday -- after drawing criticism for remarks printed on the cover of Vanity Fair in which O'Rourke said before entering the race that he was 'just born to be in it.' ... It was not a clean start to O'Rourke's 2020 run. Though he benefited from nonstop media coverage, a blockbuster initial fundraising figure, and his own political acuity ... O'Rourke's opening act also laid bare disorder in his nascent campaign.""

But his fundraising is through the roof - WaPo: ""Beto O'Rourke reported raising more than $6.1 million during the first 24 hours of his presidential campaign, a record-setting haul that narrowly tops the amount announced by Sen. Bernie Sanders and dwarfs everyone else in the 2020 field. O'Rourke was a fundraising juggernaut during his U.S. Senate race in Texas last year, but there were significant questions about whether that would translate to a national campaign... The answer appears to be yes. O'Rourke's campaign said he raised $6,136,763 from donations that came from all 50 states, D.C., and every U.S. territory. 'In just 24 hours, Americans across this country came together to prove that it is possible to run a true grassroots campaign for president -- a campaign by all of us for all of us that answers not to the PACs, corporations, and special interests but to the people,' O'Rourke said in a statement.""

He gave Biden a lot of support to enter the race too - Politico: ""The first time Beto O'Rourke praised Joe Biden, it could have been dismissed as an act of diplomacy. 'I don't see why not,' the newly minted presidential candidate said Friday when asked outside a campaign stop in Washington, Iowa, whether he thought Biden should run for president. 'I think he's done an extraordinary job for this country as senator and as vice president. ... I think very highly of him.' Then it happened again, when an Iowan in Independence told O'Rourke, who is 46, that he wanted 'to see some young people run for president' and would prefer that Biden -- who has 30 years on O'Rourke -- stay out. O'Rourke could have let the comment hang in the air, but he came immediately to Biden's defense. And Biden was still on his mind several hours later.""

RNC criticized over St. Patrick's Day tweet featuring Beto - Fox News: ""The Republican National Committee on Sunday tweeted out a 'special message' from 'noted Irishman Robert Francis O'Rourke,' by sending his mugshot with a leprechaun hat that was widely criticized as insensitive. O'Rourke has previously admitted to a 1998 arrest when he was 26 for drunken driving and said nothing else will come out that could be used against him during the 2020 presidential campaign. O'Rourke told supporters Sunday that there's 'nothing' he hasn't already revealed about his past that could come back to hurt his run for office. The Washington Examiner reported that several high-profile Republicans came out against the tweet. An aide for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tweeted, 'If you think you're funny or clever by stereotyping and making fun of any race or nationality to score political points, you're an idiot, and you should probably not tweet.'""

THE RULEBOOK: LESSONS FROM THE PAST

""I have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this important portion of history; both because it teaches more than one lesson, and because, as a supplement to the outlines of the Achaean constitution, it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal bodies rather to anarchy among the members, than to tyranny in the head."" - Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Federalist No. 18

TIME OUT: WORDS REALLY ARE HARD

Smithsonian: ""'French fries' might not be on the menu if not for ancient farmers, and not because we can now grow plenty of potatoes, but because it would be harder to enunciate the f sounds needed to order them. The ability to make labiodental sounds -- which are sounds that require you to put your lower lip on your upper teeth, such as f and v sounds -- may not have fully developed until agriculture introduced softer foods to the human diet, changing our jaws, according to an intriguing and controversial study published [on March 14] in Science. Orthodontists know that overbite ... are common among people all over the world. But the study's authors assert that such jaw structures were rarer in the Paleolithic Period, when hunter-gatherer's rough diets demanded more force from teeth that met edge to edge. Agriculture softened our ancestors' diets with processed gruels, stews and yogurts, and this fare led to gradually shrinking lower jaws to produce today's overcrowded mouths.""

GILLIBRAND FORMALLY JOINS THE 2020 RACE

USA Today: ""New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand made official what already was well-known Sunday, formally joining the crowded Democratic field of candidates for president in 2020. 'I'm running for president,' she tweeted. 'Let's prove that brave wins.' Gillibrand, 52, made the announcement on Twitter with a two-and-a-half- minute campaign video titled 'The Brave.' She discusses 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and urges Americans in 'the home of the brave' to support her and her policies. Gillibrand talks about universal health care, family leave, an end to gun violence, the Green New Deal and campaign finance changes. The video concludes with the senator saying that each generation must answer the anthem's question, whether the brave will win. ... Gillibrand, one of six women in the Democratic field, launched an exploratory campaign in January. Recent polling of the field shows her garnering 1 percent or less of the vote - an important number because claiming 1 percent or more would qualify her for primary debates.""

Beto, Booker signal toward female VP picks - NYT: ""With a record number of female candidates running for president, some male Democratic contenders are signaling that a woman will be on their 2020 ticket -- just not at the top. Two male candidates, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, suggested this weekend that they would pick a woman as their vice president if they won the nomination. 'It would be very difficult not to select a woman, with so many extraordinary women who are running right now,' Mr. O'Rourke told reporters in Iowa on Saturday night. ... Announcing the demographic profile of a potential vice-presidential pick is highly unusual, especially more than 10 months before the first round of voting takes place in Iowa. The comments reflect a desire by male candidates to show that they are not taking female voters for granted, particularly as so many women mount bids of their own for the nomination. ... Issues of race and gender have already emerged as a central theme of the Democratic primary race...""

2020 Dems vocalize stance on expanding Supreme Court - Politico: ""After watching Mitch McConnell transform the judiciary over the past four years, liberals are demanding a bold response. And Democrats are listening. Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand told POLITICO they would not rule out expanding the Supreme Court if elected president, showcasing a new level of interest in the Democratic field on an issue that has until recently remained on the fringes of debate. The surprising openness from White House hopefuls along with other prominent Senate Democrats to making sweeping changes -- from adding seats to the high court to imposing term limits on judges and more -- comes as the party is eager to chip away at the GOP's growing advantage in the courts. ... Expanding the Supreme Court would amount to a historic power play by the next Democratic president and Congress, requiring an intense legislative fight and the abandonment of many judicial and congressional norms.""

HOGAN PITCHES HIMSELF AS A TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN

WaPo: ""Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan acknowledges that many Republicans nationwide who have heard about his potential presidential ambitions probably view him as a centrist with little hope of finding support in President Trump's GOP. But amid growing tensions between Trump and Republican lawmakers over foreign policy and the president's treatment of global alliances, Hogan is signaling that if he decides to wage an insurgent campaign for the GOP nomination, he would pitch himself as far more in tune with the party's long-held values and worldview than Trump. 'I come from the Ronald Reagan school of politics,' Hogan said last week in a wide-ranging interview at the state capitol, shaking his head in disapproval when asked whether he shares Trump's nationalism. He said groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a frequent target of Trump's ire, are 'critically important.' He expressed alarm about the way the president is 'not standing by or standing up for some of our allies,' and he poked fun at Trump's competence.""

POLL: AMERICANS' TRUST IN MUELLER IS DECREASING

USA Today: ""Amid signs that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference may be near its conclusion, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds that trust in Mueller has eroded and half of Americans agree with President Donald Trump's contention that he has been the victim of a 'witch hunt.' Support for the House of Representatives to seriously consider impeaching the president has dropped since last October by 10 percentage points, to 28 percent. Despite that, the survey shows a nation that remains skeptical of Trump's honesty and deeply divided by his leadership. A 52 percent majority say they have little or no trust in the president's denials that his 2016 campaign colluded with Moscow in the election that put him in the Oval Office. That number does reflect an improvement from previous polls. One year ago, 57 percent had little or no trust in his denials; in December, 59 percent did.

"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill. Getty Images

At least 49 people were killed in a mass shooting in two mosques in New Zealand on Friday. The perpetrator broadcast live footage of the shooting on Facebook.

Experts say thwarting this kind of social-media broadcast is difficult because of the lack of legal oversight, the invasive nature of technology and how people instinctively react to such images.

They often share such videos and become desensitized to the violence.

Rewind to April 2018. That's when Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill about the serious strides the social-media company was making to thwart the spread of hateful, violent content.

""We're developing AI tools that can identify certain classes of bad activity pro-actively and flag it for our team at Facebook,"" he told US Senators.

""Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the ISIS and al-Qaeda content that we take down on Facebook, our AI systems flag before any human sees it,"" he added. Facebook intended to put more than 20,000 people on security and content review, Zuckerberg said.

Fast forward to March 2019. On Friday, Facebook and other tech giants like Twitter and YouTube were under scrutiny because of what people saw and shared through their sites: The 17-minute livestreamed mass shooting, not to mention links to a manifesto apparently inspired by white nationalism.

The three social-media companies told MarketWatch they had taken down the content, suspended accounts, were working authorities and were on guard to remove further posts. Facebook ""quickly removed"" the video when New Zealand police alerted the company, a company spokeswoman said.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern tied the attack to people with ""extremist views,"" calling the shooting ""one of New Zealand's darkest days,"" adding, ""What has happened here is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.""

Violence broadcast online isn't unprecedented. Four people pleaded guilty to charges in connection to the livestreamed 2017 beating of a Chicago teen with special needs. A 74-year-old Cleveland man was shot dead in 2017 and then the murder was posted on Facebook. That year, BuzzFeed did its own count and said there were at least 45 times that violence was broadcasted over Facebook Live since its December 2015 start.

These sites insist they don't idly stand by, even with the sheer amount of posting and sharing that goes on. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all have posting policies, computers tasked with spotting and removing content in violation of their policies. Humans too -- a reportedly difficult job.

The companies will also kick off people who run afoul of their rules, like when Twitter banned now-convicted ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli and YouTube, Facebook and Twitter all booted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the creator of Infowars, from their platforms.

But like Friday, violent materials still surface sometimes. The question is how to clamp down.

""I don't think it's an impossible task. It's a hard task and it depends on the defaults we want to live with,"" said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor specializing in online free speech and privacy issues.

That could mean delays and filters to inspect content that was possibly violent or showing non-consensual sex, Citron said.

Zuckerberg recently announced Facebook's effort to build up user privacy. The company did not reply to a MarketWatch question if live streaming would be included in the shift towards more user privacy.

Legal liability

Months after Zuckerberg's trip to Washington DC, Facebook's lawyers urged federal appellate judges in Manhattan to affirm the dismissal of a case claiming the site enabled Hamas to fan anti-Semitic violence in Israel.

""Facebook empathizes with all victims of terrorism and takes steps every day to rid Facebook of terrorist content,"" court papers said. Still, the lawsuit was ""meritless,"" it said.

One of the company's arguments focused on the Communications Decency Act (CDA). Facebook said the law shielded it and similar service providers from what users put on the platform.

The case is pending.

When Twitter was unsuccessfully sued in San Francisco federal court over ISIS tweets, the company invoked the same law.

The case is being appealed.

The CDA wording ""is the absolute go-to defense and it is usually granted,"" Citron said. Tech companies have used it to fight off suits when all kinds of content spreads, from violence to hate speech to revenge porn, she said.

""We have the internet we have today because of it,"" Citron said.

Still, the prospect of more legal liability might make tech companies police their content more intensely, Citron said. If it was up to her, she'd keep companies immune from lawsuits on content so long as they showed ""reasonable practices"" to halt illegal content.

Robert Tolchin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Facebook and Twitter cases, said cases have wrongly built up protections for internet companies on the issue.

""It's taken on a life of its own,"" he said.

Technology gaps

Human moderators still play a major role in removing objectionable social-media content, said Jennifer Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.

""Automated approaches to understand video and images just aren't good enough to rely on at this point,"" Golbeck said.

She pointed to the issues websites have faced using algorithms to weed out pornography. Telling software to flag anything with nudity as pornography led companies to block content that wasn't problematic, such as breastfeeding or sexual-health education videos.

""Computers are so much better at understanding the meaning of words than images,"" Golbeck said. ""Words are defined, there are rules about how we put them together and there's a lot of examples of things other people have said that computers can learn from. Understanding what is in a picture, though, is very hard and understanding the context of that is even harder.""

Another issue is the regulatory grey area for images or videos showing violence or terrorism.

Companies like Facebook and YouTube have developed stronger algorithms to weed out content that they could be held liable for in a court of law, such as copyrighted materials and child pornography, said Kalev Leetaru, a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at Auburn University.

""Facebook actually faces real consequences if a Hollywood blockbuster is shared on their platform,"" he said. ""It's never going to face any consequences for having facilitated a live stream of terrorism.""

Politics also plays a role

Here's how Facebook's algorithm works: It compares potentially objectionable posts to a cache of content that has been deemed to represent terrorist or violent actions. But most of that content relates to acts from groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda.

As a result, Leetaru said, it can fall short of identifying acts of violence perpetrated by other terrorist groups such as Boko Haram or white supremacists.

Some violent imagery might be worth keeping out there, Leetaru argued. ""If it's a video of Venezuelan police opening fire on protestors, that stream of violence you may want to permit,"" he said.

Another complication: News organizations may also share articles or videos that contain stills from the violent videos. That's what some Australian outlets did with the Christchurch shooting.

An algorithm would similarly flag those, even though the content would be protected under freedom of press laws, Leetaru said.

Why people share such images

The jury's out on the psychology behind sharing images or videos of violence and atrocities. But it's clear people don't respond to this content in the same way they would in the real world, said Desmond Upton Patton, associate professor of social work at Columbia University. ""We have an ability to look with and engage with highly traumatic and violent content,"" he said.

""Technology provides a distance,"" Patton said. ""There is something that happens in the technology space to not feel and empathize with the trauma that they're seeing.""

Because people don't always have the same emotional reaction to this content when they view it on social media, they are more willing to share or re-tweet it, he added.

Research has long associated depictions of violence in electronic media with an increased propensity for aggressive or violent behavior. While evidence has not yet suggested the same link with social media, Patton said the disassociation people feel toward these platforms may promote violent activity.

""People feel freer to say or do things on social media that they would not say or do in reality,"" he said. ""Once those things have been articulated on social media, for some people it becomes a need to follow through because you've put it out there.""",247,New York Post,Has Facebook fixed anything in the year since Zuckerberg's Senate
"Former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile is Fox News' newest contributor, the network announced on Monday.

Brazile will offer political analysis on both Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, making her debut Monday on ""The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.""

DONNA BRAZILE: WHY I AM EXCITED TO JOIN FOX NEWS AND TAKE PART IN A CIVIL - AND SENSIBLE - DEBATE

""I'm delighted to be joining Fox News. I know I'm going to get criticized from my friends in the progressive movement for being on Fox News. My response is that, if we've learned anything from the 2016 election, it is that we can't have a country where we don't talk to those who disagree with our political views,"" Brazile said in a statement.

Brazile - a longtime Democratic strategist -- was the interim National Chair of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election and has served as chair of the DNC's Voting Rights Institute and was vice chair of the DNC's Civic Engagement and Voter Participation. She participated in every presidential campaign from 1976 through 2000 and will now bring her expertise to cable news.

""There's an audience on Fox News that doesn't hear enough from Democrats. We have to engage that audience and show Americans of every stripe what we stand for rather than retreat into our 'safe spaces' where we simply agree with each other. For there is no safety in self-limiting numbers,"" Brazile continued. ""You can be darn sure that I'm still going to be me on Fox News.

"""The situation at our Southern Border has gone from a crisis, to a national emergency, to a near system-wide meltdown,"" Nielsen said at Auburn University's Center for Cyber & Homeland Security. Her prepared speech said:

There is no more fundamental responsibility for a nation. And yet, the American people have been let down by our government again...and again. I want to cut through the politics to tell you loud and clear: there is NO ""manufactured"" crisis at our Southern Border. There is a real-life humanitarian and security catastrophe. Late last year, we were apprehending 50,000 - 60,000 migrants a month. Last month, we apprehended more than 75,000 -- the highest in over a decade. And today I can tell you that we are on track to interdict nearly 100,000 migrants this month ...

I say this with the utmost sincerity and urgency: the system is breaking. And our communities, our law enforcement personnel, and the migrants themselves are paying the price.

Congress needs to fix the problem, she said:

Because of outdated laws, misguided court decisions, and a massive backlog of cases, we are usually forced to release these groups into the United States. And we have virtually no hope of removing them in the future, despite the fact that the vast majority who apply for asylum do not qualify for it.

...

Our laws aren't keeping up with the migrant flows, and until they are fixed, the situation will only get worse and more heartbreaking. We need Congress to stop playing politics and do what's right.

We need Congress to change the law to allow us to keep families together throughout the immigration process ... to ensure the safe and prompt return of unaccompanied children to their home countries ... and to reverse the court ruling that directs dangerous criminals to be released into our communities.

This a complex and emotional issue. But no matter what side of the aisle you are on, we have common cause: to uphold our sovereign responsibility to secure our borders; to facilitate legal trade and travel; to prevent drugs from poisoning our communities, and to help vulnerable populations - all at the same time.

However, Democrats have united to block any legal reforms that would slow the migration of poor migrants across the border -- and GOP legislators have declined to get changes either by inflicting political pain on Democrats or by making political compromises with Democrats.

Nielsen also touted the border wall, saying:

DHS has built the first border wall to go up in a decade. We are building more, and have plans for hundreds of new miles to block illicit goods, illegal entry, and help ensure a safe and orderly migrant flow.

But Nielsen minimized mention of economics or business in the migration inflow, even though the migrants are hoping to find jobs in the United States, usually with companies which ignore the laws barring employment of illegal migrants.

The flow of money help to explain why GOP legislators did little to fix the border during the first two years of President Donald Trump's administration.

Nor did Nielsen mention the many visa programs which have created a domestic population of roughly 2 million white-collar professionals and blue-collar workers in the United States. This army of contingent workers is used by companies to hold down wages and salaries, despite President Donald Trump's avowed policy of ""Hire American.""

Nielsen agreed to take questions from Frank Cilluffo, director of the Center for Cyber & Homeland Security. His questions were generic softballs and yielded no insights.

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. The federal government then imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and it also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.

In 2019, because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts, the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 Central American laborers into the U.S. job market, even as at least 500,000 more migrants sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

Overall, in 2019, the U.S. government will allow at least two million new foreign workers into the United States to compete for the starter jobs sought by the latest wave of four million U.S. graduates. The new migrants also undermine the 24 million other Americans and the roughly three million legal immigrants who have joined the workforce since 2014.",249,Breitbart,DHS Nielsen: Border Security Is 'Near System-Wide Meltdown'
"50 percent of adults surveyed in an astonishing new USA Today/Suffolk University poll say that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation is a ""witch hunt"" and believe that President Trump has been the target of more investigative scrutiny than other presidents because of his politics.

The poll shows that trust in the president has increased as well. A majority of 52 percent still say they have little or no trust in Trump's insistence that his campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 campaign season, but that number is down from 59 percent in December.

Support for impeachment has faltered as well, with 62 percent saying the House should not impeach Trump compared to just 28 percent who want the lower chamber to seriously consider doing so. Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi came out against the idea last week, telling the Washington Post, ""Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country.""

Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Moscow is approaching the two-year mark, and recent reports have indicated that he is likely winding it down and preparing to submit a final report to Attorney General William Barr. His team has already indicted 34 individuals for a variety of crimes, including former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was sentenced to over seven years behind bars for bank and tax fraud and criminal conspiracy, and Trump's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who struck a plea deal with the special counsel and has been sentenced to three years in prison for financial crimes.",250,nationalreview.com,Poll: 50 Percent Say Mueller Investigation Is 'Witch Hunt' | National Review
"HUD regional administrator Lynne Patton reignited her Twitter feud with Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday, blasting him for hitting the presidential campaign trail before naming a permanent director of the city's embattled Housing Authority.

Under the deal that Patton's boss -- Housing Secretary Ben Carson -- struck with City Hall, de Blasio has until early April to select NYCHA's next board chairman from a list of candidates mutually-agreed to by Manhattan federal prosecutors, Carson's agency and City Hall.

""We're not auditioning for Lynne Patton's dream reality TV show,"" de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips shot back.

""The Mayor's focused on protecting NYCHA residents from the divestment and neglect of Ms. Patton and President Trump.""

Patton has repeatedly attacked de Blasio on Twitter in recent months -- including just before Carson and Hizzoner inked the January agreement, which imposed a new federal monitor over the embattled agency and ordered a shake-up of its management.

Federal prosecutors then dropped the bombshell lawsuit they brought in June 2018, which charged officials at NYCHA lied for years about conducting required lead inspections, schemed to hide deteriorating conditions from inspectors and failed to provide safe and decent housing to residents.

"I am excited by the opportunity to share my perspective and views with the Fox News audience and to help shape the dialogue at this important juncture in our history. More importantly, I'm eager to learn from the experience.

The 2020 presidential election is a consequential moment in American democracy. Everything we believe in as Americans will be examined and, in essence, ratified by our votes. But it concerns me, as it does the majority of good Americans, that our national debate has become hostile and disrespectful. We no longer simply agree to disagree. Too often we demonize the intentions of others. Our lines of communication are frayed, if not broken.

In order for us to best decide as a people how to better protect and preserve our way of life, we need to first be able to hear what others are saying without the filter of bias and contempt. Not until we once again become practiced at treating those of differing views with civility and respect can we begin to join together to solve the myriad of problems our country must overcome.

I fully admit that in my previous lives as a campaign staffer, presidential campaign manager and Democrat Party official, my own lack of civility in the heat of battle has been on full display. And it wasn't pretty. I should have been wise enough and humble enough to have listened to my mother, Jean, who so often would tell me, the third of nine children, to shut up and allow my siblings to speak, and to listen - really listen - to what they had to say. She knew I wasn't listening so much as I was pausing before launching again into an argument. My mother tried to teach us Brazile kids a lesson we all need to heed as citizens: Listen more, talk less. Be civil to one another. Find common ground. Contempt is hatred towards others. These are the lessons and the attitude I will bring to Fox News.

Will I agree with my fellow commentators at Fox News? Probably not. But I will listen. Will I question some of their assertions about hard-working Americans, low-income people and issues like climate change? Absolutely. But I will do so with civility and respect.

Feeling right and righteous is a comfortable place to be. In a bubble, you don't have to listen -- or even think. When we refuse to hear one another, we wall ourselves off from the possibility of learning and, more importantly, finding common ground. Civility and humility are vital to our democratic enterprise. They are even more vital in healing the political divisions tearing us apart. To bridge this great divide, we need to bust out of our comfort zone. In coming to work as a commentator at Fox News, trust me, I'm stepping out of my comfort zone. My beliefs will be challenged, and I welcome it.

In more than three decades in American politics, I have made my share of mistakes. Some would argue I've made more than my fair share. But I have never wavered on the values and principles that shaped my commitment to public service. When I was a little girl campaigning to get the city of Kenner, La., to put a playground in my neighborhood, I learned that civility with those who disagreed with me helped keep the dialogue alive. As long as we were still talking, I figured there was a chance for change. I got that playground.

I have always believed that what Americans share in common is a lot stronger than what drives us apart, and that the best decisions are made in the spirit of mutual respect. I have always had good friends on the other side of the aisle. Former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie and Michael Steele are men who I have known for decades. Former Bush-Cheney strategist and home girl Mary Matalin helped me survive so many challenges that we now refer to each other as ""Towanda,"" a term of endearment from the classic film ""Fried Green Tomatoes.""

Former Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock was the first person to donate clothes for my drive to help Hurricane Katrina victims. And I've happily shared many meals and civic engagements with Dana Perino and Karl Rove. My decision to serve as a commentator for Fox News is rooted in the belief that you cannot make progress, let alone reach compromise, without first listening to, and understanding those who disagree with you on critical issues.

"President Donald Trump tweets NBC, 'SNL; should be tested by courts. This comes after the shows Christmas parody sketch, which depicts a world where Hillary Clinton was elected president.

Donald Trump is taking his dislike for ""Saturday Night Live"" and its coverage of his administration to new heights with a fiery tweet that followed a rerun of the NBC sketch show over the weekend.

On Sunday, the president made his distaste for the political satire of ""SNL"" public once again by tweeting a scathing rebuke of its ""one sided media coverage."" In addition to lambasting the comedy series, he touched on what he perceives as unfairness in terms of its coverage of politics while also floating the idea that the comedy is colluding with Democrats to make him look bad and is eligible for an investigation by the FCC.

'SNL' SKETCH ASKS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF DONALD TRUMP WAS BLACK

""It's truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over & over, without so much of a mention of ""the other side."" Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows,"" he tweeted Sunday.

Trump continued in a follow-up tweet: ""Should Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this? There must be Collusion with the Democrats and, of course, Russia! Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News. Hard to believe I won and am winning. Approval Rating 52%, 93% with Republicans. Sorry! #MAGA.""

The episode that Trump was seemingly reacting to was a rerun of a Christmas-themed episode from Dec. 15 which featured a sketch in which Alec Baldwin, reprising his role as the show's go-to Trump impersonator, sees a world in which Republicans lost the 2016 election in the style of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

ALEC BALDWIN REPRISES DONALD TRUMP ON 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' IN 'DEAL OR NO DEAL: GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN EDITION' COLD OPEN

This isn't the first time that the president has discussed the idea of taking action against ""Saturday Night Live."" He previously took a shot at the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" sketch in December.

""A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC & Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can't be legal? Only defame & belittle! Collusion?"" he wrote at the time.

In February, he also called out ""SNL"" and hinted that its practices should be ""looked into.""

""Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!""

While it may seem that Trump is suggesting the FCC take action, he hasn't made any kind of formal move for the show to be investigated. This is likely due to the fact that the show's banner of comedy and satire largely makes it immune to the kind of investigation the president seems to be suggesting, as Entertainment Weekly reports. In his latest tweet, Trump is possibly referencing the equal time rule, which forces U.S. broadcast TV stations to give equal air-time to opposing political candidates. However, it's unclear if ""SNL"" could reasonably be subject to that rule.

"College admissions officer reveals parents bribe, cheat and lie 'all the time' to get their kids into schools

The college admissions scandal should be the populist issue of our time. Most of the talk in our politics about how ""the system is rigged"" is incredibly abstract and symbolic. But this is infuriatingly concrete.

On Tuesday, the Justice Department revealed a massive effort by wealthy parents and a shady ""admissions consultant"" to bribe and cheat their way into getting kids into a slew of elite schools.

LORI LOUGHLIN ONCE BRAGGED ABOUT MONEY SPENT ON DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE'S EDUCATION

Prosecutors say William Singer, the ringleader, sold two forms of services.

"John Oliver pointed out the hypocrisy in Jay Leno's recent calls for increased ""civility"" on late-night TV by airing jokes the former ""Tonight Show"" host made about Monica Lewinsky. (Getty)

The HBO host took aim at Leno's recent complaint about a perceived lack of ""civility"" from late-night hosts such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel amid the genre's heavily political climate.

""You know, everything now... everyone has to know your politics,"" Leno told the ""Today Show"" last week. ""I tried to use Johnny's model, and I would get hate mail from both sides equally and thought 'well that's fabulous, that's exactly what I want'.""

""But when people see you as one-sided, it makes it tough. And, you know, I did it when Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb, and it was just a little easier.""

EX-'TONIGHT SHOW' HOST JAY LENO SAYS LATE-NIGHT SHOWS TOO POLITICAL, MISSES 'CIVILITY'

He added: ""Now it's all very serious, I'd just like to see a bit of civility come back to it.""

Oliver didn't seem to appreciate the critique coming from Leno and took a shot at the former ""Tonight Show"" host during a segment about public shaming.

The 41-year-old comedian said he believes some good can come of public shaming, before admitting he himself has gone too far -- including a Monica Lewinsky joke he was part of during a 2008 episode of ""The Daily Show.""

Oliver admitted the bit was ""gross,"" before mentioning other comedians have since apologized for how they treated Lewinsky at the time.

He then turned his attention to Leno, who has not apologized for jokes he made about Lewinsky during her scandal.

""Many comedians have since expressed regret about things they have said her, although one who hasn't -- and was among the most relentless -- was Jay Leno,"" he said.

Oliver then showed a montage of old jokes Leno made about Lewinsky, including one about DNA samples and another about the former White House intern having ""sticky"" clothing.

""Those jokes have not dated well in any sense of the word. And they are pretty rough, especially coming from a guy who just this week complained about late night TV saying that he would like to see 'a bit of civility come back',"" the ""Last Week Tonight"" host said.

KIMMEL FIRES BACK AFTER TRUMP CALLS LATE-NIGHT SHOWS 'ONE-SIDED': 'STOP BEING TERRIBLE AND WE'LL STOP POINTING IT OUT'

""You know, like that time he did a bit with a fake book about Lewinsky titled 'The S--t in the Hat.' And if that's what he means by civility, may I offer my new book: 'Oh, the Places You Can Go F--- Yourself, Jay Leno!'""

Oliver's comments came after Leno wasn't the only person to bemoan the current state of late-night TV, with President Trump adding his own criticisms.

Trump fired off the latest salvo in his long-running late-night war last Thursday morning, attacking 'the three very and untalented' late-night hosts.

It is assumed the president was referring to Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, who both mocked him on their shows Wednesday night, and Jimmy Fallon.

One day earlier, the president slammed the ""very boring"" shows by picking up on comments made by former ""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno, who bemoaned how political the genre has become.

"The elected official getting most of the blame for Amazon's decision not to open a new headquarters in Queens is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, according to a poll released Monday.

The Siena College poll asked New York state voters who was the ""hero"", ""villain"" or ""role player"" in the Amazon debacle and Ocasio-Cortez led the pack.

Thirty-eight percent identified the freshman congresswoman as the biggest villain while only 12 percent called her a hero.

By comparison, 34 percent called local activists the chief villain; 29 percent Mayor de Blasio; 28 percent Gov. Cuomo; 26 percent Amazon itself; 21 percent the state Senate and 17 percent labor unions.

""Who do New Yorkers blame? Well, there's certainly blame enough to go around ... However, voters say the biggest villain was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez,"" said pollster Steven Greenberg.

""Amazon itself was seen as the biggest villain among Democrats, but Republicans and independents had Ocasio-Cortez as far and away the largest villain, followed by the local Queens activists.""

Voters overwhelmingly viewed Amazon's decision to back out of its deal as a blow to the state.

Sixty seven-percent said the withdrawal was ""bad"" for New York, while only 21 percent said it was ""good,"" the Siena College Poll found.

And by a two-to-one margin voters said they supported the agreement that would have allowed Amazon to receive $3 billion in government incentives in exchange for creating 25,000 jobs -- 61 percent in favor and 30 percent opposed.

""Clearly, jobs outweigh the cost of government incentives in the minds of most voters,"" Greenberg said.

Following the Amazon fiasco, more voters believe New York State government -- now completely controlled by Democrats in the governorship and Senate and Assembly -- is more hostile to business.

A staggering 67 percent of voters agreed with the statements that the current politics of state government is making it harder for businesses in New York to be successful, while only 26 percent disagreed. Even 53 percent of Democrats agreed with the statement.

Moreover, 51 percent of voters now believe New York is moving too far to the political left, while 36 percent disagreed.

"Launching his presidential campaign in Vanity Fair magazine last week, Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke explained his message this way: ""Every word was pulled out of me. Like, by some greater force, which was just the people there. Everything that I said, I was, like, watching myself, being like, 'How am I saying this stuff? Where is this coming from?'""

Where's it coming from Beto? Let me put it this way: Never American politics has there been a more appropriate launchpad for a presidential bid than your profile in Vanity Fair. And as a public service, we'll explain to America just how vain you are, why you have so little to be vain about and why that's dangerous for america.

Vanity is Beto's defining characteristic. He thinks we want to see him at the dentist. He thinks we want to know about the ""funk"" he was in after he lost his Senate race last year. He thinks we want to know everything about him - except his actual policies.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON.

Earlier this year, Beto released a digital ad attacking President Trump on immigration. ""It's not about people coming across the border,"" he said. ""It's about visa overstays.""

Ok, asked a reporter from the Washington Post. So what should be done about visa overstays? Beto literally answered, ""I don't know."" Last week, when asked about his health care policy, his answer was basically, I don't know.

But here's one thing Beto does know: Borders are not cool and must be taken down, man. Yeah ... take it down. And hey, let's take big money out of politics, too.

""I want to make sure that, again, we're not giving [money] away to corporations or special interests,"" Beto has said. ""That's what Senator Cruz would do, thanks to the contributions that he's received from those political action committees. He's working for the clampdown and the corporations and the special interests. He's not working for the people of Texas.""

""Working for the clampdown""? Oh my God ... quoting the Clash in a debate! He is trying so hard. But whatever. Look, it doesn't matter, because Beto is always working for the people. People like his wife Amy's father, billonaire property developer Bill Sanders.

So this is the cool new politics the Democrats are swooning over? A spoiled rich kid who wanted to run for daddy's office, who used daddy-in-law's money to get elected and then used his office to screw the poor and serve the rich - his own rich family? Good ol' Beto, born with a silver skateboard at his feet.

After his father-in-law helped launch Beto's political career on the El Paso City Council, Beto repaid the favor by campaigning aggressively for a new property development in the city. It would involve seizing land from low income Mexican-Americans so his billionaire father-in-law could build a superstore.

Beto's mother benefited from her son's political power, too. She was a shareholder in a web and software company he started after college. Beto's wife also joined the company in 2005 and ran it from the time he went to Congress in 2013 until she sold it in 2017. That would be fine, except Beto's political campaigns for the House and Senate have paid his own company over $125,000 since 2011.

So this is the cool new politics the Democrats are swooning over? A spoiled rich kid who wanted to run for daddy's office, who used daddy-in-law's money to get elected and then used his office to screw the poor and serve the rich - his own rich family? Good ol' Beto, born with a silver skateboard at his feet.

And the shameless hypocrisy continues. In his Senate campaign, Beto signed a ""no fossil fuel money pledge"" promising to reject campaign donations over $200 from fossil fuel companies and executives. But unbelievably, in the 2018 election cycle, Beto had the second highest total of donations from the oil and gas industry in all of Congress, including dozens directly from oil and gas executives.

And it gets worse. Pay close attention - the details you're about to hear have never been reported before.

In Congress, Beto served on the Armed Services Committee, and despite his bold denunciation of special interest corruption, it turns out he's up to his neck in it, with over $100,000 in donations from the defense industry between 2016 and 2018.

About $23,000 of that came from Lockheed Martin, one of the government's biggest defense contractors, as well as $19,000 from Raytheon, another enormous defense contractor. But a closer look reveals a number of even shadier conflict donors on top of that.

For example, Beto took $2,000 from Robert Marcus, a lobbyist for Signal Group assigned specifically to represent Arktis Detection Systems, a company that sells radiation detection technology and specifically markets itself for Homeland Security efforts on its website

Beto also took $1,000 from Christian Kierig, a lobbyist from Kadesh and Associates whose personal clients included Northrop Grumman, another massive defense contractor. And then another $1,000 from another defense lobbyist, Michael Smith from Cornerstone Government Affarirs, who represents Boeing.

And on and on it goes. Conflict donors coming out of those innocent wide eyes, and yet Beto rails against special interests and money in politics. What a snake!

But in the end, none of that - the corruption, the nepotism, the hypocrisy - none of that is dangerous. It's just like most politicians. There's a very specific reason I think Beto is dangerous, and I want to explain it to you clearly.

Take it from me as someone who has worked at the highest levels of government and politics. The most important thing about a candidate is not their promises - those hardly ever get delivered anyway. It's about how they would respond to unpredictable future events. And that's about their character.

Whatever else people knew about Donald Trump going into 2016, it was obvious he was strong. He said what he thought, no matter who it offended.

But Beto O'Rourke says whatever people want to hear. In his Senate campaign, he wanted the people of Texas to think he only cared about them, not higher office. He insisted he didn't want to run for president and put his family through more stress. What a modern guy! Putting his family first ... until his next career move, just a couple of months later, when he announces, with wife Amy at his side, that he's running for president.

This guy cannot be trusted. He tells people whatever they want to hear. He is transparently desperate to be liked, to be loved. His campaign song might as well be the Stone roses' ""I Wanna Be Adored.""

That's why he's dangerous. He's like a tree without roots; it cannot withstand the slightest pressure. Imagine him with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Beto wouldn't stand up to China. He would want Xi Jinping to like him. He'd just tell him what he wants to hear.

But before you dismiss Beto O'Rourke as a ludicrous joke, remember he is deadly serious about this. He's just told us his favorite book is ""The Hero's Journey."" He truly thinks of himself as a hero, sent to save America. Look what he said in his Vanity Fair interview: ""You can probably tell that I want to run. I do. I think I'd be good at it... Man, I'm just born to be in it.""

Wow. This is not a joke. This is a real danger for America.

And before the left starts screaming that this is some kind of Fox News hit piece on President Trump's potential opponents, let me remind you I have consistently praised Democratic presidential candidates, including literally last week, Elizabeth Warren. She at least is a serious person with a track record of fighting for working families.

Bernie Sanders is a serious person with a lifetime of consistent campaigning on principle. You may disagree with him, but he's obviously sincere. Kamala Harris is a serious person who as California attorney general tried to tackle tough social problems in a way that most conservatives would support. Even Cory Booker - I know, I know, ""Spartacus"" ...he's got convictions, too. I believe him when he says he wants to bring the country together. He's got a track record. As mayor of Newark, N.J., he backed school choice. He is a serious person.

But Beto - ridiculous, phony show pony Beto - he is not a serious person. He is a vain, narcissistic weirdo. His track record is nepotism and corruption. His principles are me, me. and me again. He must never be allowed anywhere near the White House.",259,Fox News,Steve Hilton: Why Beto O'Rourke is a real danger to America and must not be allowed near the White House
"Does congress have the two-thirds support they need to override Trump's veto?

With President Trump ¬≠simultaneously fighting much of his own party as well as Democrats, a Yogi Berra classic fits the occasion: ""It's deja vu all over again.""

More than two years into his presidency, Trump is once again at odds with most of Washington. The first veto of his presidency reflects his predicament, one of many perils he faces on the road to 2020.

TRUMP WAS RIGHT TO VETO RESOLUTION BLOCKING HIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION

The politics notwithstanding, the president is right to use executive power to find more funds for border barriers and security. To do otherwise would be to betray his promises to secure the border and his responsibility to protect America.

On the surface, his battle with Democrats and the 12 Republican Senators who voted against him is over the power of the purse. Congress won't give him the money he wants, so Trump aims to use other money with his emergency declaration. By vetoing the resolution that aimed to stop him, the president invites a court fight.

Yet despite the fact that Trump took his eye off the border-wall ¬≠issue for too long, his action now is justified by the surging streams of migrants crossing illegally. As Attorney General William Barr said at Friday's veto event, the combination of security concerns and the humanitarian crisis creates a ""clear and present danger"" to America.

"The college admissions scandal should be the populist issue of our time. Most of the talk in our politics about how ""the system is rigged"" is incredibly abstract and symbolic. But this is infuriatingly concrete.

On Tuesday, the Justice Department revealed a massive effort by wealthy parents and a shady ""admissions consultant"" to bribe and cheat their way into getting kids into a slew of elite schools.

Prosecutors say William Singer, the ringleader, sold two forms of services. For tens of thousands of dollars, parents could pay to have a proctor correct their incorrect answers as their kids took the SAT. Or they could pay hundreds of thousands to bribe coaches at elite schools to designate applicants as desired athletes, thus circumventing the minimum requirements for grades and test scores.

One California family allegedly paid $1.2 million to Singer, who in turn allegedly paid Rudy Meredith, the women's soccer coach at Yale, $400,000 to claim that the family's daughter was a coveted recruit even though she didn't play at all.

This scandal is a staggering indictment of higher education, and American education policy generally. Virtually every constituency in American life has good reason to be rankled.

Defenders of affirmative action are rightly livid about this effort, by mostly rich white people who already have every advantage imaginable, to game the system. Opponents of affirmative action who argue that merit alone should determine admissions have every reason to be outraged as well.

For both groups, and for everyone between the two extremes, the pressure to get kids into the best college possible -- and then figure out how to pay for it -- is a source of incredible anxiety.

But the scandal goes beyond just these issues. It's also a searing indictment of the value of an elite college education in the first place. None of these parents seemed remotely concerned about whether their kids could hack it once they got into their dream schools -- and rightly so.

In his book ""The Case Against Education,"" George Mason economics professor Bryan Caplan makes a compelling case that most of the value in diplomas from elite colleges isn't in the education they allegedly represent but in the cultural or social ""signaling"" they convey.

Imagine you're deposited on a desert island, forced to fend for yourself. Would you rather have the knowledge that comes with taking a survival training course, or just the piece of paper that says you took the course? Obviously, you'd rather know how to identify poisonous plants and sources of water than have a diploma that says you know how to do things you can't do. Now, ask yourself: Would you rather have the Yale education without the diploma, or the diploma without the education?

From an economic perspective, the piece of paper is vastly more valuable than the education, particularly in the humanities (and Caplan runs through the numbers to demonstrate this). The paper opens doors and gets you callbacks from employers and entr√©e into elite social circles where who you know matters more than what you know. The education might make you a better person, but the parchment is the ticket to opportunity. It's no guarantee of success, but it's a profound hedge against failure.

Parents know this, and parents without special advantages (wealth, fame, connections) resent it.

As a matter of public policy, the way we tell everyone they should go to college, even if it means incurring crushing debt, is a scandal.

College isn't for everyone, and it isn't necessary for many careers or vocations -- and shouldn't be necessary for many others.

If there's a maxim that should serve as a golden rule for policymakers, it's this: Complexity is a subsidy. The more complex we make a system, the more it rewards people with the resources (social, cognitive, political or financial) to navigate them. A system that rewards subjective priorities -- in the name of diversity, athletics, social justice, donations, preferences for legacy students, whatever -- creates opportunities for bureaucrats, parents and students to game the system.

You're never going to create a system where some parents won't do anything and everything to help their kids. All you can do is create a system that makes it more difficult to cheat or exploit loopholes. That requires clear, simple rules applicable to everyone.",262,New York Post,The college-admissions scandal should make everyone furious
"Nebraska GOP senator Ben Sasse has been lambasted by many of his Trump-skeptical fans in the conservative movement for voting Thursday to uphold the national emergency declared by President Trump.

A month ago, Sasse issued a statement, saying:

We absolutely have a crisis at the border, but as a Constitutional conservative I don't want a future Democratic President unilaterally rewriting gun laws or climate policy. If we get used to presidents just declaring an emergency any time they can't get what they want from Congress, it will be almost impossible to go back to a Constitutional system of checks and balances. Over the past decades, the legislative branch has given away too much power and the executive branch has taken too much power.

But on Thursday, he voted to uphold the emergency declaration, saying:

We have an obvious crisis at the border -- everyone who takes an honest look at the spiking drug and human trafficking numbers knows this -- and the President has a legal path to a rapid response under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA). I think that law is overly broad and I want to fix it, but at present Nancy Pelosi doesn't, so I am therefore voting against her politically motivated resolution. As a constitutional conservative, I believe that the NEA currently on the books should be narrowed considerably. That's why I'm an original sponsor of Senator Lee's legislation, and it is why I have repeatedly gone to the White House to seek support for NEA reform.

I urge both the Majority and Minority Leaders to assist in moving this legislation through committee and quickly to the Floor for debate, negotiation, and passage through the full Senate. If this Congress is serious in its concerns about decades of executive overreach, we will devote ourselves to systematically reclaiming powers Congress has been imprudently granting to presidents of both parties for far too long. Today's resolution doesn't fix anything because the root problem here can't be fixed with bare-knuckled politics but rather with a deliberate debate about the powers that Congress has been giving away and that the Executive has therefore claimed.

Sasse has not yet responded to an interview request from National Review, but a source close to the Nebraska senator provided a bit more detail about how he decided to vote to uphold the emergency.

In Sasse's view, Thursday's vote was a ""close call"" because he thinks there is a genuine emergency at the southern border and that the president has the legal authority under the National Emergencies Act to declare an emergency. ""Should a president have authorities this expansive? No, not in Ben's view,"" says the source close to Sasse. ""In his view, we should be tackling the underlying problem, not the symptom. Democrats have heard from many Republicans for weeks that we were willing to do that, but they didn't want to, because it weakened the political point they wanted against this president on this issue. The White House, on the other hand, was/is relatively open to these discussions.""

On Wednesday morning, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she'd oppose any deal brokered by Senator Mike Lee to change the National Emergencies Act while upholding Trump's recent emergency declaration. But so too did President Trump reject any such deal on Wednesday, and when that happened Lee decided to vote in favor of terminating the emergency.

Sasse's pointing the finger at Pelosi and arguing that the declaration was technically legal hasn't satisfied many of his conservative allies.

Did electoral politics play a role in Sasse's vote? Those close to him insist it didn't, but it was hard not to notice that every senator who is up for re-election in 2020 except for one (Maine's Susan Collins) sided with Trump. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, another senator up in 2020, recently wrote an op-ed opposing Trump's declaration, only to change his mind at the last minute to support it. One of the twelve GOP senators who voted to disapprove of Trump's declaration tells National Reviewthat he believes Sasse wanted to vote for the disapproval resolution but was in too much trouble with Trump's supporters already to do so.

On the other hand, what did Sasse really gain politically from Thursday's vote? ""I can't imagine one vote changes things too much for him"" regarding a 2020 primary challenger, says one source close to the Trump White House. ""Or changes the White House's view of him to any great extent.""

While it's not clear that the vote helps Sasse much with the president's supporters, it has left many of Sasse's allies disappointed. ""He worked really carefully through every single argument for and against,"" says another source close to Sasse. ""In some ways, unlike a lot of other senators, a 'yes' would have been the easy vote, but he did what he thought was correct.""",263,nationalreview.com,Why Did Ben Sasse Vote to Uphold the National Emergency? | National Review

According to the left-liberal Guardian, the letter reads: ""Almost a year ago, MPs from across the political spectrum united behind a common cause as they overwhelmingly voted to introduce a law that would help reunite refugee families.

""The current rules condemn child refugees fleeing conflict and persecution to live in the UK without their parents. It also prevents parents from bringing their children over the age of 18. At a time when refugees need their families the most, they are being forced to be without them indefinitely.

""They say a week is a long time in politics, but a year is a long time to wait. For refugee families it means a year of missed birthdays, Christmases, Mother's Days, Father's Days, and Eid.

""We cannot let the urgent crowd out the important. We urge you to use your power to stop the delays on this bill and allow it the necessary time to proceed and be debated.""

The proposed law, which is backed by a long list of open borders-supporting NGOs and international bodies including Amnesty International, the UNHCR, and Help Refugees, would change migration rules to expand the definition of family for reunification purposes, along with reintroducing taxpayer-funded legal aid to assist third world migrants in applying to have family members brought into the United Kingdom.

Critics argue the measures will encourage people in the Global South to send their children on dangerous journeys to Britain, as so-called unaccompanied minors who broke into Britain illegally would be allowed to import family members under the proposed rule changes.

Responding to the letter, a spokesman for the Home Office told the Guardian: ""We have always been clear that we support the principle of family unity and have reunited over 26,000 family members in the last five years.

""However, we also believe that we must not create perverse incentives for people, particularly children, to leave their families and risk dangerous journeys hoping relatives can join them later.""

Immigration minister Caroline Nokes previously argued that the bill was not in Britain's interests, noting that the Government had already enabled the reuniting of ""24,700 families in the past five years"" within the current system, in addition to spending more than a billion pounds of taxpayers' money on resettling refugees from Syria in the same period.

Denouncing the bill in The Times last year, she also pointed out that sponsor Angus MacNeil was ""calling for us to open our family reunion policy to allow refugees to bring many more extended family members to the UK then we currently allow -- regardless of whether they need protection, are living in conflict zones or had even formed a family unit before they left.""

Despite polls consistently showing a large majority of the country want to see immigration levels to Britain brought down, many MPs appear determined to ensure that the opposite happens.

Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported how cross-party MPs on the International Development Committee have demanded the country double the number of refugees it imports directly from the third world, and to expand the working rights of asylum seekers, despite multiple warnings from think tank Migration Watch that the latter policy would incentivise illegal economic migration.",264,Breitbart,MPs Demand UK Govt Speed Up Pro-Chain Migration Bill
"New questions surrounding the depth of the college admissions scandal

The celebrity college-admissions cheating scandal has two clear takeaways: an elite college degree has taken on wildly inflated importance in American society, and the sports-industrial complex enjoys wildly inflated power within universities.

Thirty-three moguls and TV stars allegedly paid admissions fixer William Singer a total of $25 million from 2011 to 2018 to doctor their children's high school resumes - sending students to private SAT and ACT testing sites through false disability claims, for example, where bought-off proctors would raise the students' scores.

WILLIAM H. MACY SAID HE'D GIVE DAUGHTERS WITH FELICITY HUFFMAN A 'LEG UP' BEFORE COLLEGE CHEATING SCANDAL

Singer forged athletic records, complete with altered photos showing the student playing sports in which he or she had little experience or competence. Corrupt sports directors would then recommend the student for admission, all the while knowing that they had no intention of playing on the school's team.

None of this could have happened if higher education had not itself become a corrupt institution, featuring low classroom demands, no core knowledge acquisition, low grading standards, fashionable (but society-destroying) left-wing activism, luxury-hotel amenities, endless partying, and huge expense.

Students often learn virtually nothing during their college years, as University of California, Irvine, education school dean Richard Arum writes in ""Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses."" They may even lose that pittance of knowledge with which they entered college.

Seniors at Princeton, Yale, Cornell, Duke and Berkeley scored lower in an undemanding test of American history than they did as freshmen, according to a 2007 study commissioned by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.

College is only desultorily about knowledge acquisition, at least outside of the STEM fields (and even those fields are under assault from identity politics).

Teen Instagram star and product-placement phenom Olivia Jade Giannulli, the daughter of actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Massimo Giannulli, and apparently an unwitting recipient of Singer's services, spoke for millions of college freshmen when she admitted on a YouTube video last August: ""I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.""

Giannulli was funneled into the University of Southern California via her mother's $500,000 purchase of fake records and a photo-shopped image portraying her as a promising addition to the USC rowing team. She was looking forward to the campus parties and football games, she told her 2 million YouTube followers - at least to the extent that such extracurricular activities didn't interfere with her lucrative product-promotion business.

So what is college about? Primarily, it is about accrediting its graduates and signaling - as Bryan Caplan argues in ""The Case Against Education"" - their value to future employers as responsible workers.

One solution is to expose the myth that a college credential is the prerequisite to a productive, fulfilling life.

The stampede to get children into as prestigious a school as possible grows more frenzied by the year, driven by the bragging rights that association with a name-brand university confers on status-hungry parents, who also understand the networking potential of those bright college years.

There's the allegiances of alumni, too, whose donations flow more lavishly when their alma mater's sports teams are winning. Such tribal sympathies confer unjustified admissions authority on college athletics directors. When the sleazy sports directors in the Singer scheme certified the student applicants as varsity material, their word was apparently final in admissions offices.

What the pay-to-play admissions scam does not demonstrate, however, is that ""legacy"" admissions are somehow more corrupt than race-based affirmative-action admission policies - which seems to be the primary lesson that left-wing commentators and politicians are taking from the scandal - or that meritocracy is a ""myth"" that has now been debunked.

Racial preferences are a far more significant deviation from academic meritocracy than legacy preferences, which are not even implicated in the current scandal. An underreported but salient detail in the Singer scam is that he ""falsified students' ethnicities,"" according to the New York Times, because ""some families and students perceive their racial backgrounds can hurt or aid their chances of getting in to schools that consider race in their admissions decisions."" This is not a mere perception; it is the truth.

The claim that blacks are disadvantaged in college admissions, especially compared with legacies, is false. At Middlebury, the admission rate of legacies in the class of 2006 was 45 percent, compared with 27 percent for the entire class, according to the New York Times.

But the 30 legacies admitted were also more academically qualified, with an average SAT score of 1,389, 33 points higher than the class average. By contrast, nearly 60 percent of all black and Hispanic applicants were admitted.

Though the Times did not report their average SAT scores, it is a virtual certainty, given unbroken national patterns, that they were roughly a standard deviation below the class average.

At Harvard, legacies are better candidates on average than other students, Harvard's Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons said in a 2011 interview. Nevertheless, blacks get a bigger boost than legacies, despite lower academic scores. In fact, the boost from being black is so strong that Harvard limits the contributions of non-race factors to a black applicant's composite admissions rating.

Just being black quadruples your chances of admission to Harvard. The university claims that if race were not a factor, then the percentage of blacks at the school would fall to 0.6 percent, compared with the current 14 percent. The Asian share of the student body would be at least 43 percent, by Harvard's own estimate, compared with 18 percent, if race were removed from the admissions equation.

Singer told another parent involved in the scandal, Gordon Caplan, co-chairman of elite law firm Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, that ""institutional advancement"" (i.e., connections and donations) is ""no guarantee"" of admission. The admissions officers are ""just gonna give you a second look,"" he said.

Artificially boosting test scores is a better bet, and racial preferences provide the greatest test-score assist. Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor summarize the data in their book, ""Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's Intended To Help, And Why Universities Won't Admit It.""

The University of Michigan in 2003 gave racial minorities 20 extra admission points; legacies got four extra points. A 1990 federal investigation of Harvard's admission practices found that the SAT scores of legacies were 120 points above those of black students admitted.

Eliminating racial preferences at Harvard (and elsewhere) would have a far greater effect on increasing admission slots for qualified Asians than eliminating legacy admissions, according to Duke economist Peter Arcidiacono, the plaintiffs' expert witness in the recently concluded Harvard racial-preferences trial, which focused on Harvard's anti-Asian admissions penalty.

Colleges should return to their true function: passing on, from one generation to the next, the inheritance of Western civilization.

On average, Asians admitted from 2010 to 2015 at Harvard outperformed admitted blacks on the SAT by 218 points (admitted whites outperformed admitted blacks by 193 points). Test scores and GPA that would give an Asian only a 25 percent chance of admission at Harvard would be a virtual admissions guarantee -- 95 percent -- for a black student.

To be sure, legacy preferences and racial preferences should both be eliminated. Colleges should adopt a transparent, purely merit-based admissions system based on quantified tests of academic preparedness. Such a system would guarantee that entering freshmen were all equally prepared to compete academically, and would have the additional benefit of putting most college admissions officers out of a job.

These self-important bureaucrats view themselves as artistes, using their exquisite insights into character to curate a utopian community of ""diverse"" individuals. The Harvard racial-preferences trial put such airs on nauseating display. In fact, admissions officers are simply allocating a scarce resource based on their own prejudices and inclinations.

The unquenchable desire of college admissions officers to engineer racial diversity led to a cheating scandal far more consequential than this one. Michael Landry and his wife ran a vaunted college prep school in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, that subjected its students to sadistic physical abuse and emotional humiliation, while inventing their college credentials out of whole cloth.

The transcripts that Landry fabricated adopted every trope of the ""holistic"" admissions process used to override the admissions standards applied to most Asian and white applicants. One such transcript referred to a ""bright, energetic, compassionate and genuinely well-rounded"" student, whose alcoholic father had beaten his mother and him while denying them money for food and shelter. The student had allegedly founded a community-service program to help the children of abusive and alcoholic parents.

All this was as much of a fiction as his high school GPA and test scores, as the New York Times reported. Landry students attended no classes, and they were trained to demonstrate complicated math problems on the chalkboard by rote for the benefit of visitors. America's big-hearted desire to close the persistent racial-achievement gap made the Landry school a magnet for hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions, especially from small donors, as videos of its students getting acceptance letters from Harvard, Wesleyan, and other elite schools went viral.

Many of the school's graduates experienced psychological difficulties at their colleges, since their academic skills were woefully deficient, and they could not keep up with their classmates. Their anguish was only a subset, though, of the emotional malaise inflicted on racial-preference beneficiaries more generally by academic mismatch. It is not surprising that a standard item in the diversity demands regularly generated by ""underrepresented minority"" students is for a beefed-up mental-health bureaucracy.

The power conferred on college-admissions officers by America's ever-more frenzied pursuit of college diplomas made the corruption revealed in this recent federal indictment inevitable. One solution is to expose the myth that a college credential is the prerequisite to a productive, fulfilling life. As Manhattan Institute fellow Oren Cass explains in ""The Once and Future Worker,"" America's education problem is not that too few students are going to college, but that too many are.

One easy solution to the college-debt crisis would be to stop encouraging so many people to go to college in the first place.

Colleges should return to their true function: passing on, from one generation to the next, the inheritance of Western civilization.

"Brookings Senior Fellow and author Robert Kagan in March 2018. (Brookings Institution/Paul Morigi)

Of all the geopolitical transformations confronting the liberal democratic world these days, the one for which we are least prepared is the ideological and strategic resurgence of authoritarianism. We are not used to thinking of authoritarianism as a distinct worldview that offers a real alternative to liberalism.

We are not used to thinking of authoritarianism as a distinct worldview because it isn't one. All authoritarian states share certain things in common, and they may see some of the same things as threats, but there isn't a single worldview that all authoritarian governments subscribe to. There is no one ideology that binds them together. Most of them are nationalistic to one degree or another, but because of that they usually have competing and opposing goals. Treating all authoritarian regimes as part of the same global threat lumps illiberal and majoritarian democracies together with kleptocracies, communist dictatorships, and absolute monarchies. That exaggerates the danger that these regimes pose, and it tries to invent a Cold War-like division between rival camps that doesn't really exist. If the U.S. treats these states as if they are all in league with one another, it will tend to drive together states that would otherwise remain at odds and keep each other at arm's length.

Kagan's preferred foreign policy requires that there is some global ""ideological confrontation"" for the U.S. to be engaged in. If there isn't one, it has to be invented. His account of the history of the 20th century shows how determined he is to see international politics in terms of grand ideological battles even when there wasn't one. He takes seriously the idea that WWI is one of these struggles: ""But for those who fought it, on both sides, it was very much a war between liberalism and authoritarianism."" Kagan makes the mistake of treating wartime propaganda descriptions of the war as the real motivation for the war, and he relies on stereotypes of the nations on the other side of the war as well. The world's largest colonial empires were not fighting for ""the liberties of Europe"" and they certainly weren't fighting for the rights of small nations, as wartime British propaganda would have it, and that became abundantly clear in the post-war settlement. It was primarily a war among empires for supremacy in Europe, and the surviving Allied empires consolidated their hold on their own colonial possessions and gained more. To the extent that Americans genuinely believed that joining the war had something to do with vindicating the cause of democracy, they were quickly disabused of that notion when they saw the fruits of the vindictive settlement that their allies imposed on the losing side.

Kagan admits that there are many differences of regime type that he is trying to collapse into one group:

We have become lost in endless categorizations, viewing each type of non-liberal government as unique and unrelated to the others -- the illiberal democracy, the ""liberal"" or ""liberalizing"" autocracy, the ""competitive"" and ""hybrid"" authoritarianism. These different categories certainly describe the myriad ways non-liberal societies may be governed. But in the most fundamental way, all of this is beside the point.

In other words, Kagan isn't all that interested in details or accuracy. Those are ""beside the point."" What matters is dividing up the world into two opposing camps: ""Nations are either liberal, meaning that there are permanent institutions and unchanging norms that protect the ""unalienable"" rights of individuals against all who would infringe on those rights, whether the state or the majority; or they are not liberal."" The criteria for qualifying as a liberal nation are extremely demanding. What institutions can honestly be called ""permanent"" and what norms are ever truly ""unchanging""? Judged against this extreme and unreasonable standard, there won't ever be many nations that qualify as liberal, including quite a few that we would normally consider liberal democracies in good standing. That makes it a lot easier for Kagan to exaggerate the power of ""resurgent authoritarianism.""

Kagan doesn't make it explicit in this essay, but his larger goal in all of this is to advocate for a more confrontational foreign policy mobilized against the authoritarian enemies that he has described. He hints at this when he disparages contemporary ""realists"" whom he doesn't name or cite:

Just as during the 1930s, when realists such as Robert Taft assured Americans that their lives would be undisturbed by the collapse of democracy in Europe and the triumph of authoritarianism in Asia, so we have realists today insisting that we pull back from confronting the great authoritarian powers rising in Eurasia.

To be much more accurate, there are realists, non-interventionists, and progressives that see no compelling reason for the U.S. to engage in destructive rivalries with major authoritarian powers in their own backyards. Except for a lame, overused comparison to the 1930s, Kagan doesn't even try to explain why we are wrong to think this. Kagan assumes that such destructive rivalries are both necessary and desirable, and this essay is the latest part of his effort to lay the groundwork for the ideological justification for those rivalries.

Kagan's analysis suffers from the problem of mirror-imaging that always plagues ideologues. He assumes that everyone sees the world in starkly ideological categories just as he does, and he thinks that other actors are just as determined to export their ideology as he is. His entire worldview depends on linking great power competition with larger ideological causes, and for almost thirty years there has been no such ""ideological confrontation"" for Kagan to theorize about. Despite Kagan's insistence to the contrary, there still isn't. He wants the U.S. to take a more confrontational approach to dealing with Russia and China, and in order to sell that today he has to dress it up as something more than the destructive and costly pursuit of hegemony that he has been pushing for decades. The U.S. has spent the last twenty years fighting wars that Kagan and other like-minded interventionists advocated for and endorsed. We shouldn't make the same mistake again when the stakes are even higher.",266,The American Conservative,The U.S. Shouldn't Seek New 'Ideological Confrontations' Abroad
"""It was a different time when (Leno) was hosting. Now there's one subject, so people can see your politics more, but I'm fine with that,"" Stephen Colbert said during an appearance at Paleyfest, according to Variety.

""I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I don't think there's anything wrong with saying what this person is doing to families and the nation is horrible,"" he added.

"WASHINGTON -- New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand formally joined the 2020 White House race on Sunday and previewed the hard line she will take against President Donald Trump by announcing a rally outside one of his signature Manhattan properties.

She had spent more than a month traveling around the country to gauge support for a run.

Her announcement that she was joining the dozen-plus candidates who want to challenge Trump came in a nearly three-minute video produced by her campaign and released early in the morning. She says the national anthem poses this question: ""Will brave win?""

""Well, it hasn't always, and it isn't right now,"" she says. ""Brave doesn't pit people against each other. Brave doesn't put money over lives. Brave doesn't spread hate. Cloud truth. Build a wall. That's what fear does.""

In the video, Gillibrand says that the country needs a leader who ""makes bold, brave choices"" and ""someone who isn't afraid of progress. That's why I'm running for president.""

She said her debut speech as a candidate will come next Sunday in front of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in New York.

Gillibrand has been one of the most forceful critics of the Trump administration. Using the backdrop of one of Trump's marquee properties is a clear challenge to the president.

She announced her exploratory committee in January in an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" Since then, she has visited a number of states to assess political support for a White House bid.

This coming week she plans to campaign in Michigan, Iowa and Nevada, leading up to her New York kickoff.

GILLIBRAND HITS TRUMP OVER WHITE NATIONALISM COMMENTS

The move comes two months after Gillibrand set up a presidential exploratory committee -- which allowed her to raise money and build a campaign structure -- and began introducing herself to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - three of the four states that kick off the primary and caucus calendar - as well as California and Texas, which hold contests immediately after the early voting states.

In her video - titled ""Brave Wins"" - the senator uses ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" to say that bravery has been a constant choice in the nation's history, and so many Americans have chosen to be brave.

Gillibrand also takes aim at President Trump, claiming the Republican has promoted an ""agenda of cowardice, hate and fear.""

""Brave doesn't pit people against each other. Brave doesn't put money over lives. Brave doesn't spread hate. Cloud truth.

""Build a wall. That's what fear does,"" she charges in the video.

BETO O'ROURKE PITCHES OVERHAUL OF SUPREME COURT

Gillibrand says that if America could land astronauts on the moon, ""we can definitely achieve universal health care. We can provide paid family leave for all, end gun violence, pass a Green New Deal, get money out of politics and take back our democracy.""

Her announcement comes one day after Gillibrand wrapped up her third trip this year to New Hampshire, which holds the first primary in the race for the White House.

On Monday, Gillibrand heads to Michigan to join Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for a public event with a local women's group, Fems for Dems. She'll also hold a town hall. On Tuesday, Gillibrand heads to Iowa - which votes first in the presidential nominating calendar -- and later in the week makes a trip to Nevada, which is the first western state to vote.

Next Sunday, Gillibrand plans to give a speech outside the Trump International Hotel in New York City.

WHICH 2020 DEMOCRATS ARE STILL ON THE FENCE

With her declaration, Gillibrand becomes the 14th major Democrat to officially launch a presidential campaign. She joins fellow Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, former San Antonio mayor and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas have also declared their candidacies. So have Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Rep.

In her video, she touted taking ""on the Pentagon to end sexual assault in the military.""

But a sexual harassment issue in Gillibrand's own Senate office is now making headlines, with the reporting that a female aide in her mid-20s who was working in Gillibrand's office resigned in protest last summer as she criticized the office's handling of her sexual harassment complaint against a senior male adviser to the senator.

"Two kinds of opportunism are at play against the gun manufacturer: financial and political.

Rule No. 1 of tort law: The bad guy is the one with the most money to pay you.

On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza murdered 26 people, 20 of them schoolchildren ages six and seven.

Lanza killed himself, too. Can't sue him.

Lanza had a history of mental illness -- a long one. He'd been treated under the New Hampshire ""Birth to Three"" program and later by the Yale Child Study Center. But it would be hard to make a case against those institutions, which enjoy a great deal more sympathy than gun manufacturers do. The schools couldn't handle Lanza, either, and he was left to the care of his mother, Nancy, who seems to have been a bit of an oddball herself and an enabler. But he murdered her, too, so she's not around to sue.

Nancy Lanza liked guns, and had a few, which is how Adam Lanza armed himself with the semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle he used in the massacre.

Bushmaster was a firearms maker founded in Maine in 1976. It changed owners a couple of times and ended up as part of the Freedom Group, a firearms conglomerate owned by Cerberus Capital, a private-equity firm, at the time of the massacre. Freedom ended up becoming the Remington Outdoor Company as part of a bankruptcy reorganization completed last year. Cerberus announced it was unloading its firearms businesses after Sandy Hook (under pressure from institutional investors, notably the California teachers' retirement fund), but that proved easier said than done. Cerberus ended up largely ceding control of the debt-ridden company to creditors, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan Chase prominent among them. In July 2018, Remington rejected a $500 million buyout. It gets complicated, but the lawsuit against the thing called ""Remington"" is in effect a lawsuit against the deep-pocketed financiers associated with it.

That's who you sue.

The lawsuit against Remington alleges that the company's marketing practices contributed to the Sandy Hook massacre. ""Remington may never have known Adam Lanza, but they had been courting him for years,"" a lawyer for the plaintiffs said. But it is not clear that Remington courted Lanza at all -- and it is quite clear that the company never courted him successfully, inasmuch as he stole the Bushmaster rifle he used in the crimes from his mother, whom he murdered. Connecticut has a law against ""unfair trade practices,"" which is a very odd way of looking at a mass murder.

So, in sum: Remington's private-equity owners acquired Bushmaster and formed a new company. That company sold a rifle to a distributor, which in turn sold it to a federally licensed gun dealership, which in turned sold it -- legally -- to Adam Lanza's mother. She was murdered, and her rifle was used in a horrifying massacre . . . and . . . if you squint . . . this somehow leads back to the marketing department at Remington, which advertised the Bushmaster rifle as a cousin to the standard-issue U.S. military rifle, which it is.

The lawsuit against Remington is bogus. It has little to do with Connecticut commercial law and everything to do with a substantive gun-control agenda and the opportunistic inclination to wring money from institutions that have a great deal of it. From the opinion of the state supreme court:

The gravamen of the plaintiffs' complaint was that the defendants negligently entrusted to civilian consumers an assault rifle that is suitable for use only by military and law enforcement personnel and violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) (¬ß 42-110a et seq.) through the sale or wrongful marketing of the rifle. The plaintiffs' first theory of liability was that the rifle is a military grade weapon that is grossly ill-suited for legitimate civilian purposes such as self-defense or recreation, that the rifle and other similar semiautomatic weapons have become the weapon of choice for mass shootings and, therefore, that the risks associated with selling the rifle to the civilian market far outweigh any potential benefits, that the defendants continued to sell the rifle despite their knowledge of these facts, and that it therefore was negligent and an unfair trade practice under CUTPA for the defendants to sell the weapon, knowing that it eventually would be purchased by a civilian customer who might share it with other civilian users.

This is another way of saying that Remington's owners are being sued for failing to concur with the substantive political views of gun-control advocates, i.e. that the weapon in question is ""ill-suited for legitimate civilian purposes such as self-defense or recreation,"" a claim that, it is worth noting, is false on its face inasmuch as semiautomatic rifles are proven instruments of self-defense and by far the most popular recreational firearms in the United States.

The use of commercial litigation and regulatory law to achieve progressive political goals is by now familiar: If an oil company opposes global-warming initiatives, that isn't politics but ""securities fraud,"" as far as Democrats are concerned; if conservative activists want to show a film critical of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the lead-up to a presidential election, that isn't politics but a ""campaign-finance violation,"" as far as Democrats are concerned.

This lawsuit happens against the background of progressive demands that certain political views be criminalized.

There are two kinds of opportunism at work here: One is purely financial, the prospect of getting a big payday that sets the stage for additional big paydays in the future as the ghouls go from manufacturer to manufacturer and crime scene to crime scene collecting billions of dollars as they go. The second is political opportunism, the attempt to establish the precedent that failing to go along with the progressive political agenda makes one an enemy of the state, subject to political sanction and criminal prosecution.

"I don't always agree with British philosopher John Gray, but even when I disagree, he makes me re-examine my own thinking, no bad thing.

The same is true of his new article in the New Statesman on Brexit, a project bedeviled both by the romanticism and sometimes willful delusion of some of its devotees and the smug technocratic disdain (the latter made worse by snobbery) of some of its opponents, a number of whom have also become detached from reason.

As Gray puts it:

For uber-Remainers, there has never been any question of compromise. For them the EU is a higher form of government, which it could never be rational to leave. They think of themselves as embodiments of reason, facing down the ignorant passions of the unwashed rabble. But their rationalism is a vehicle for a dangerous myth, in which the EU is a semi-sacred institution rather than a failing political experiment.

I have no firm view on how the forever shifting Brexit drama will unfold in the next week or so, but it's worth remembering that if nothing is agreed (and agreed in a manner acceptable to the EU) then Britain will (unless an extension is agreed with the EU) crash out of the union on March 29. If it does, the British economy won't collapse (although Gray is right to note the fragility of some of the foundations on which that assumption rests), but a sustained period of disruption will ensue. And, even if that's all that happens, those disruptions -- big and small -- will enter British political memory in such a way as to ensure (in my view; Gray has an intriguingly different take) that Britain's next government will be dominated by a Labour Party controlled by the hard left. And if Americans don't think that matters, they should consider what that will mean for NATO.

Contrary to the jeers of centrists, the soft left and the irredeemably complacent Tories, Labour's hard left (led nominally by Corbyn, a useful idol, but controlled by an infinitely smarter coterie) has played the Brexit mess to something close to perfection.

Gray:

The trouble with rationalism in politics is that it consistently misreads political realities. Consider the outrage that surrounds Jeremy Corbyn's continuing equivocations on a second referendum. There is nothing surprising in his ambivalence. Aside from his well-known Eurosceptic leanings, Labour's ambiguities have been highly effective as an electoral strategy. In 2017, the party pulled off the trick of standing on a manifesto promising to honour the referendum result that kept its working-class Leave supporters on side while encouraging legions of middle-class graduates to believe that the party endorsed Remain. Close observers have long recognised this as an exercise in what Russians call vranyo - the practice of telling lies that no one will believe. In this case, however, large numbers - citing a procedural motion passed at the last party conference - were eager to swallow the deception.

My guess is that this strategy will continue to work (Gray seems more skeptical).

Towards the end of Gray's piece, in which I was pleased to see his recognition (however grudging) that a ""Norway-style relationship...may, at this point, be the most reasonable way forward"", he returns to the topic of the ""Uber-Remainers"":

[Those]who seek shelter in the imagined safety of the EU are not living in the real world. In this they are like the established political classes in every Western country. There is nothing singularly British in the failure to understand the present. Screening out the continuing disintegration of the post-Cold War order is the response of liberal elites everywhere. All of them act on the assumption that the turn to authoritarianism is an anomaly, which must eventually be followed by reversion to liberal normalcy.

In fact, as John Maynard Keynes noted... it is a liberal order that is historically anomalous. Addressing a Bloomsbury audience in 1938, he mocked the faith in human rationality that he shared with much of his generation at Cambridge in the years before the First World War. ""This pseudo-rational view of human nature,"" Keynes declared ""led to a thinness, a superficiality, not only of judgement, but also of feeling... The attribution of rationality to human nature, instead of enriching it, now seems to me to have impoverished it.""

There's a reason that we are, as a species, so susceptible to illusion.

Gray:

Keynes renounced his youthful faith in reason after watching Europe's slide into chaos and barbarism following the botched Versailles peace conference in 1919. Securing a decent modicum of civilisation today requires an unflinchingly realist view of the deciding forces of politics, not blind faith in floundering liberal utopias.

There is no right side of history.

Gray concludes by observing how Keynes compared his generation to ""water-spiders, gracefully skimming, as light and reasonable as air, the surface of the stream without any contact at all with the eddies and currents beneath"". ""Today"", writes Gray, ""a new generation of water-spiders is skimming the surface, and it cannot be long before it is clear where the currents beneath are flowing.""",272,nationalreview.com,John Gray and the Brexit Follies | National Review
"Howard Kurtz: Beto has the sizzle, but is that enough to win the nomination?

Betomania is a lot like Beatlemania - except instead of teenage girls in the 1960s, journalists are now the ones swooning for their star.

If the Beatles were around today to sing about media infatuation with newly announced Democratic presidential hopeful Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke, their song would be titled ""They love him, yeah, yeah, yeah.""

O'Rourke is a skateboarding mix of rock 'n' roll (he was in a punk band named Foss), lefty politics, dictatorial ambition and media adoration. Wrap it up in a hip social media package with a logo ripped off from Whataburger Spicy Ketchup (I'm not joking) and, voila, you have the perfect creation.

MEDIA'S BETOMANIA BOOSTS O'ROURKE, MAGAZINE COVER BOY, FOR 2020

Meet the new JFK/RFK candidate for a media that's desperate for a return trip to Camelot (even if his hands operate independently from his body).

We saw this all before when Bobby Frank, aka Beto, ran and lost against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas last year. ABC reporter Paula Faris called O'Rourke a ""rock star,"" underlining it by saying, ""No, you really are!""

The media will be sad if Beto loses, but they'll adapt. Journalists will fall in love with whoever Democrats nominate for president.

Well, Beto is back and so is Faris, which takes us to the five moments the media would rather we forget:

The Crush, Part II: This time around, Faris isn't the worst. But she earned her status as president of the Beto Fan Club, so she's first. Faris hyped Beto's entry into the presidential race, noting, ""He's sat down with Oprah, posed for Vanity Fair."" He even spoke to voters, in Iowa, of all places! OMG! Oprah! Faris then asked: ""Can hope, change, and unity beat Trump?"" Isn't it nice to see reporters create marketing slogans for the candidates they cover? Bless her heart.

Vanity, yes. Fair? Hardly.: Vanity Fair's team of writer Joe Hagan and star photographer Annie Leibovitz kicked off the magazine's Beto-max April issue. It included more than 8,600 treacly and adoring words. Hagan just loved Beto's ""aura"" and ""preternatural ease."" And we learned vitally important information. Beto curses! He has Bob Dylan's memoirs, as well as genuine LPs from the Clash and Nina Simone. He has actual books and biographies. (Hagan wrote a biography of Rolling Stone's Jan Wenner. He must have fainted at the sight.) Hagan called Beto ""a candidate of honesty and basic decency, √† la Jimmy Carter."" Here's why journalists love him: ""Beto O'Rourke is quintessentially Generation X, weaned on 'Star Wars' and punk rock and priding himself on authenticity over showmanship and a healthy skepticism of the mainstream."" They don't believe it, but they want you to.

Finding his superstar: Hagan went on MSNBC to rave about Beto and his ""charisma"" - and the star-struck journalist may have outdone Faris. He talked about Beto's sense of ""destiny"" and how he has ""that gleam in his eye."" Then he revealed that Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith gave O'Rourke an even greater compliment. Hagan quoted Smith as saying that seeing O'Rourke ""in front of people"" is ""like a 'Jesus Christ Superstar.'"" Yep, journalists thinking a politician is like Jesus. But remember, journalists aren't in a cult.

Van on the run: Sometimes liberal news coverage is so ridiculous that late-night TV comedians have to make fun of it. ""Late Night"" host Seth Meyers on NBC made maximum sport out of MSNBC's obsession with Beto's minivan. Correspondent Vaughn Hillyard actually asked Beto, ""where is the rental car from?"" Meyers mocked in response: ""Wow, hard-hitting stuff, you guys."" Myers then launched into possible follow-up questions: ""Did you use Hertz or Avis? Answer the question! Will you release your minivan returns?"" Are you ready for another 20 months of this? I'm not.

From across the pond: For a little British Beto-mania we have The Independent. It published a story headlined ""Beto O'Rourke: Democrat rising star to run for president against Trump in 2020 election."" Despite the upbeat note, there was a bit of English honesty: ""His candidacy also generated a torrent of media coverage."" Bloody understatement.

Racism and sexism: But not everyone was fully on board with Beto. Because he might not be liberal enough and he's both white and male! Woke CNN mentioned this fact 52 times during the first day of O'Rourke's candidacy, just in case any of the few voters watching the network were confused by his nickname.

CBS was a little less obvious. But still, Gayle King, of ""CBS This Morning"" raised the issue of Beto being a ""privileged white man."" Remember, it's not a problem to say stuff like that when liberals do it.

"Domestic blame game begins as Trump extends support to New Zealand; reaction from The Hill columnist Buck Sexton.

The horrific news of mass murders at two New Zealand mosques that took the lives of 49 people Friday brought back terrible memories of an attack at a house of worship where I have prayed - the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 Jews were shot and killed Oct. 27, 2018.

Members of the Jewish community in my hometown of Pittsburgh know how it feels to be attacked when we gather to pray, and then to see the politicization of tragedy rub salt in our wounds. We know what it means to be targeted because of our religion, just like the Muslim victims were targeted in New Zealand.

We mourn the victims of the mosque attacks - peaceful worshippers gunned down mercilessly on their holy day of prayer, just like the Jews in Pittsburgh. No one should ever have to fear that going to a religious service could end in death.

ADAM BARSOUK: PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING: I PRAYED AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE, NOW TURNED INTO A SCENE OF DEATH

At the Tree of Life on the day of the anti-Semitic attack, what started as a quiet Shabbat in my quaint neighborhood was transformed into a crime scene - and then a media circus.

The hate crime in our community produced many portraits of heroism and unity: the man who went back to save others and was killed; the four police officers who were wounded trying to end the carnage; the Jewish doctors and nurses who saved the shooter's life after he was wounded by police; and the Muslim imam who rallied behind Pittsburgh's Jewish community and offered his prayers, support and friendship.

But this somber opportunity to unite and bridge the growing divide in our nation often went squandered. In Pittsburgh, the media coverage almost immediately turned to rhetoric on immigrants and gun control, politicizing the tragedy. Already, I've seen much the same happen in New Zealand.

We mourn the victims of the mosque attacks - peaceful worshippers gunned down mercilessly on their holy day of prayer, just like the Jews in Pittsburgh. No one should ever have to fear that going to a religious service could end in death.

When President Trump came to visit Pittsburgh to offer his condolences, he was met with protests and a cold shoulder from progressives in our city and state leadership. Instead of setting aside our differences, partisan protesters and ambitious politicians used the tragedy to further their own agendas.

Jews, Muslims and other religious minorities have been the targets of hate crimes long before automatic weapons existed and the immigration debates got fiery. The persecution continues today, including for Christians in many nations where they are the minority.

Blaming guns and politicians for the actions of a hate-filled murderer in Pittsburgh didn't help the community heal. Indeed, it was in the moments where we set aside our differences - when Jews and Muslims held hands and President Trump called for unity in an address before the nation - that Pittsburgh began to feel whole again.

I witnessed media trucks and protesters roll into my quaint neighborhood, and, after a few days, I saw them all roll out - moving on to chase the next story and set fire to the next controversy. Those of us in Pittsburgh were left picking up the pieces.

The Tree of Life Synagogue remains closed and boarded up. The families of the 11 killed and seven injured remain broken. Healing takes time. And it takes the love of a community, not vitriol spewed at our expense.

But when I pass the synagogue I see new flowers placed at the memorial. Jewish, Muslim, immigrant, minority and non-minority students at my former high school are more involved than ever in holding conversations and leading initiatives to bridge their differences and dispel prejudice.

Commonsense security has been implemented at entrances to synagogues in Pittsburgh. At some, a few worshippers reportedly bring weapons with them to pray.

All this has instilled in me a new hope that our community can move forward and prevent hate in all of its forms. At my synagogue on Saturday we prayed for New Zealand's Muslim community - for those who so needlessly perished and for those left to deal with terrible loss.

But we remember what we went through. So we pray that worshipers at the two New Zealand mosques don't suffer the same exploitation by their politicians and media, eager to push partisan agendas before the bodies have even been laid to rest.

"The movie rating service doled out the harsh metric citing ""some disturbing, bloody images."" But the movie's filmmakers fear the rating is motivated by politics. ""We made a pro-life movie in a pro-choice town"" said Chuck Konzelman, who along with Cary Solomon wrote and directed Unplanned.

Solomon excoriated Hollywood's hypocrisy for the rating awarded the film. ""The standard used to rate our movie is being applied inconsistently as it relates to bloody images on-screen,"" he told Breitbart News. ""In fact, Happy Death Day 2U (a ""slasher"" film with several violent murder scenes) has far more blood and gore than our film, and it received a PG-13 rating.""

Producers of Unplanned also fear that the harsh rating will cause many Christians who eschew R-rated films to skip the movie despite that its content doesn't rate the restrictive rating.

Now, an open letter to the film industry has been penned that is signed by a number of conservative activists, but also two Oscar-winning producers. All feel that Unplanned was targeted because of its religious message and unfairly given the R rating.

The open letter insists that the movie qualifies for a less-restrictive rating and even PG-13 movies ""are too often filled with all manner of evil, from swearing to depictions of gratuitous sexual scenes, murder, you name it.""

""Is it a group of unelected parents from Beverly Hills who meet together, watch a film and vote, and ultimately decide for you what is appropriate for your family and what's not?"" the letter adds. ""Let's not project the values of the 90210 zip code upon the rest of America.""

"National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry wrote a searing attack on the ""right-left pincer"" attacking big tech for Politico. The piece fails to mention Google CEO Sundar Pichai's recent acknowledgment that the National Review Institute, of which National Review is a wholly owned subsidiary, received money from his company.

Last month, the Google CEO confirmed that his company donated money to the National Review Institute, the nonprofit behind National Review (although he offered a confused explanation as to why Google's transparency report failed to mention the donation, which took place in 2017, until recently).

Yet the National Review's editor fails to mention the donation is his piece for Politico, bluntly titled ""Don't Break up Big Tech.""

In the piece, Lowry complains that Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren's recent proposal to break up and regulate big tech did not receive the usual ""knee-jerk Republican opposition."" Instead, writes Lowry, Warren attracted support from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), usually diametrically opposed to arch-progressive Warren, after Facebook took down ads in favor of her tech regulation proposals.

""First time I've ever retweeted [Elizabeth Warren]"" said Cruz. ""But she's right -- Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech. They shouldn't be censoring Warren, or anybody else. A serious threat to our democracy.""

To the editor-in-chief of the Google-funded National Review, this bipartisan consensus about the unaccountable power of big tech is a major problem.

""Tech is caught in a right-left pincer, made all the more powerful by the populist spirit afoot in both parties,"" complained Lowry.

""Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.""

Praising Silicon Valley behemoths as among ""the most successful and iconic American companies"" (the same might have once been said about Standard Oil), Lowry argues that Warren's proposals for regulating big tech are ""unworkable,"" and even says that the 1990s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft didn't help its competitors in search and web browsing. The thought that Microsoft, absent antitrust action, might have forced its desktop and laptop users to use Internet Explorer and Bing does not seem to have occurred to Lowry.

The editor of the Google-funded National Review also reduces conservative concerns about big tech to the fact that they're ""operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals."" No mention is given to the real examples of tech giants deliberately warping their products and abusing their power to influence American and global politics. These include, in no particular order:

Lowry goes on to specifically defends the company that donated to his publication's institute, without disclosing the donation to readers:

[Warren] calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to make Google's searches better, or is qualified to even try.

""No government regulator is going to make Google's searches better"" is a bold claim, considering that Google regularly intervenes in its own search results to boost establishment media at the expense of user-generated content, often following complaints from left-wing and establishment journalists. Then again, as Lowry is establishment media himself, perhaps that doesn't concern him very much.

A simple rule that stops search engines from manipulating results or developing special algorithms for politically charged search results would prevent Google from manually intervening to boost pro-abortion content on YouTube, but the editor of Google-funded National Review says it won't work, so I guess that settles it.

"Former gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum, left, and Stacey Abrams, right. (AP)

Former Democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum this week questioned the outcomes of their 2018 gubernatorial races -- suggesting that they, rather than their Republican opponents, should be in the governor seats.

Gillum, the former mayor of Tallahassee who lost to now-Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the state's gubernatorial race in November, hinted on HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" that both he and Abrams got enough votes to win their races, and that Abrams' may have been influenced by her opponent already being in office.

STACEY ABRAMS SAYS 2020 WHITE HOUSE BID 'DEFINITELY ON THE TABLE'

""Stacey juiced as many Dems as she could out of the state of Georgia and you also had the guy who was the referee also being the player on the field, right?"" he said, in reference to that fact that now-Gov. Brian Kemp was the state's secretary of state when he ran for office.

""Guess what, had we been able to legally count every one of those votes not just in Florida but also in Georgia, I wonder what the outcome may be,"" Gillum later said to applause. His comments were first picked up by the Florida Politics blog.

Gillum also agreed with Maher that an amendment to allow ex-felons to vote would make Florida ""a different ball game"" for Democrats next time: ""That's right,"" Gillum said.

Meanwhile Abrams, who has never conceded the Georgia governor race, reportedly said on Thursday that she won her election and didn't plan on conceding.

""I did win my election,"" she said, according to ABC News reporter Adam Kelsey. ""I just didn't get to have the job.""

Asked if she planned to formally concede to Kemp, she said: ""No.""

Abrams has repeatedly blamed voter fraud for her defeat, but she was given the role of delivering a formal State of the Union response earlier this year.

She has also pushed a possible 2020 bid. Abrams said recently that a potential 2020 presidential run is ""definitely on the table,"" which would make her the second candidate to have lost a 2018 race only to go on and declare a candidacy. Beto O'Rourke, who lost his Texas Senate bid in November, declared his candidacy this week.

The open approach toward challenging or calling into question the results of an election are in stark contrast to Democrats' stance in 2016, where politicians repeatedly expressed horror at then-candidate Donald Trump's statements that he may not accept the results of the presidential election.

""I will look at it at the time,"" Trump said when asked in a presidential debate if he would accept the result of the election.

"MIAMI -- Neil Volz was a man who had it all; Desmond Meade was a man who never had much of anything. Both of them were convicted of felonies and hit the depths of despair before realizing they could help others like them.

When the two met in 2015, it was a natural fit.

""Us meeting I don't think was no coincidence,"" Meade said. ""When you put out your vibes into the universe, it tends to come back to you, you know?""

Now, thanks to their efforts, a newly passed referendum means 1.5 million convicted felons will be able to take part in Florida's elections come November.

Five years ago, Meade founded the Floridians for a Fair Democracy to help felons like himself regain the right to vote. Volz joined the crusade one year later.

But the stories of how they got here couldn't be more different.

Volz was in his second year at Ohio State 25 years ago when he started volunteering for his state senator, Bob Ney. When Ney won a seat in Congress during the big wave year for Republicans in 1994, Volz followed him to DC ""for what I thought was my dream job.""

He quickly ascended in DC, eventually becoming Ney's chief of staff and a successful lobbyist. But, in his work for the notorious lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Volz found himself immersed in a shocking corruption scandal, cooperating with the FBI and pleading guilty to a felony count of conspiracy.

""I lost my high-paying job, my marriage, my lifestyle and any chance of a career in politics. I was a broke man,"" he said.

Meade, meanwhile, never had much to lose -- a misspent youth that became a misspent time in the Army, which threw him out on a larceny charge. By then he was addicted to cocaine and trouble.

After the loss of his mother, Meade says he was a man without a home and a moral center. ""In 2001, I was sentenced to 15 years for possession of a firearm. I only did three of those years. But when I got out, I still had the drug problem. Eventually, it led me to standing in front of railroad tracks, waiting on the train to come so I could jump in front of it in August of 2005.""

For whatever reason, the train never showed up that day. Instead, Meade walked to a rehab center two blocks away, got clean, went back to school, got two degrees and then enrolled in law school.

In 2015, both men found each other at a Florida Gulf Coast University event on felony voting rights where Meade was speaking.

""I walked in, and my instincts were that it was kind of progressive, right?"" Volz said. ""I'm a 20-plus year conservative, but I sat down and within 30 seconds, I felt like I belonged there.""

Volz joined Meade, and both lobbied to get the referendum on the ballot, restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences with just two exceptions: ""There are no voting rights for people who have been convicted of murder or any sex offenses,"" Volz said.

'They probably have to work harder for our vote than anybody else's because we've known what it's like to not have it.'

Known as Amendment 4, the referendum required at least 60 percent voter support -- and got 65 percent, more than any statewide candidate earned in Florida's November elections. That's a lot in a state where every vote has counted since the 2000 presidential election when George W. Bush was handed the presidency over Al Gore.

Over 6 million people in the US with criminal records have lost their right to vote, according to data compiled by The Sentencing Project, a Washington-based advocacy group. More than 1.5 million of them live in Florida, more than any other state in the country.

It's hard to predict which political party will most benefit from the referendum, both men said.

Meade, who is African-American, says the people who assume the amendment will benefit Democrats -- because blacks are predominantly incarcerated and more likely to vote blue -- have it all wrong.

""We know that African-Americans only accounted for like a third of the [newly] eligible voters,"" he said. The ""overall majority of folks who were impacted by this are white.""

And neither party should make assumptions about how newly enfranchised felons will vote, no matter their background.

""These political parties do have to earn our vote,"" Meade said. In fact, ""they probably have to work harder for our vote than anybody else's because we've known what it's like to not have it.""",280,New York Post,1.5 million felons can now vote in Florida because of these men

2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke was forced Friday to offer two apologies, one for a campaign joke about how he and his wife raise their children and another about an edgy short story about running over kids that he wrote when he was 15.

In a taping of the ""Political Party Live"" podcast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he apologized for a campaign joke he made on a number of occasions -- in which he quipped that his wife, Amy, raised their children ""sometimes with my help.""

While the jest picked up chuckles on the campaign trail, he apparently ruffled some feathers, with The New York Times reporting that his comments ""elicited both laughter and derision"" and cited tweets that criticized him for unwittingly exposing the double standard between male and female candidates.

""This is not the first time Mr. O'Rourke has been accused of appearing to revel in his advantages as a white male in an increasingly diverse Democratic Party,"" the Gray Lady declared.

That criticism was quickly acknowledged by Beto.

""Not only will I not say that again, but I'll be more thoughtful going forward in the way that I talk about our marriage, and also the way in which I acknowledge the truth of the criticism that I have enjoyed white privilege,"" he said on the podcast.

""So yes, I think the criticism is right on. My ham-handed attempt to try to highlight the fact that Amy has the lion's share of the burden in our family -- that she actually works but is the primary parent in our family, especially when I served in Congress, especially when I was on the campaign trail -- should have also been a moment for me to acknowledge that that is far too often the case, not just in politics, but just in life in general.

He also addressed a Reuters report that, as a 15-year-old, he wrote stories under the name ""Psychedelic Warlord"" -- including one the narrator's murder spree as part of his goal seeking ""the termination of everything that was free and loving."" The piece described the first kill as the murder of two children crossing the street.

It reads: ""Then one day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles. I knew, however, that this happiness and sense of freedom were much too overwhelming for them.

""This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams. As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I had stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head.""

"Is political rhetoric and social media to blame for New Zealand terror attack?

President Trump condemned Friday's massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, but National Journal politics editor Josh Kraushaar suggested that the president go beyond the remarks he gave at the White House.

The shootings at two mosques left at least 49 dead and dozens more injured. At the White House, Trump called the attack ""evil,"" but said he didn't believe that white supremacy violence was on the rise, and said such acts were perpetrated by only a small group of people.

Still, many Democrats and members of the mainstream media have been linking Trump to the terrorist attack and pointing to his past rhetoric, which the critics contend was motivation for the shooting suspect, who referred to the president in his manifesto.

During Friday's ""Special Report"" All-Star panel, Kraushaar -- along with Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen and the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway -- weighed in on the fallout of the New Zealand attack and the president's response.

Thiessen began by knocking the left's ""reflex"" action of blaming Trump and guns after every mass shooting. He noted the hypocrisy of the left, which refused to connect Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to the Alexandria, Va., shooting of U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., at the hands of a former Sanders campaign worker.

""If you want to find someone to blame,"" Thiessen said, ""social media is a good place to start. Social media is the accelerant that allows these things to happen.""

He then recounted how the New Zealand suspect allegedly live-streamed the attack on Facebook, shared it on YouTube, and engaged with other white nationalists on platforms like Reddit and Twitter.

Kraushaar agreed with Thiessen on the significance of social media in such attacks, but insisted that President Trump could have more forcefully denounced such violence.

""It would be a welcome gesture for President Trump not just to respond in the Oval Office but to give a speech condemning anti-Muslim bigotry and really giving a message from the White House to the rest of the world that this type of rhetoric that inspired this white supremacist killer is absolutely unacceptable,"" Kraushaar said.

Meanwhile, Hemingway urged everyone in the media not to ""highlight"" the killers of these attacks but to focus on the victims instead. She also cautioned against spreading news about the manifesto, saying it could potentially sow divisions among Americans.

""Responsible media outlets should make sure that they're careful about how they talk about it so that these acts of hatred don't further spread,"" Hemingway said. ""Sometimes downplaying the significance of what the hater believed can be helpful and just focusing people on loving one another and not letting these acts of evil overcome.""",282,Fox News,A Trump speech condemning anti-Muslim bigotry would be 'welcome gesture': Josh Kraushaar
"These people aren't interested in the common good. They are interested in themselves.

Every element of the college admissions scandal, a.k.a ""Operation Varsity Blues,"" is fascinating.

There are the players: the Yale dad who, implicated in a securities-fraud case, tipped the feds off to the caper; a shady high-school counselor turned admissions consultant; the 36-year-old Harvard grad who sold his talents for standardized testing to the highest bidder; the comely actresses from Full House and Desperate Housewives; the fashion designer; the casino magnate. Who would have thought that one of the major headlines of 2019 would be ""Lori Loughlin released on bond""?

There are the children: the social media influencer (yes this is a thing) who was told of her parents' arrest while vacationing on the yacht of a USC trustee; the mom who submitted doctored photographs to USC to portray her son as a championship pole-vaulter; the place kicker for a high school with no football team; and the rap artist from the Upper East Side who defended his mom and dad to the press while smoking a blunt.

There are the means: paying tens of thousands of dollars to Rick Singer, Trinity '86, who bribed athletic directors and coaches, doctored student r√©sum√©s, and arranged for clients to take college-admittance exams alongside a ""proctor"" who answered the questions for them. The icing on the cake: Some payments were made to a charitable foundation so the parents could get the tax write-off. What a country.

There is the objective: placement at a high-profile school. Why? Social signaling, status games, but also because the wage premium for a college degree has become so large that parents are apparently willing to break federal law to earn it. Not for what the students learn at college -- they hardly learn anything. Loughlin's daughter, the influencer, spoke for most undergraduates when she said, ""I do want the experience of game days, partying -- I don't really care about school, as you guys all know."" Oh, we know. Otherwise your mom wouldn't be looking for a defense attorney.

It's not what happens in class that matters. The university has long been corrupted by athletics, politicization of the curriculum, identity politics, grade inflation, affirmative action, the death of the humanities, and ideological bias among faculty. What matters is the chit you receive at graduation.

Finally, there are the lessons to be drawn from this story. It's the media's vocation, drawing lessons. I've heard it said that the parents ought to have been concerned about the lesson they were teaching their children -- though right now I'd wager they are more concerned with avoiding jail time. Others say this is the latest example of the falsity of meritocracy. For progressives, the affair reveals the classism and racism of our society, its rampant white privilege.

Which is a funny thing to say about the academic world. Colleges exert tremendous energy to be as diverse and inclusive and woke as possible, to the point where Asian-American students are discriminated against lest they ruin the schemes of college-admissions officers. A scandal over which the media seems far less upset.

Lessons? Here are two. First the good news: We are shocked by the actions of these parents precisely because there is so little corruption in America. If the problems were as systemic as some on the Internet believe, they would hardly raise such an outcry. Denizens of countries where bribery is a way of life look at us and say, ""Amateurs.""

The second lesson is not as comforting. Operation Varsity Blues is further evidence of the bankruptcy of American elites. For over a decade now, the legitimacy of elites in politics, foreign policy, central banking, journalism, religion, and economics has crumbled as reality failed to match their rhetoric. Education is the latest sphere where elites have betrayed our country's institutions and our country's people by using wealth and connections to rig the rules of the game.

The scandal also points to the flagrant hypocrisy of Hollywood liberalism. No class is more moralistic, more hectoring, more obnoxiously activist than the Hollywood Left. They barrage Americans with displays of their virtue, their calls to humanitarianism, their paeans to multiculturalism and feminism, their slanders of President Trump, Vice President Pence, Republicans in general, and conservatives in particular. And they have great sway in national politics. A Democrat's future depends on the beneficence of Hollywood donors -- donors who were well represented among the individuals charged in Operation Varsity Blues.

The entertainment-industry liberals talk a good game. But look at their actions. Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey are synonymous with predation. Jussie Smollett was a B-list celebrity until he faked a hate crime against himself and blamed it on supporters of Trump. Now we have actors breaking the law so their kids can go to USC.

Why on earth should we take political cues from these people? By what right do they portray themselves as enlightened, as advanced, as more sophisticated than half the country, even while they lie, cheat, steal, and assault? Plenty of baddies doing nasty things understand that donations to the Democratic party and its interest groups insulate them from scrutiny and criticism -- right until the moment they go to jail. These people aren't interested in the common good. They are interested in themselves.

"He embraced individuality at a time when the very concept was new.

Last week, I wrote about the Berthe Morisot retrospective in Dallas. It's a very good show presenting the work of a fine artist. Its sound scholarly and aesthetic points were nearly smothered by incessant assertions that Morisot, after all ""a woman impressionist,"" was thwarted and minimized during her lifetime and in the many years since, by misogynist critics, scholars, and the marketplace.

Neither is true. Morisot's work was in all but one of the impressionist rebel salons. She was favorably reviewed and got some digs. Her subject matter is limited, though, and that has affected her critical reception. She painted women and babies mostly, but that was her choice. She wasn't locked in a harem. She could have painted any subject she wanted, possibly with the exception of a brothel.

When I was a student, Morisot got as much attention in impressionist scholarship and classes as, say, Sisley, the purest of impressionists. Boudin, Caillebotte, and Bazille were in the big impressionist shows in the 1870s, Bazille after his early death, but each of these great painters figures far less in the established storyline of avant-garde art than Morisot or Mary Cassatt. Was Morisot unfairly advantaged because she was rich, or because she was married to Manet's brother? Who knows, and who cares. It's always best to let the work do most of the talking. Why make her gender so big a part of her story?

Having taken a dose of castor oil that's identity politics today, I was happy to see a show of the work of he who cleanses all palettes: Rembrandt. All the Rembrandts is the new show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam commemorating the 350th anniversary of his death in 1669. Here, Amsterdam's national museum displays all its work by Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606-1669): 300 prints, drawings, and paintings. And the message we get is as bracing, and disarming, a blast of air as any social-justice warrior could get. Rembrandt was unique.

By this I mean everyone is unique, but that very conception in Rembrandt's time was new and undeveloped. Rembrandt embraced individuality at a point when concepts such as autonomy, agency, idiosyncrasy, and personal thought, possessed by all of humankind, were either newly recognized or revitalized by opportunity and an egalitarian spirit. Amsterdam in his day was basically a new city with a new economy, a high-spirited, inventive, and entrepreneurial economy we call capitalist. The social order was bourgeois, with more people than ever able to crawl from squalor and make their own fortunes.

The show begins with a selection of about 20 of Rembrandt's small, etched self-portraits from the late 1620s to around 1630. As far as we know, an artist's study of himself of this depth and complexity was unprecedented. Rembrandt was a pronounced narcissist, to be sure. He adored himself. He was also his own model, and a cost-free one. These are tiny, three inches square, but here he is, with a baby face, wild curls, and a nose that looks like a tulip bulb. They're like photo-booth snapshots: minimalist busts, no backgrounds, and informal. He's wearing work clothes. He scowls. He pouts. He laughs. He's open-mouthed. He's wide-eyed.

In the magical 1628 painted self-portrait, a heavy shadow covers his eyes and forehead. We see enough of the rest of his face, and that mop of red hair -- we know it's Rembrandt. In Rembrandt's time, that shadow signaled that the subject was melancholic. Melancholy was not just being down-in-the-dumps. It was a condition that affected the immensely creative and intelligent with, as a leading French doctor of the day wrote, ""a kindle of divine ravishment, commonly called Enthusiasma."" Rembrandt was a fanatically fast and focused artist. What he offered to his patrons was not surface sparkle or the hallmarks of status but a peak into minds, showing a complex and unique machine of thought that each individual possessed.

Last year, I wrote about a Rembrandt show in Edinburgh focusing on how British artists and collectors saw Rembrandt. I called it a selective retrospective, covering his career with great and small things, filtered by English taste. This is a retrospective, too, but with another twist. The Rijksmuseum had only two paintings by Rembrandt until a craze for his work started to empty the Netherlands of its Rembrandts in the 1880s. Rembrandt was, in the 1630s and early 1640s, the hippest artist in Amsterdam, then on the bleeding edge of modern cities. By the 1650s, he was yesterday's man, painting in a dark, moody style when rich people wanted dash and sparkle.

Of the 22 paintings in All the Rembrandts, most came to the museum after 1960. It's an offbeat selection, but what a selection. The newest additions arrived in 2015. They're the two spectacular full-length portraits of Marten Soolmans and his wife, Oopjen, from 1634. They're his only full-length double portraits. These grand wedding portraits depicted a young, ostentatious, rich couple in a format reserved in the past for aristocrats, though these two came from new money. They wore all the best and newest fashion accessories, down to the giant rosettes on Marten's high-heeled shoes. These two were the Jared and Ivanka of their time, before the White House gig. Amsterdam in the 1630s was our Manhattan, big, new, bustling, bursting, proud, and rich. By the mid 1630s, Rembrandt was part of this new monied class. Though described by many of his biographers as ""a miller's son,"" Rembrandt's parents were well-off. He married a woman from a prosperous family and was himself a yuppie, though an intense and hard-working one. The Jewish Bride, one of his last paintings, is there, as is the 1628 Self-Portrait and, a gripping contrast, the 1661 Self-Portrait, showing Rembrandt as an old man.

Of course, The Night Watch is there. Done in 1642, it's the group portrait of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq and 17 other civic guardsmen of the local Amsterdam version of our National Guard. It was Amsterdam's largest painting, commissioned for the civic guard's banquet hall. It's worth a trip to Amsterdam on its own. First, it broke the convention of group portraiture as a boring line of heads, poses stiff, figures looking like stuffed antelopes. Second, while Rembrandt was already Amsterdam's best-known artist, this picture cemented his fame in the 19th century, by which time it was one of the world's best-known paintings.

Rembrandt conceived the scene not as static but as dynamic, or, better put, ignited. He set them in motion, a scramble of gestures, glances, sashes swinging and muskets glinting. Light and shadow appear in irregular, unexpected spots. Guns are cocked and dogs bark. It's part play-acting and part opera. Costumes and armor span a century of style. Young men, young women, old people, children, and assorted animals create not a melee but a call to action. Rembrandt turns these weekend warriors into heroes. They're volunteers, almost all were local burghers, and Amsterdam hadn't been attacked in anyone's lifetime. He made the mundane majestic.

For me, the glory of the show isn't in the paintings. Mostly, it's a print show. The paintings are part of the story, but they're additive and not overwhelming, and they certainly don't control the storyline. The Night Watch is in a separate part of the museum. The Rijksmuseum always had a superb collection of Rembrandt etchings, and to me he's as much a revered, transformative printmaker as a painter. In his case, the two media are complementary.

Prints are personal. They're small things meant to be held and scrutinized. It's an egalitarian medium. A print is a mechanical reproduction and can be distributed. It promotes direct storytelling since it's black and white and linear, though these properties invite endless and rich manipulations. Etching is the freest of media. The artist is sketching a design with a needle onto a waxed piece of copper. A confident, nimble artist can make a statement that looks fresh and spontaneous.

There are lots of prints in the show, which means close looking is essential. I'm drawn to the simple heads of bearded old men, some turbaned and some with heavy cloaks. These are the most minimalist things, but with a few lines Rembrandt presents figures of majesty and gravity, sculptural forms, and faces with the look of experience. In Rembrandt's lifetime, though, his bigger religious narrative prints were highly prized as portable devotional pieces. Christ Preaching from 1648 became known as The Hundred Guilder Print because it was pricey, but it covers the entire 19th chapter of the Book of Matthew. It's an altarpiece you can hold in your hands.

Here, Jesus, the ""Light of the World,"" stands as both a beacon and a hub for a disparate crowd. Rembrandt assembled and organized multiple figures to conflate separate stories and lessons into one image. Christ instructs the Apostle Peter to ""suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come to me,"" tells a crowd ""it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to get into heaven,"" and advises a prosperous-looking young man to ""go and sell what thou hast, and give to the poor"" if he really wants to achieve perfection. Rich, poor, the sick, and disputing Pharisees ebb and flow in pools of dark and light to create a small but authoritative universe.

When he was making prints, Rembrandt was like a novelist, always thinking about what stories would sell. In prints, where he made a lot of money, he wasn't working on a commission for a portrait or an altarpiece where he knew what the buyers wanted beforehand. He had to intuit the marketplace for ideas. Many of his religious prints, such as King David Praying, from 1652, simply put people in a pious frame of mind. It's a sumptuous, elegant image. Since David had so much for which to seek God's forgiveness, it's infinitely suggestive.

Rembrandt's personal life was like a soap opera, with multiple women, sudden deaths, endless money problems, and bad decision making on his part owing to pride, hubris, and fits of pique. He did no self-portraits in the 1640s, presenting himself at his most dapper Self-Portrait Leaning on a Stone Sill in 1639 but in 1648, after a long lapse, as a flattened-out, tired middle-aged man in Self-Portrait Etching at a Window. His woes in the interim were considerable. All of this is less visible in the show than in the unusually good biographical catalogue. It's paperback, printed on paper I'd call economical rather than cheap, written in a direct, conversational style, and filled with good material. It's nicely but not lavishly illustrated. It's one curator's point of view, but it's a lifetime's worth of experience looking at these objects, so it's opinionated and certainly not ponderous.

The Syndics from 1662 distills Rembrandt's portrait style and his age. It's direct and observational. These men, the sampling committee upholding the quality of draper's guild goods, are on a mission. They're the quality-control guys. They're standard keepers and have to look intimidating. They are always on the move, don't waste time, and we might be interrupting them. It's a snapshot of a moment in a city that never sleeps. Rembrandt captures the moment, with its nuances and textures. He's not about to miss a beat, either.

It's a great show. Rembrandt is an artist for any age where individuals are allowed freedom to think and act. The Van Gogh Museum, next store to the Rijkmuseum, offers a show on David Hockney's recent landscapes. Rembrandt offers us meat and potatoes; Hockney, cotton candy, all very pretty, airy, and leaving the soul unnourished.",284,nationalreview.com,"The Free-Thinking, Soul-Nourishing Rembrandt | National Review"
"State Rep. Lawrence Lockman, co-founder and president of the conservative Maine First Project, introduced a bill that directed the state board of education to draft a Code of Ethics for K-12 teachers, based on model legislation from the David Horowitz Freedom Center.

Though the bill ultimately died, Lockman said the debate it stirred helped him call out not only the actual left-wing indoctrination occurring in classrooms, but also the willingness of establishment Republicans to go along with it for political purposes.

""Many of the complaints I've heard from parents here in Maine were prompted by the so-called 'student walkout' last year after the shootings in Parkland, Florida,"" Lockman told Breitbart News. ""Those demonstrations were overtly partisan and political, urging passage of more restrictive firearms legislation, and targeting any legislator endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Many teachers in Maine took an active role in promoting student participation in the protests.""

At Cape Elizabeth High School, Lockman noted that both teachers and school administrators helped organize the gun-control rally - even to the extent of changing the school schedule to accommodate the gun-control advocate who was the keynote speaker at the event.

""Testimony submitted to the Education Committee established that students across the state were used as pawns,"" Lockman said, citing one person's testimony: ""Most didn't know why they were walking out or that they were part of the Woman's March agenda.""

The lawmaker said one parent testified, ""This was a taxpayer-funded protest rally, pure and simple.""

Lockman said the Education Committee also heard from a parent concerned about his seventh grader's social studies homework.

""The assignment was to research the website We the Future, which describes only leftist causes including Black Lives Matter, gun control, open borders, the Women's March,"" the parent said. ""Each student was to pick a cause and answer, 'How can you get involved?' I was shocked to see the teacher attempt to openly recruit students to support these causes.""

Lockman explained the leftist indoctrination has been getting a ""green light"" from Republican lawmakers in Maine as well.

In a column at the Freedom Center's website, the state representative explained:

There's abundant evidence that students in Maine's K-12 government schools are being subjected to Leftist indoctrination in the classroom. ""Progressive"" teachers, administrators, and textbook publishers have been working overtime to ensure that students practice ""correct thinking"" on subjects such as racial guilt, gender identity, illegal immigration, and other controversial issues.

As soon as the Code of Ethics bill was referred to the Education committee for a public hearing in late February, all the usual suspects announced their opposition. The head of the statewide teachers' union insisted that teachers never engage in political advocacy in the classroom, while the far-Left ACLU defended the right of teachers to do exactly that.

In his column, Lockman discussed that Mallory Haar, a teacher at Casco Bay High School in Portland, took to Twitter to condemn his legislation, claiming it would bar teachers from ""singling out one racial group of students as responsible for the suffering or inequities faced by another racial group of students.""

""Haar claims this proposed rule would institutionalize 'white fragility,' the most recent addition to the Leftist lexicon of identity politics, and a close relative of 'white privilege,'"" he wrote. ""One can only imagine the level of racial scapegoating and educational malpractice that goes on in Haar's classroom.""

""I struck a raw nerve in calling out the education establishment for pushing Leftist politics and ideology in the classroom,"" Lockman told Breitbart News. ""We had plenty of statewide TV, radio, and newspaper coverage, in addition to lots of traction on social media, and it was overwhelmingly in support of adopting a Code of Ethics for teachers.""

Lockman said he attributes the heightened public interest to the fact that most people either have children or grandchildren in the public schools.

""Many of these kids have been subjected to political indoctrination at school, and their parents and grandparents are fed up and frustrated,"" he explained. ""They saw that finally someone in the legislative branch of government was taking notice of the situation.""

Lockman said he has harnessed the energy created by the debate on his bill.

""My conservative nonprofit Maine First Project has launched the Forgotten Parents Initiative,"" he said. ""We aim to inform and mobilize parents at the local level, to help them push back against Leftist indoctrination in the classroom.""

""And we'll be back with similar legislation at the earliest opportunity,"" Lockman assured.",285,Breitbart,Lawmaker Calls for Ban on Partisan Ideology in Classrooms | Breitbart
"Trump issues first veto of his presidency over border security; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'

President Trump was right Friday to veto an attempt by Senate and House Democrats to prevent him from using his national emergency powers at the border.

Twelve Senate Republicans - claiming Trump overreached his constitutional authority - joined the Democrats to pass a resolution overturning Trump's authority. They're wrong.

Consider that from Jan. 20, 2009 until Jan. 5, 2011 the Democrats controlled the White House, the Senate and the House with nearly a supermajority, including two independents who caucused with the Democrats.

TRUMP WIELDS FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VETO TO NIX BORDER EMERGENCY REBUFF

But despite this power, President Obama and the Democrats refused to tackle immigration reform - an issue they claimed to care deeply about. In fact, the only major piece of controversial legislation they tackled during this time was health care reform - the hallmark of President Obama's first campaign.

Why? Because of politics.

President Obama and the Democrats were too worried about re-election. They knew a majority of Americans were against immigration reform without securing the border first, so they punted.

To deny there is no current crisis on the southwest border is like denying water is wet. The number of illegal border crossers, the amount of drugs and the number of deaths in the United States from those drugs are all a testament to our current crisis.

Instead of doing what they claimed to be right, they did what they thought was politically expedient.

Case in point: Although Obama and the Democrats ducked immigration reform in his first term, Obama lost all inhibitions in his second term when he was a lame duck president with nothing to lose.

President Obama signed two well-known executive orders: the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).

Both executive orders granted amnesty for violators of U.S. immigration law. DAPA was later ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and the vast majority of the DACA provisions were also ruled unconstitutional.

Not only did President Obama - out of fear - fail to do what he thought was right regarding immigration in his first term. While a lame duck and with nothing to lose, he signed unconstitutional executive orders.

President Trump is different. He's proven that the specter of a re-election fight isn't enough to stop him from doing what he believes is right.

Unlike Obama, Trump has shown an absolute willingness to tackle controversial issues in his first term. But President Trump does it within the confines of the law, as the Supreme Court's ruling on his travel ban showed.

More recently, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act - which provides him the power to take action when he feels the nation is threatened by a crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstance -Trump has elected to act in his first term. He declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico.

The National Emergencies Act gives Congress the authority to pass a resolution striking down an emergency declaration with a majority vote. But that action is supposed to be based on whether lawmakers feel an emergency or crisis exists - not on the perceived constitutionality of the declaration.

Only the Supreme Court can determine if the declaration is constitutional.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said it best. ""Today the National Securities Act required the Senate to answer one question,"" he said. ""Whether there is an ongoing emergency at our southern border.""

And this is where all the Democrats and a dozen Republicans in the Senate are wrong.

To deny there is no current crisis on the southwest border is like denying water is wet. The number of illegal border crossers, the amount of drugs and the number of deaths in the United States from those drugs are all a testament to our current crisis.

Congressional opposition from the Democrats was expected. We live in a political world and they played politics.

But the 12 Republican senators who voted with the Democrats to strike down the declaration of a national emergency took it upon themselves to do the Supreme Court's job. They claimed they were guarding against presidential overreach while exercising congressional overreach themselves.

Instead of taking it upon themselves to decide constitutionality, the 12 Republicans should have remained within the law and answered the one important question of whether an emergency at the border exists.

"Theresa May's crushing defeat in the House of Commons this week over her plan for Britain to leave the European Union was actually a great victory for her, provided that you make a simple assumption: that she and her colleagues never wanted Britain to leave the EU in the first place.

Her appearance of negotiating with the EU was merely elaborate shadow-play. She never intended to produce the complete break that just over half the electorate -- but not the political class -- wanted.

The present impasse will probably lead to Britain never leaving the union. Except for a hard core of about a fifth of Parliament, all the other legislators are adamantly opposed to Britain leaving the EU without a deal; and the Union, knowing this, has no reason to negotiate further.

But the legislators will not agree to the deal as negotiated, as they have now demonstrated. They want a second referendum, in the hope that the result of the first will be reversed. (And if it is, there will never be a third.)

An extension to Britain's departure will be granted only if Britain has a concrete proposal to offer -- and the only such offer it can make is to hold the second referendum.

This is, in essence, the European approach to democracy: If the voters get the answer wrong, either ignore the verdict or make them vote again until they get the answer right.

Whether the population will take it lying down remains to be seen, but after three years of deliberately created political chaos, it is likely that Britons will simply shrug and get on with their lives.

It should have been obvious from the first that the EU would never want an agreement that was anything other than disadvantageous to Britain -- for if Britain did not suffer markedly by departure, it would be a disaster for the Union, already not exactly at the height of its own popularity.

If nothing else, the Union has successfully united the vested interests of the European political class.

Nigel Lawson, long-time No. 2 to Margaret Thatcher, wrote a short but pointed letter to The Spectator last week. He said that Lord Kerr, the British diplomat who drafted Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty that Britain invoked to leave the Union, told him that he had drafted it specifically so that it would be very difficult for any country to leave.

He was certainly successful in this aim: for the philosopher-kings of the EU do not want any damned-fool population getting in the way of the implementation of their wisdom.

This view accords perfectly with the founders of the ""European project"" over 60 years ago; they wanted to eliminate messy politics through neat, clean administration.

Britain has been thoroughly humiliated by the whole episode, but history has no end, and Yugoslavian-style wars of secession may yet, in the distant future, occur.",288,New York Post,Brexit's in trouble because Britain's political class never wanted
"Democrats, now in full control of state government, revealed their top priority this week: rank politics -- consequences be damned.

That's clear from two proposals in the Legislature's one-house budget bills: one to extend ""prevailing wage"" laws to private construction projects that get public incentives; the other to create a ""pied-√†-terre"" tax in the city. Both spell trouble.

Prevailing-wage laws (which force builders to pay union rates on public projects) fuel building costs -- by as much as 23 percent in the city, the Independent Budget Office found. Applying the laws to private construction in Mayor de Blasio's affordable-housing plan, the IBO notes, would add $4.2 billion to its price tag.

Imposing higher costs also defeats the purpose of incentives and thwarts development. When city pols demanded Related Cos. pay a ""living wage"" at a Bronx mall planned for the Kingsbridge Armory, the firm walked. A decade later, the building is still vacant.

Such results are fine with the unions that are the driving force behind these laws; blocking non-union jobs is the whole point.

And Democrats in the Legislature plainly see pleasing unions as Job No. 1.

Naked politics is also behind the sudden enthusiasm for a pied-√†-terre tax. After all, it's aimed at people who don't live in the city, but only visit -- and so don't vote here. What New Yorker would object to a tax on wealthy out-of-towners?

Well, first off: Just as with the ""congestion"" tolls proposed for Manhattan, this is the state grabbing revenue that should belong to the city, like other property taxes.

The governor and state Senate would dedicate the revenue for the MTA -- but you can bet they'll count it as their contribution to the agency. (And the Assembly just wants the tax to fund its overall huge boost in statewide spending.) It also means trouble for future MTA budgets, the Empire Center's E.J. McMahon warns, since real-estate-tax revenues are highly volatile.

Plus, as McMahon also notes, the tax would drag down all luxury-unit values, meaning lower assessments and thus less tax revenue for the city. The nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission points to the same flaw, which also likely means the tax won't bring in as much as projected.

Lawmakers don't seem worried by any of this: It gives them more to spend now -- and to them, what else matters?",289,New York Post,Naked politics is driving Albany Democrats
"David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, asked staff writer Lawrence Wright to ""explain Texas."" He made this request because he was mistakenly under the impression that Wright lives in Texas, which he does not: He lives in Austin -- you can see Texas from there, but Austin isn't quite it.

Wright produced a book on the subject, and it is a mess. From my review in the Claremont Review of Books:

It is not, as it proposes to be, a meditation on the culture and politics of Texas and their influence on the wider American scene. It is an overflowing slop-bucket of ignorance, laziness, and snobbery in the shape of a book.

One of my least favorite things in this world is that aw-shucks, phony, cornpone Texan-ism adopted by so many people associated with my state. I admire George W. Bush a great deal, but I do not know where that weird accent comes from; it isn't Midland. Molly Ivins was a great offender on the ersatz Texan-ism score: She knew a lot more about yachts than she did about cotton fields, but she created a ridiculous down-home persona. (She once tried to launch a television talk show, and her set was done up like a back porch, with a swing.) Rick Perry seems to have outgrown this, blessedly: He's a cowboy the way Elizabeth Warren is an Indian. (I remain convinced that if Rick Perry had gone on the campaign trail speaking the ordinary literate English I know him to be capable of, he would be president.) Natalie Maines, as close as you will get to a champagne radical in Lubbock, has a bit of it, too.",290,nationalreview.com,Phony Texan-ism  | National Review
"Arthur Brooks asked an expert marriage counselor what emotion is correlated with divorce. It's not anger. Anger, according to Brooks, is a ""hot emotion that says 'I care.' It might not be pleasant, but it doesn't lead to divorce."" Instead of anger, eye rolling, dismissive humor, derision, and sarcasm are much better predictors of divorce. In a word, says Brooks: ""contempt.""

In his latest book, Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt, Dr. Brooks -- president of the American Enterprise Institute, and my boss -- rejects the notion that incivility and intolerance are the core problems in America today. Instead, Brooks argues that ""motive attribution asymmetry"" leads people to assume that those with whom they disagree are motivated by hate. This shuts off the possibility of negotiation and compromise, and breeds contempt, which Brooks defines as a combination of anger and disgust. Contempt, not only for the ideas held by those with whom we disagree, but also, and more significantly, for the people who hold those ideas.

From an essay Brooks wrote, adapted from the book:

Contempt makes political compromise and progress impossible. It also makes us unhappy as people. According to the American Psychological Association, the feeling of rejection, so often experienced after being treated with contempt, increases anxiety, depression and sadness. It also damages the contemptuous person by stimulating two stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. In ways both public and personal, contempt causes us deep harm.

The argument Dr. Brooks makes that resonates most strongly with me is first to reject the notion that disagreement is bad.

You might be tempted to say we need to find ways to disagree less, but that is incorrect. Disagreement is good because competition is good. Competition lies behind democracy in politics and markets in the economy, which -- bounded by the rule of law and morality -- bring about excellence. Just as in politics and economics, we need a robust ""competition of ideas"" -- a.k.a. disagreement. Disagreement helps us innovate, improve and find the truth.

Instead, according to Brooks, we need to disagree better.",291,nationalreview.com,"Love Your Enemies, But Still Disagree with Them | National Review"

On the roster: Washington goes soft - Beto O'Rourke, hipster hacker - Trump issues first veto, slaps back at Congress' rebuke - It's Mueller time (almost) - Life, liberty and the finger

WASHINGTON GOES SOFT

The Irish have a wonderful way to refer to days like this one in Washington: ""soft.""

The air is cool but not chilly and certainly a little damp. The winds are mild and when the sun breaks through from time to time it reveals a glorious brilliance and sapphire-blue skies behind.

Yes, spring is springing here in America's Mid-Atlantic and it is, as always, stirringly, heart-rendingly beautiful. Other places in America may have consistently better weather, but no place in America has a finer pageant of seasons than ours. An army of daffodils is rising up even now to protect our title.

But the effects on the population are noticeable. Children begin to slouch toward a touch of languid insolence and adults begin to stir at the thought of all the wonderful things they want to see and do in these fine days. Spring fever is here indeed.

With that in mind, perhaps we can best hold your attention with some newsy nuggets from a very unusual day and week in politics.

- How racist and sexist do Democrats believe Americans to be? Serious question. In 2008, there were plenty of Democrats who either openly or not-so-openly said that as much as they liiiiked Barack Obama that America just wasn't ""ready"" for an African-American president. A similar argument was had about the party's 2016 female nominee. There's visible discontentment within the Democratic base that three members of the 2020 top tier are white dudes: Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke and Joe Biden. Democrats have not selected a male person of pallor as their nominee for 15 years. And there's no doubt that no matter how many ""this is what a feminist looks like"" t-shirts they wear, the B brothers will come in for continued criticism of their gender and ethnicity. But also don't forget that many Democrats believe that sexism and racism were major forces against their Obama and Hillary Clinton. So if you are concerned about pervasive racism and sexism among Americans today might there be an incentive to actually pick a nominee who could avoid these issues?

- It's starting to dawn on Democrats that they picked a terrible time to give up their top-down, tightly controlled nominating process. The party has changed its nominating rules to open up the process to Sanders, who got shafted by party insiders in 2016. It will come at a considerable cost. The folks at FiveThirtyEight observe that with now more than a dozen credible contenders in the race, the chances of a contested convention are rising by the day. And if that moment - which would be the Dems' first since 1952 - should come in Milwaukee next year, the party will be badly ill-equipped to keep the peace.

- White House whisperers tell Politico that President Trump is fixating on Biden as perhaps his most dangerous general election opponent. Trump may very well be right. Biden is the best known and best liked of any Democrat running for the party's nomination. But Republicans should bear in mind that one of the other candidates might well emerge over the next 10 months as a more formidable opponent. Remember how Democrats in 2016 were gearing up the fight an establishment Republican and worked to stir up the GOP base in favor of long-shot candidates like... oh yeah, the guy who is now the sitting president of the United States.

- Jeb Bush has a lot in common with Hillary Clinton. They are both considered the less successful, more serious members of their respective political dynasties. Now we can add another one: Coming back from the political wilderness to make trouble for their political party. In an interview with David Axelrod set to air this weekend, the former Florida governor and exclamation point enthusiast called for a primary challenge to President Trump. ""I think someone should run just because Republicans ought to be given a choice,"" Bush said. ""It's hard to beat a sitting president, but to have a conversation about what it is to be a conservative, I think it's important."" Bush also had encouraging words for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is currently considering a 2020 presidential run.

- What's a 'Jexodus' anyway? The president tweeted about it this morning. And its apparently a follow up on Team Trump's efforts to use professional celebrity Kanye West to sell something called ""Blexit,"" the purported mass exit of black voters from the Democratic Party in favor of Trump's GOP. This portmanteau is Jewish + exodus = Jexodus. Coupla points here: First, the original Exodus was Jewish so isn't that kind of redundant? Second, there's no sign of such a thing. One way that Republicans often misunderstand Jewish voters is by imagining that it is their Jewishness that makes them Democratic. The major American metropolitan areas with the largest concentration of Jewish Americans - led by New York, Philadelphia and Miami by one estimate - are overwhelmingly Democratic. If you took a sampling of almost any major sect or ethnic group in those places they would also be overwhelmingly Democratic. Republicans' staunch support for Israel has no doubt won many converts, but the partisan percentages for Jewish voters remain remarkably consistent. According to one poll, 67 percent of Jews backed Democrats in 2018 compared with 20 percent for the GOP.

- Trump had to take down a different tweet today. He had blasted out his ominous-sounding claim in an interview with a nationalist web site in which he warned of coming political violence. ""I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump - I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough -- until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad."" But Trump's account took down the tweet this morning when the president wanted to broadcast his expression of sympathy for the victims of a mass murder of Muslim worshipers in New Zealand. We suppose it's good that the White House understands how such loose talk about civil strife is inappropriate. But if that's so, wouldn't that argue against ever saying such things in the first place?

- As the daffodils prepare to raise their heads to face the glorious sun, we hope that you are preparing for your own splendid weekend. See you Monday.

TIME OUT: RATH D√â ORT

History: ""Every March 17, the United States becomes an emerald country for a day. Americans wear green clothes and quaff green beer. Green milkshakes, bagels and grits appear on menus. In a leprechaun-worthy shenanigan, Chicago even dyes its river green. Revelers from coast to coast celebrate all things Irish by hoisting pints of Guinness and cheering bagpipers, step dancers and marching bands parading through city streets. These familiar annual traditions weren't imported from Ireland, however. They were made in America. In contrast to the merry-making in the United States, March 17 has been more holy day than holiday in Ireland. Since 1631, St. Patrick's Day has been a religious feast day to commemorate the anniversary of the 5th-century death of the missionary credited with spreading Christianity to Ireland. For several centuries, March 17 was a day of solemnity in Ireland with Catholics attending church in the morning and partaking of modest feasts in the afternoon.""

BETO O'ROURKE, HIPSTER HACKER

Reuters: ""While a teenager, [Beto O'Rourke] acknowledged in an exclusive interview, he belonged to the oldest group of computer hackers in U.S. history. ... An ex-hacker running for national office would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. But that was before two national elections sent people from other nontraditional backgrounds to the White House and Congress, many of them vowing to blow up the status quo. Arguably, there has been no better time to be an American politician rebelling against business as usual. Still, it's unclear whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who, as a teenager, stole long-distance phone service for his dial-up modem, wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drives over children on the street, and mused about a society without money.""

Racks up endorsements, even on Gillibrand's turf - Texas Tribune: ""Four Democratic members of Congress quickly endorsed former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke's presidential bid within hours of his official announcement Thursday. U.S. Reps. Sean Patrick Maloney and Kathleen Rice, both of New York; Stephanie Murphy of Florida; and Veronica Escobar of El Paso all announced their support for O'Rourke to be their party's nominee for president in 2020. All four are part of the younger generation of Democratic House members. All joined the chamber either with O'Rourke in 2013 or afterwards. 'I have endorsed Beto O'Rourke in every election he's run -- including this exciting run for President of the United States -- because he is an extraordinary public servant, driven by compassion and a desire to unify,' Escobar, who succeeded O'Rourke in his El Paso-based district in January, said in a post on Facebook.""

Barnstorms Iowa - Texas Tribune: ""Making his debut Thursday in Iowa, hours after announcing his presidential campaign, Beto O'Rourke all but picked up where he left off in his blockbuster U.S. Senate run last year, bringing his off-the-cuff, frenetic campaign style to the towns that outline the Mississippi River. It was a return to form for O'Rourke, who has made ample public appearances in recent weeks but few that allowed him to practice the retail-heavy politics that animated his bid against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. If the style wasn't new, the setting certainly was. 'This is my first time to ever visit Iowa,' O'Rourke declared Thursday morning inside a coffee shop in Keokuk, where he kicked off the three-day Iowa swing. ... Many of his rivals have already logged multiple trips to the state and made multiple hires, though if the reception O'Rourke got Thursday was any indication, he has not yet missed his moment.""

Bernie's campaign becomes the first in history to unionize - AP: ""Campaign workers for Bernie Sanders' 2020 Democratic campaign have unionized, becoming the first presidential campaign workers in history to do so. The United Food & Commercial Workers Local 400 confirmed Friday that Sanders' campaign workers were the first to win union representation. UFCW Local 400 President Mark P. Federici says he expects the decision will mean that Sanders' campaign workers have pay parity and transparency, as well as no gender bias and harassment. Earlier this year, Sanders apologized to female staffers on his 2016 campaign who said they experienced sexual harassment from male staffers. The New York Times reported allegations of unwanted sexual advances, as well as pay inequity. Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir says the Vermont senator is honored to be the first presidential candidate with a unionized workforce.""

Bernie's wife closes family non-profit amid ethics worries - AP: ""The Sanders Institute, a think tank founded by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' wife and son, is shutting down, at least for now, amid criticism that the nonprofit has blurred the lines between family, fundraising and campaigning. The Vermont-based institute has stopped accepting donations and plans to suspend all operations by the end of May ""so there could not even be an appearance of impropriety,"" Jane Sanders told The Associated Press. .... Jane Sanders, who also serves as a chief adviser to her husband's presidential campaign, is not compensated for her role at the institute. Her son, David Driscoll, is paid $100,000 a year as co-founder and executive director. Driscoll previously was an executive for Nike and the Vermont snowboarding firm Burton, but had no previous nonprofit experience, according to his LinkedIn profile.""

Ouch: Bernie campaigns with big bandage after bathroom mishap - Politico: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders cut his head on a glass shower door on Friday morning and received seven stitches, his campaign announced. But the 2020 candidate was given a 'clean bill of health' and will attend all of his previously scheduled campaign events over the next couple days. Arianna Jones, a Sanders spokeswoman, said 'out of precaution, he went to a walk-in clinic' to have the cut checked out.""

Harris keeps focus on South Carolina - Guardian: ""This was the third trip [Sen. Kamala Harris] has made to South Carolina since launching her campaign, making it her most visited of the first four primary states in next year's election. There is now established thought in Democratic circles that winning South Carolina, with its diverse voting constituency, provides the real gateway to the party's nomination rather than the starting states of New Hampshire and Iowa with their overwhelmingly white electorate. Senior campaign aides say Harris will give equal time to all four early states throughout the race. Recent public polls place the senator third here at 13%, behind the more familiar names of Joe Biden, who has yet to declare a bid, and Bernie Sanders, who ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016 but failed to win the state. She placed fourth in a recent poll among caucus goers in Iowa.""

Klobuchar: It takes a tough boss to deal with Putin - Mediaite: ""With presidential candidate and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) dealing with, sometimes wild, reports about mistreatment of her staff in the Senate, Klobuchar defended her management style - saying toughness is needed on the world stage. 'Your campaign was shaken up in the early days by multiple reports, negative reports about how you've treated your past at times. Your answer was, too, I can be too hard. What's too hard,' CNN's Poppy Harlow asked. '...If, you know, they felt that something was unfair or they felt bad about something, but I still think that you have to demand good product. When you are out there on the world stage and dealing with people like Vladimir Putin, yeah, you want someone who is tough,' she added. 'You want someone that demands the answers and that is going to get things done. That's what I've done my whole life.'""

Booker cops to romance with actress Rosario Dawson - Fox News: ""Presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker confirmed on Friday that he's dating actress Rosario Dawson. 'I am dating Rosario Dawson and I'm very happy about it,' the New Jersey Democrat told reporters following a campaign stop in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary along the road to the White House. 'She's a wonderful actor,' Booker highlighted. The 39-year old actress broke the news on Thursday, saying 'yes, very much so,' when asked by TMZ at Washington's Reagan-National airport if she was involved with Booker, who turns 50 next month. 'He's a wonderful human being. It's good to spend some time together when we can. Very busy.' ... If Booker wins the White House, he would become just the third bachelor in the nation's history to serve as president.""

TRUMP ISSUES FIRST VETO, SLAPS BACK AT CONGRESS' REBUKE

AP: ""President Donald Trump issued the first veto of his presidency on Friday, overruling Congress to protect his emergency declaration for border wall funding. Flanked by law enforcement officials as well as the parents of children killed by people in the country illegally, Trump maintained that he is not through fighting for his signature campaign promise, which stands largely unfulfilled 18 months before voters decide whether to grant him another term. 'Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution,' Trump said, 'and I have the duty to veto it.' A dozen defecting Republicans joined Senate Democrats in approving the joint resolution on Thursday, which capped a week of confrontation with the White House as both parties in Congress strained to exert their power in new ways. It is unlikely that Congress will have the two-thirds majority required to override Trump's veto, though House Democrats have suggested they would try nonetheless.""

The week trump lost Congress - NYT: ""Time and again ... lawmakers on Capitol Hill warned him not to push them too far. This week, in a remarkable series of bipartisan rebukes to the president, Congress pushed back. On Wednesday, with seven Republicans breaking ranks, the Senate joined the Democrat-led House in voting to end American military aid to Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen in protest over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post. On Thursday morning, the House voted unanimously on a nonbinding resolution to make public the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. And on Thursday afternoon, 12 Republican senators abandoned the president to pass legislation, already adopted by the House, that would block Mr. Trump from declaring a national emergency to build his border wall -- an act of defiance that he has vowed to overturn with the first veto of his presidency.""

Senators facing 2020 re-election stick with Trump on emergency funding - Politico: ""Two weeks ago, Sen. Thom Tillis said President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration violated the separation of powers and created a dangerous precedent, stating in an op-ed that he would vote to reverse it. On Thursday, the North Carolina Republican flipped and sided with Trump on the border vote. While a dozen Senate Republicans joined Democrats to support a resolution undoing Trump's move to fund a border wall, Tillis and all but one other Republican up for reelection in 2020 -- Sen. Susan Collins of Maine -- stuck with the president. The list includes Sen. Cory Gardner of blue-trending Colorado and Sen. Martha McSally, who was appointed this year but will face Arizona voters again in 2020 after losing a tough race in 2018. The vote underscores how little Republicans on the ballot in 2020 want to break with the president, even on an issue that divided the party and in states where Trump's approval rating is low.""

Sasse, Tillis face conservative backlash - WashEx: ""While consistent constitutional conservatives including Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul held firm, other conservatives who often warn about the erosion of checks on executive power, prominently Sens. Ted Cruz and Ben Sasse, caved. Thom Tillis, who actually wrote an op-ed outlining why he would vote against the measure, changed his mind when it came to vote. In explaining away his decision, Sasse said: ""...I think that law is overly broad and I want to fix it, but at present Nancy Pelosi doesn't, so I am therefore voting against her politically motivated resolution. As a constitutional conservative, I believe that the NEA currently on the books should be narrowed considerably."" ... He is setting up a classic false choice. Sasse has in the past lamented the tendency of people to put their preferred outcomes over respecting process and institutional checks on power, and yet here he is, embracing a move because of the policy outcome.

IT'S MUELLER TIME (ALMOST)

Fox News: ""For weeks, rumors have been swirling that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is nearing the end of his years-long Russia investigation -- and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are eager to make his final report public. The House of Representatives unanimously voted (420-0) Thursday in favor of a resolution to urge Attorney General William Barr to release Mueller's full report to Congress and the country for the sake of 'transparency.' The probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election -- and has since resulted in charges for several former Trump campaign associates, though none have directly related to collusion. Trump called the investigation 'illegal' and 'conflicted' this week, arguing Mueller should have never been appointed in the first place. ... When the investigation -- which began in May 2017 -- concludes, Mueller will release his final report to Barr, who has been overseeing the special counsel since he took office in February.""

Graham ready to deploy countermeasures - Politico: ""Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham is demanding answers from the Justice Department about former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's explosive allegation that top officials there discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office. In a letter to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, Graham said his panel intends to investigate the allegations and gave Barr a two-week deadline to turn over any documents relating to conversations between McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the 25th Amendment or about covertly recording Trump. Last month, during a media blitz to promote his new book, McCabe said that after the abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey, Rosenstein had offered to wear a wire into the White House and furthermore had brought up whether Trump could be removed from office using the 25th Amendment.""

To investigate or to legislate? - NPR: ""Nowhere else in the House of Representatives is the tension between legislation and investigation more present than on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where a bipartisan infrastructure deal could be in the making -- even as the Democrats on the committee launch a reinvigorated investigation into the D.C. Trump Hotel. 'I have to do my duty over here and get questions answered,' committee Chairman Peter DeFazio told NPR. 'But I also need to pursue vigorously working with the White House to try and move an infrastructure package. And I'm willing and able to do both, and I think that the president will understand that if he really wants to do infrastructure.' Trump famously declared at his latest State of the Union address that members of Congress could choose between working with him on passing bills or probe his business and administration -- not both.""

LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE FINGER

NPR: ""If you've ever been tempted to make a rude gesture at a police officer, you can rest assured that the Constitution protects your right to do so, a federal appeals court says. In the sequence of events described by the court, a woman in Michigan, Debra Cruise-Gulyas, was pulled over in 2017 for speeding. The officer showed leniency, writing her up for a lesser violation known as a nonmoving violation. As she drove away, apparently insufficiently appreciative of the officer's gesture, Cruise-Gulyas made a certain gesture of her own. Or as the court put it, 'she made an all-too-familiar gesture at [Officer Matthew Minard] with her hand and without four of her fingers showing.' Minard was not amused. He pulled her over again and rewrote the ticket for speeding. Cruise-Gulyas sued, arguing she had a First Amendment right to wiggle whatever finger she wanted at the police. ... The court's ruling means Cruise-Gulyas' lawsuit can proceed in a lower court.""

"Lincoln the goat, 3, was elected the official ""pet mayor"" of Fair Haven, Vermont, with 13 votes.

The Nubian goat narrowly beat out Sammie Viger, a Boston Terrier, who fell just short with 11 votes. The remainder of the 53 counted votes were spread amongst a 16-animal candidacy.

While Fair Haven does not have a human mayor, Town Manager Joe Gunter held the election to encourage children to get involved in local politics -- and raise money for a new playground in the process.

"At best they're just regurgitating the lies, fake news and junk science which have been brainwashed into their pretty little heads by their teachers.

At worst they're just being exploited as useful idiots by the hard left.

A good example of the latter was the chanting, at the London demonstration, captured on video here:

One Two Three Four, Theresa May's a fucking whore.

According to Guido, ""people who appeared to be teachers were egging on the chanting.""

This speaks volumes about the degree to which hard-left politics has been allowed to penetrate school classrooms. Extreme ignorance, too. There are many, many criticisms that could be made of Britain's worst ever Prime Minister Theresa May. But being a ""fucking whore"" is most definitely not one of them. If she were, it would at least add an element of interest to her dreary personality and apparently hinterland-free existence.

Also, why pick on Theresa May?

Again, there are many, many criticisms one could make of Theresa May's Conservative government. But being dilatory on the issue of ""climate change"" is not one of them. On the contrary, the policy of May and her government in response to the man-made global warming scare has been at least as credulous, intrusive, economically damaging, and scientifically illiterate as any left-wing administration's would have been.

These global protests, let us remind ourselves, were instigated by a 16-year old schoolgirl called Greta Thunberg, whose earnest intensity and wholesome appearance (apparently modelled on Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz) have made her something of an internet star among the left-liberal chattering classes.

Indeed, she has become such an icon of the left that she has been nominated - ludicrously - for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Thunberg's contention - and the excuse of the marchers for bunking off school - is that nothing is being done to fight climate change.

According to the #FridaysForFuture website which is promoting the strikes:

#FridaysForFuture is a movement that began in August 2018, after 15 years old Greta Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament every schoolday for three weeks, to protest against the lack of action on the climate crisis. She posted what she was doing on Instagram and Twitter and it soon went viral.

Lack of action? Really?? We'll come back to that one in a moment.

Oh, and here's another high-profile protestor - 16-year-old Isra Hirsa, daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar - interviewed in the Guardian about her motivation for leading one of the strike actions in the U.S.

""I'm hoping a lot of things. I just want that awareness and education -- I want people to understand the intense emergency of climate change, and that young people aren't really going to be backing down. And also I want folks to feel...threatened enough to take climate action.""

All this might seem perfectly admirable if these children's claims were true: that there really is such a thing as the ""climate crisis"" and that ""nothing"" is being done to avert it.

But it's simply not true, is it?

The annual cost of the global industry to 'combat climate change' has been estimated at $1.5 trillion. (That was four years ago, since when the cost has no doubt skyrocketed).

By whatever definition you care to use $1.5 trillion is not ""nothing."" In numerals it looks like this: $1,500,000,000,000. Even kids who have a problem with arithmetic - hardly surprising when their teachers are encouraging them to waste schooltime on climate marches - ought to be able to see that that is not ""nothing"" but ""an awful lot"".

Those kids are protesting on the basis of one massive lie.

But it gets worse. Not only is that $1.5 trillion - all of which comes from taxpayers - an awful lot of money. It's also an awful lot of money which is being spent to no useful purpose whatsoever.

In 2015, using the United Nations' own calculations, Bj√∏rn ""Skeptical Environmentalist"" Lomborg found that if every country in the world sticks to the ""decarbonisation"" promises it made at the Paris Climate Summit - unlikely by the way because the agreements are non-binding - then the resultant reduction, by the end of the century, in global warming may be 0.048¬∞C (0.086¬∞F).

For kids who can understand fractions - again, unlikely these days - that's less than one twentieth of one degree centigrade.

The kids' climate strike is stupid, dishonest and pointless. If only their teachers were clever enough to help them understand this.",294,Breitbart,"Delingpole: 1.5 Trillion Reasons Why the Kids' Climate Strike Is Dishonest, Stupid, Pointless"
"Friday on MSNBC's ""Live,"" Princeton professor and network contributor Eddie Glaude, Jr. commented on the mass shooting at two New Zealand mosques that left 49 dead.

Glaude said, ""I am thinking about all of Muslim parents in New Zealand who have to talk to their children. Who have to allay their fears about going to Jum'ah, Jum'ah prayers on Fridays. Who have to keep the hate from taking root in their souls as fear. Because we live in a world that's really dominated in interesting sorts of ways by a politics of hatred and fear that's exploited by people for their own political gains. What's clear to me, and we see this in the United States, is the problem is not with immigrants. The problem is not the people of color. It is not us. It has something to do with the crisis of whiteness and how it is generating unimaginable carnage.""

He added, ""What I have been trying to do is make sense of this at the existential level, at the level of what it means to have to raise one's babies where you are targeted in this way. So as we think of what's happening and we look on and examine what we are doing over here, we have to understand how hatred and fear is eroding the soul of the country and address it honestly.""",295,Breitbart,MSNBC's Glaude: 'The Crisis of Whiteness' Is Generating 'Unimaginable Carnage' | Breitbart
"Christchurch was a modern horror, and it requires a modern response.

Two days before the murder of more than 49 Muslims in two New Zealand mosques, the apparent shooter -- one of four people currently detained in connection with the attacks -- uploaded several videos to his Twitter account. He then published his manifesto on the 8chan imageboard and Twitter. During the shooting, he set up a live-stream, recording the event and broadcasting it on Facebook Live.

As the news broke, dazed, ordinary people looking for information stumbled upon and shared the Twitter account, screenshots of the manifesto, and the video before any of the platforms that hosted them could stop it, making the massacre go viral.

Christchurch was a distinctly modern horror.

And, as with anything modern, people were unsure how to react. The attack almost resembled past terrorist incidents, but parted with them in bizarre ways. Like Anders Breivik's, this shooter's manifesto was a white-supremacist clarion call -- but it doubled as a series of in-jokes meant for frequenters of the politics forums on 4chan and 8chan. Like the ISIS beheadings, the video was gruesome and sickening -- but it doubled as a hyperreal homage to first-person-shooter video games and was captioned with a Serbian-nationalist meme. Like Cesar Sayoc's, this shooter's Twitter account provided a window into the time he spent on the online right -- but rather than being compiled over several months in an organic portrait of the terrorist's habits, it was self-consciously curated in the course of a day. Even for ideologically motivated violence -- even for white-supremacist violence -- Christchurch seemed novel.

Nobody in the press wants to unwittingly further this man's goals, and everyone agrees that caution is paramount when discussing events this delicate. So what should we do? One approach is to avoid sharing any of the shooter's online output, the goal being to minimize any potential social contagion and to prevent people from stumbling upon his twisted beliefs and being radicalized. Insofar as the shooting was a performance, we want to minimize its audience; insofar as it was ""fundamentally thoughtless,"" we want to avoid attributing any unearned logic to its perpetrator.

Those guardrails are important to keep in mind. But just as it's important also to understand that the shooter was a fascist, it is, I think, equally important to understand that the shooter made certain choices in his presentation of the attack because he expected people to react to it in certain ways. The shooter says he carried out the attack for ""my people,"" because he believes that Muslim migration to European countries constitutes an ""invasion,"" one for which he wished to exact revenge. But he also included a number of ironic tropes intended to signal to his in-group and obscure what he was thinking to the out-group, only widening the cultural gulf between the two.

Luckily, these signals aren't impenetrable. Some of what the shooter wrote in his manifesto was ""sh**posting,"" low-quality online trolling designed to shock those who aren't sufficiently desensitized or in the know. The gleeful cruelty of the alt-right's sh**posting in 2016, for instance, fooled mainstream journalists who couldn't imagine people being glib about death threats or ethnostate advocacy. Their defensive and outraged reactions to something ostensibly ironic fueled the thing they were trying to stamp out. Sh**posting is ironic, vacuous. But it can also conceal something darker, as the apparent shooter's 8chan post reveals: ""Well lads, it's time to stop sh**posting and time to make a real life effort post.""

If the mindset of the effort-poster is understandable -- he's an old-fashioned fanatic, like Breivik or Theodore Kaczynski -- the mindset of the sh**poster is understandably confusing. And after this shooting, the retreat in some corners to preexisting partisan frames demonstrated that confusion. For example, the tendency to make every mass shooting, however international, a referendum on American gun-control policy is currently on display, but the shooter says explicitly that he hoped this would happen in the aftermath of his shooting because he believes a fear among white Americans that their gun rights are insecure will one day be the catalyst for a race war in the U.S.

Meanwhile, there are already calls to deplatform two people mentioned in the manifesto, Swedish YouTuber Pewdiepie and Turning Point USA communications director Candace Owens, from social media. But several astute observers have discerned the shooter's claims that Pewdiepie and Owens drove him to action to be sarcastic. Did he intend to draw extra attention to them, to convince social-media platforms to jettison them -- and to create a backlash among their fanbases? As with the gun debate, the shooter might have been trying to provoke a response that would radicalize his in-group and drive others into its arms.

How can we know when the shooter was being sincere and when he was kidding? The writer Robert Evans makes a convincing distinction:

It is possible, even likely that the author was a fan of Owens's videos: she certainly espouses anti-immigrant rhetoric. But in context seems likely that his references to Owens were calculated to spark division, and perhaps even violence, between the left and the right. At multiple points in the manifesto the author expresses the hope that his massacre will spark further attempts at gun control in the United States, which he believes will lead to gun confiscation and a civil war. He believes this civil war would be the best opportunity destroy the American ""melting pot"". This idea is repeated often enough that it seems to be something the author legitimately believes in.

Given the tone surrounding the Candace Owens passage, it seems clear that it was ""bait"", thrown out to attract attention on social media and sow further political division.

This doesn't mean the conversations about gun policy and social-media moderation should be off-limits simply because the shooter wanted to provoke them. But we should bear in mind that he did want to. Like disinformation campaigns that seek to exploit partisan divisions, the manifesto is intended to act as a wedge in our most contentious, divisive policy debates. It is simultaneously sincere and trollish in ways that appear to contradict each other but actually are mutually reinforcing.

Like others before him, the shooter wanted to commit eliminationist violence in service of a white-supremacist dream. But I'm left thinking he also wanted to deepen existing conflicts in a way that will prompt a cycle of overreach and radicalization that culminates in other people like him deciding to one day join him. We should be able to condemn the evil ideology he represents while also being careful not to accidentally become vectors of it ourselves -- whether that means uncritically sharing a manifesto, or unwittingly behaving as the shooter anticipated, or unduly attributing to it any special power, any undeserved mysteriousness.",296,nationalreview.com,A Mass Murder for the Age of Sh**posting
"View from mass murderer's body camera as he prepares to enter New Zealand mosque

One of the biggest lies we hear whenever there is a mass terror attack, such as the one against New Zealand's Muslims, is that the killing was ""senseless."" It's not without reason when ISIS does it, and it's not without reason when people like Brenton Tarrant, the alleged NZ shooter, do it. The acts are evil, but not senseless; there is a rationale for what they do. To be clear: do NOT read me as saying Tarrant's acts ""made sense"" in the general sense of the term; I'm speaking narrowly here, to mean that causation is at work. We need to know this so we can better combat things like this.

I read Tarrant's manifesto, which is easy to find online, though I'm not going to link to it here. It's a chilling document, for a couple of reasons. First, it's grounded in both paranoid, racist grievance, and legitimate, realistic concerns. Second, as with ISIS videos and propaganda, the Internet distributes this stuff worldwide; we may be certain that Tarrant's manifesto will strike many resonant chords with murder-minded fanatical racists like himself.

Though I don't want to be part of spreading the manifesto, I do want to talk about a few parts of it, including parts you may not hear about in the media reporting. It's important to talk about it. I will say here clearly that any reader who in any way attempts to justify this atrocity in New Zealand will NOT be posted. It was a despicable act, and if you pray, join me in praying for the souls of the murdered, and the families they left behind.

That said, some comments on the manifesto (you can read a general NYT report on it here). I read it in the same vein as I read the bloodthirsty Islamist fanatic Sayyid Qutb's work: as something that we have to understand, because it articulates quite clearly what we're up against -- and that it's not mere psychotic raving:

Here's the most important line in the manifesto, one that the rest of us had better have a good answer to, because this assertion, in some form, is going to be with us for the rest of our lives:

RADICALIZATION IS THE RATIONAL RESPONSE TO DEGENERATION

What is ""degeneration""? According to the manifesto, it consists of:

Here's the chilling part: Everything Tarrant identifies as qualities of a disintegrating Western civilization is true. You may think that declining numbers of ethnic Europeans is a good thing, or something that has no particular moral meaning. But it really is happening. So are all the rest.

In no way do I see ""radicalization,"" at least not remotely in the violent terms conceived of by this mass murdering scum, as the answer to the disintegration he identifies. There is never, ever any justification for what he did. But if we are going to figure out how to stop these things, we have to take seriously the roots of it -- this, in the same way we have to recognize the roots of Al-Qaeda and ISIS in specific experiences of Arab Muslims in late modernity. In fact, what Tarrant did, and what the Islamist terrorists do, intersect insofar as they are responses to the profound displacement of peoples and traditions in the modern world.

We are no doubt going to see more Tarrants emerge from the masses of angry young white men radicalized by the world they live in, and from living online. Again, the emergence of the same kind of men from the stresses of Arab Muslim society is entirely predictable.

The temptation many here will have in response to this obscene attack is to deny that it is based in any kind of reality. To do that, though, requires closing one's eyes to actual conditions in the world. It would be like Russian aristocrats, circa 1900, telling themselves that the communist and anarchist revolutionaries committing acts of political murder have nothing to do with social, political, and economic changes roiling Europe and Russia of the era. That they are just inexplicable acts of savagery caused by the reading of revolutionary tracts.

Ian Bogost has an interesting piece explaining why it is impossible to say for sure what Tarrant really meant in this manifesto, and what is sarcasm (e.g., he baited the black American right-wing commenter Candace Owens in his manifesto). Bogost points out that social media, though, is made for creating chaos.

The world is undergoing unprecedented upheavals caused in part by technology, and certainly amplified by technology. This is only going to get more severe. We also live in a time in which masses of people have genuinely been uprooted from all sources of stability. The greatest task for political leaders, it seems to me, is to figure out how to keep society relatively stable during this long period of tumult. Encouraging identity politics and mass immigration, especially during a time of rising social instability, are suicidal for stable polities.

It seems clear to me that it in no way requires one to endorse Tarrant's vile crimes to recognize that like splitting the atom, the unwinding of Western civilization is going to release some extreme energies. It already is. It is simply bizarre to think that all Europeans are going to acquiesce gently in the overwhelming of their nations by immigrants in this century. Most will, I think, but it is reasonable to expect that more and more violent fanatics like Tarrant and his hero Anders Breivik will arise. I believe we should take Tarrant seriously when he says that what radicalized him most of all was traveling to Europe and seeing with his own eyes the withering away of the continent's ancient peoples. His way of responding to it is demonic -- but what he is responding to is real. Douglas Murray's great and sober book The Strange Death Of Europe is the thing to read on this topic.

One last point. In his manifesto, Tarrant says that it's ""laughable"" to expect immigrants to the West to assimilate to a decadent, dying culture like ours. This brought to mind something I heard in New York last week. A man told me that two Romanian immigrant friends of his are thinking of returning to Romania to educate their children because they don't want their kids infected with the decadence transmitted by the US education system. I don't blame him at all. I think of Mark Bollobas's decision to move to Hungary, the country from which his parents defected in the 1960s. Excerpt from something he wrote for this blog late last year:

Like many children of immigrants, I was raised to know that I have to work harder, and be better everywhere than those who were ""local"" to get ahead. And it's all true. But I was also raised in a Hungarian household. While my parents made every effort to assimilate, I was raised in a household that took pride in being Hungarian. I didn't support Hungary in sports or anything tribal like that, but I was proud when Hungary did well. I appreciated the poetry, the folk music, the heritage, the history, and so forth. And every time I went back to Budapest, I felt so so comfortable. No one asks ""where are you from?"" because although I don't sound like I am from here (I have a British accent in Hungarian), I am from here, and people recognize that.

My decision to move back here to Hungary -- I say that even though I wasn't born here -- has been reinforced by this fact: Hungary understands that holding on to its cultural identity is essential to its existence as a society we can understand.

Culture changes over time, of course, but it normally does it slowly as we creep towards a more civilized future.

England doesn't feel more civilized -- quite the opposite. It feels more feral. And the UK has just accepted its fate.

And so, Tarrant's line -- radicalization is the rational response to degeneration -- played out in a different way in Mark Bollobas's life. He moved to his ancestral homeland, where he would be poorer in material ways, but richer in many other ways. In my case, I propose the Benedict Option, and live in consciously countercultural ways, trying to be more and more like this in the face of this increasingly repulsive culture. For his part, Brenton Tarrant became a fanatical racist, fascist, mass murderer. Radicalism takes many forms. We have to resist the berserker form, but resisting it cannot mean pretending that the society and culture we are creating is good and healthy and worth defending. It's not. I mean, for God's sake, just look. I see Tarrant as a manifestation of the same diabolism.

It's more radical to work to build the kind of culture that is life-giving, and to create new forms within which it can be lived out, than to give your life over to murdering innocent men, women, and children. This is true whether you are an ISIS terrorist, or a white nationalist terrorist. Those devils bring nothing but pain and death. They are no solution.

Finally, on the concept of degeneration, look at this old song by a French Canadian band. The song is called, of course, D√©g√©n√©ration. It's about generational loss of spirit and culture:

Some people who live through this turn into bloodthirsty maniacs, like Brenton Tarrant. There is a better way. There has to be. It's not going to come through the Democratic or Republican parties, and it's not going to come through the established institutions of the church or academia. Nor can you buy it on Amazon.com. The materials are there to make it ourselves, but it requires discipline and community. As I've said.",297,The American Conservative,Radicalization & Degeneration
"With the news of the largest college admissions cheating scandal all over today's headlines, one might wonder how students, who really earned their way into these schools, became such smart, high-achievers. Some experts might say it's in their genes while others question whether luck is really the biggest driver. But a new book called ""The Formula"" unveils how parenting may be the key factor in determining whether individuals will ever reach their full potential.

Co-authors Ronald Ferguson, the director of Harvard's Achievement Gap Initiative and award-winning journalist Tatsha Robertson interviewed hundreds of successful adults and their parents to come up with eight major roles that ""master parents"" must fulfill in order to raise smart, high-achieving children, no matter what background they come from. In fact, the book describes how ""regardless of material resources, these parents exhibited intense commitment and vision"" when it came to raising their children, a skill that is not by chance, but is purposeful.

According to Ferguson and Robertson, the early-learning partner spends a lot of time with the child in brain-building play and literacy activities starting from birth to age 5. Early play can include playing with blocks, reading flash cards or learning an instrument, but it's an activity that ""stimulates the brain in a way that inspires discipline, imagination and critical thinking.""

The book points to an example of a 2016 study out of the University of Indiana that illustrated how playing with blocks can reorganize the brain during play.

""It changed the way the children were solving the mental rotation problem; we saw increased activation in regions that have been linked to spatial processing...""

Ferguson and Robertson included dozens of stories from parents who come from different educational backgrounds.

""There was one young man who grew up in a homeless shelter. His mother would teach him how to read on a couch of a homeless shelter showing little flash cards. He ended up going to Harvard,"" Robertson said. ""But she started so early and he was learning so much so that by the time he was in kindergarten he was already ahead.""

Ferguson said that these ""master parents,"" the ones who were following this so-called formula they discovered, were students of their children.

""You get to know your child so well that you know what the right time and place is for a particular kind of activity with a particular child,"" he said.

The Flight Engineer

Once the child has entered school, this role monitors and manages all the people and systems working on behalf of the child.

""If you think of life as a journey, high achievers are on a high flight trajectory and the flight engineer makes sure that if anything starts to go off track they intervene,"" Ferguson said.

Ferguson described a story in which one parent intervened when a teacher started leaving frowny faces on their child's papers. The flight engineer parent looks at this as something that is threatening their child's confidence.

""The parent just went in and said 'there will be no more frowny faces on my child's paper. Even if the work's not good it should be a smiley face if there's going to be a face there,'"" Ferguson explained.

The Fixer

Similar to the flight engineer, the fixer is also a problem solver. But this type of problem does not necessarily involve a third party that the parent has to work with to solve the problem. Instead, the parent has to come up with a solution on their own. The fixer is resourceful in fixing the type of problems that threaten opportunities for their child, often making sacrifices, whether they be ""relinquishing prized possessions, making significant life changes, or devoting large amounts of personal time to continue their child's momentum.""

Robinson relayed another story that involved a struggling family who made extreme sacrifices for their child. He said the mother knew her daughter was a member of this high-achieving group of friends that were all joining the orchestra in the eighth grade. She was the only one that came from a lower income background so her mother, the fixer, sacrificed her wedding ring so her daughter could stay in that same group and feel confident.

""The young lady wanted to play the flute and she had to have that because she was a top student,"" he said. ""But how could she be a top student without the instrument that she needed. And the mom decided she was going to sell her wedding ring to make sure it happened, and it changed her life.""

FELICITY HUFFMAN'S 'DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES' CHARACTER GAVE $15G TO GET TWINS INTO PRIVATE SCHOOL

The Revealer

As a revealer, the parent exposes their kid to new things or they ""deepen the child's knowledge of the things they already know."" This can expand their imagination and perhaps expand their vision of their future possibilities. Ferguson and Robertson said Albert Einstein's parents were great examples of this.

""They had family friends who were mathematicians and scientists who they'd have over for dinner or lunch and Einstein would interact with them,"" Ferguson said. ""Sometimes they would become a tutor for Einstein, so there's all kinds of exposure that the revealer provides.""

The book describes how by the ages of 8 and 10, high achievers began developing interests in specific topics like music, zoology or politics. So the parent as a revealer would work on finding more opportunities for their children to ""indulge and further those interests.""

The Philosopher

""One of the things that really distinguishes highly successful people is that they have a sense of purpose and their sense of agency to go for it,"" Ferguson said. ""And the philosopher helps a child find that sense of purpose to establish a moral compass and to have answers to life's big questions that can help to guide them and keep them on track.""

Ferguson also explained how the philosopher is a good listener. In order to be a student of your child you have to listen to them.

""When a child poses questions, particularly deep important questions, the philosopher gives it some thought,"" Ferguson said. ""We have one parent who would walk away for two or three days and think about it and then come back with an answer.""

"Former Texas congressman officially announces he will run for president in 2020.

Beto O'Rourke praised the Green New Deal as he launched his presidential campaign Thursday, saying some will criticize the plan for ""being too bold or being unmanageable"" but ""I haven't seen anything better that addresses this singular crisis we face.""

A few hours after the comments in Keokuk, Iowa, O'Rourke called for suspending the federal death penalty, telling Radio Iowa: ""It's not an equitable, fair, just system right now."" And he opened the door to packing the Supreme Court with more justices.

BETO O'ROURKE MAKES IT OFFICIAL WITH EARLY MORNING 2020 LAUNCH

These are just the latest examples of a lawmaker who had a bipartisan streak in Congress increasingly shifting left as he sets out on his White House run. But they also highlight a dilemma for the 2020 field's newest contestant: What lane is he running in?

It remains far from clear whether O'Rourke considers himself a liberal competing for the supporters of, say, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- or a more moderate, center-left figure in the style of former Vice President Joe Biden, who could jump into the race at any moment.

PRESIDENT TRUMP MOCKS BETO O'ROURKE

In the press, lately he has been branded as the latter. Earlier this week, The Washington Post declared in a headline: ""O'Rourke and Biden, signaling presidential bids, would infuse centrism into a left-leaning Democratic field.""

To be sure, O'Rourke has described himself as a capitalist -- hardly a radical step, but a statement that would put him at odds with beacons of the left like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who says capitalism is ""irredeemable.""

But Republicans argue O'Rourke is clearly tacking left.

The Republican National Committee blasted him for supporting ""extreme policies like government-run health care and tearing down border barriers."" Matt Wolking, the incoming deputy director of communications for rapid response for President Trump's re-election campaign, mocked The Washington Post's headline.

""Hilarious take from WaPo. Beto O'Rourke wants to tear down existing border walls, abolish ICE, allow abortion until birth, institute a single payer health care system, and impeach the president. So centrist!"" he tweeted.

O'Rourke is well aware of how his ideological alignment is open to interpretation.

""In Texas, Ted Cruz called me a socialist. I'm too liberal for Texas. Outside of Texas, people say, 'Is he really a Democrat? I think he's a closet Republican,'"" O'Rourke highlighted at an event last month in Wisconsin.

""I don't know where I am on a spectrum, and I almost could care less,"" he added.

During three terms representing El Paso and surrounding areas in Texas in Congress, though, O'Rourke built up a reputation as a moderate Democrat willing to reach bipartisan compromise.

Along with a small number of House Democrats, he voted against an oil export ban and rejected an amendment which would have barred spending on research for offshore oil drilling.

The votes were typical for O'Rourke, whose outreach to Republicans was cited during his Senate run by numerous newspaper editorial boards, including the El Paso Times. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight found that in his final year in Congress, O'Rourke sided with the Trump administration 30 percent of the time, and ProPublica data showed he was among the top 20 percent of Democrats most willing to buck his own party.

O'Rourke also did not co-sponsor top progressive wish-list items - like tuition-free college at public institutions and ""Medicare-for-all.""

And instead of joining the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he became a member of the more moderate New Democrat Coalition.

But during his Senate run and in the ensuing months, he's burnished his progressive credentials -- for instance, calling for existing wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to be dismantled. He's also called for legalizing marijuana.

When it comes to stricter firearms laws to curb gun violence, he supports universal background checks, backs banning bump stocks and AR-15-style rifles, and opposes concealed-carry reciprocity between states. On social issues, he grabbed national attention in August when he defended NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality.

But when it comes to another top item for progressives, Medicare-for-all, O'Rourke has kept the door open. He backs a pathway to universal health coverage but says it doesn't necessarily have to be achieved through a single-payer model.

""I think Medicare-for-all is one of the possible paths. I think the fastest way to get there is to ensure that people who have insurance that they like through their employer are able to keep it and we complement that with those who can purchase Medicare,"" he told CBS News.

The contrast between O'Rourke's record in Congress and most of his stances in the past year, as he ran for the Senate and now the White House, has been highlighted numerous times in the media.

And it's opened him up to the same kind of criticism that Democratic presidential contender Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is facing. Gillibrand was considered a moderate Democrat when she represented a congressional district in upstate New York. But after becoming a senator representing the entire state of New York, she moved to the left on some key policies.

But a top Democratic strategist argued that the labels might not matter much in the end.

""No one outside of the hardcore activists base is looking at the labels of who's a progressive and who's a moderate, said Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor.

""Voters want to know who is this person? Can they get the job done? Do they get me? And can they beat Donald Trump?"" explained Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

But he added that with O'Rourke being an open book, the candidate ""has this kind of quality about him that people seem to project what they want - their own sort of hopes - onto him.""

Eilleithee said that can be a ""blessing and a curse.""",299,Fox News,Beto's identity crisis: Is Dem darling a liberal or a moderate?

Heading into this year's contest Moss had won 40 Ellies in his 15-year tenure, while Remnick took home 44 trophies over the course of 20 years at the helm.

In the final showdown, it was Remnick by a technical knockout, with the judges from the American Society of Magazine Editors awarding him four new Ellies.

Moss, 61, added only one more Golden Elephant, as the statues are also known, for leisure interests for the story ""How To Be an Artist"" by Jerry Saltz, boosting Moss' career total to 41. He was also inducted into the Magazine Editors Hall of Fame in a moving tribute.

Remnick's haul means that The New Yorker has won 48 times since he took the helm in 1998.

ASME judges snubbed the two biggest magazine giants. Although they had a handful of nominations, no mags from Hearst or Meredith made it to the winners circle.

The awards ceremony was moderated by CNN's John Avlon, a former chief editor of the Daily Beast, and was held at the East Williamsburg music venue Brooklyn Steel, marking the first time in the 54-year history of the prestigious honors that they were held outside Manhattan.

The highlight of the night was the standing ovation that was given to Moss upon his induction into the Magazine Editors Hall of Fame.

""Reporting, writing, photography and design, the 67 magazines and Web sites we honored tonight do it all,"" said ASME CEO Sid Holt.

""But what made the occasion especially significant -- and especially touching for many readers and journalists who have been influenced by his work -- was the presentation of ASME's Hall of Fame Award to one of the most thoughtful and innovative editors of our time, Adam Moss,"" Holt said.

A humbled Moss quipped, ""Thirty-five years of work reduced to a 150-second video.

""This organization has been very good to me for a long time. The first time I stood on an Ellie stage, Dan Quayle was still vice president of the United States, they were still making episodes of 'Golden Girls.'

""And the event was at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan.

""I really am ancient. I really want to express my gratitude to you for all the kindness you have shown me over the years,"" Moss said.

""But here's the thing. Every bit of the work you saw on the screen was done by somebody -- editors, photographers, writers,"" he added. ""An editor's job is really to trick other people to do all the work. I am really a grateful and lucky guy,"" Moss said, before he thanked Pam Wasserstein -- New York Media CEO -- for ""letting me be a part of a great family business.""

Only two magazines won more than one Ellie this year.

Topic won two awards in the video category, one for service and lifestyle and the other for news and opinion. Also, the New York Times Magazine took home two, including one for digital innovation and another for essays and criticism.

ASME judges also handed out general excellence Ellies in four categories.

In the highly competitive news, sports and entertainment category, National Geographic won its eighth Ellie, besting The Marshall Project, New York, Time and Wired.

T: The New York Times Style Magazine won general excellence in the service and lifestyle category for the second year in a row.

The other two general excellence awards went to upstart titles: Kazoo, which won for special interests, and to Virginia Quarterly, which won its second general excellence in the literature, science and politics category.

Bill Keller, a one-time top editor at the New York Times, said in November he is stepping down from his latest gig atop the not-for-profit The Marshall Project, but was in Brooklyn to accept the award for best Web site in the news and opinion category. Keller said he will stay on until a replacement is found.

Popular Science won best single topic issue for one entitled ""The Tiny Issue,"" while personal service was taken by 5280 magazine in something of an upset with ""The Art of Dying Well,"" beating out Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Outside and Women's Health.

In other awards, Wired won for design and photography.

GQ Style won for service and lifestyle.

Roads & Kingdoms, the travel journalist Web site, was honored for service and lifestyle, although nobody was present to accept. Master of Ceremonies Avlon said he would accept the Ellie on behalf of the late Anthony Bourdain, who was a co-founder.

Bon Appetit won for Social Media.

"National security and foreign analyst Dr. Walid Phares says the New Zealand mass shooting is a successful act of pure evil.

Word of a terrorist attack is always jolting, whether it comes via a phone call in the middle of the night, the morning news spilling from the alarm clock, or an email breaking into an ordinary day at the office.

When news of such an unspeakable event breaks, I start getting media queries almost immediately. They all ask the same question: What does this mean?

I am now sadly practiced at processing atrocities like the appalling shootings in New Zealand.

NEW ZEALAND SHOOTING VICTIM'S 'COURAGEOUS' LAST WORDS TO GUNMAN GO VIRAL

There is a list of questions I always ask myself in order to make sense of the senseless.

What happened?

Despite the temptation to rush to judgment, my rule is to wait for the facts, and let the facts speak for themselves. In this case, the facts came out really fast, in part because the perpetrators broadcasted them to the world. The shootings at the Christchurch mosques are the very definition of terrorism: the willful intention to do violence on innocents to serve a political agenda.

Who is to blame?

In cases of terrorism my answer is always the same: the terrorists. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was exactly right when she said that people with such extreme views ""have absolutely no place in New Zealand and in fact have no place in the world. ... We utterly reject and condemn you."" Shifting the blame to anyone else is just wrong. Terrorists should be made to own their evil.

What about whataboutism?

There are always some who want to make a tragedy about their agenda. That agenda may be gun control, politics, religion, or any number of other concerns, hatreds, conspiracies or righteous causes. But trying to make the issue about their cause and not about terrorism does nothing to advance our understanding of either - especially when people are in the midst of crisis, tragedy and mourning.

Take issues on their own merit. We don't need a terrorist attack to argue that an extremist ideology that dehumanizes people of another religion or embraces xenophobia is wrong. We can argue that every day.

What about the terrorist threat?

All terrorism is terrible, but it is not all equal. Terrorist groups that are organized and supported by global networks, or directed by state-sponsors like Iran, represent systemic threats to national security and the peace and prosperity of societies. Individual acts of terrorism, even horrific acts of terror such as these mosque attacks, are extreme public safety challenges. Each should be handled with the resources and means appropriate to the nature of the threat.

It is also worth remembering that if we add up all the terrorists in the world, including terrorists such as those in New Zealand, they are but a minuscule fraction of any race, religion, or any other group of humanity.

Acts of terrorism can be quite telling in terms of understanding who we are - the good and the bad. In their wake, we see leadership, like the compassionate, firm and steady hand of Prime Minister Ardern. We see our capacity for caring and empathy, like the many people all over the world who stand with the people of New Zealand this morning, praying for them, their losses, and their future. And we see the exploiters, the hate-mongers, and the manipulators.

What does the horror in New Zealand mean? You have my answer to these questions. What are yours?",301,Fox News,"New Zealand mosque shooting: As a national security expert, here's how I try to make sense of the senseless"
"Over the past several weeks, Breitbart News has shown beyond any reasonable doubt that CNN's reporting is false. It seems likely the result of deliberate editorial policy.

The facts are simple enough -- because CNN reported them correctly in August 2017, when President Trump made the ""very fine people"" remark at a press conference, his third public statement about the Charlottesville riots.

Trump condemned the neo-Nazis and other extremist groups on the right and the left, while noting that some of the people present on both sides were not extremists and had attempted to stage a legitimate protest.

On the right, that protest was against the removal of a statue of Confederate war hero General Robert E. Lee, and the renaming of the park in which the statue had been erected decades before. On the left, the legitimate protest consisted of peaceful counter-demonstrations against those in favor of the statue, as well as against the hordes of neo-Nazis and white supremacists who had hijacked the statue issue for their own evil purposes.

There was also legitimate criticism to be made of the president's response -- not at the press conference, but several days before, on Aug. 12, 2017, when he first reacted to Charlottesville. He condemned ""violence on many sides,"" but did not single out the neo-Nazis or, indeed, the left-wing Antifa thugs who battled them in the streets. (Former President Barack Obama also reacted without naming any specific group on either side.)

To Trump's many critics, that was not enough. Many of them believed he had a special duty to condemn the neo-Nazis because some on the extreme right supported him for president in 2016. And no matter how often Trump disavowed them, his critics continued to link him to them, partly because they felt his disavowals had not been strong enough, and partly because literally every Republican candidate is accused of being Hitler.

So in response, Trump issued a second statement -- before the Charlottesville press conference. Speaking from the White House on Aug. 14, 2017, the president singled out the extreme right: ""Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" he said, as reported by CNN.

He condemned them again at the now-infamous Aug. 15, 2017 press conference at Trump Tower in New York City. His comment about ""very fine people"" excluded neo-Nazis. It referred speficially to those ""who came out to protest the removal of Robert E. Lee's statue,"" CNN reported. (Trump predicted other, less offensive, statues would follow; indeed, this month, a California city removed a statue of President William McKinley.)

For the last several weeks, major anchors, reporters, and contributors at CNN have falsely reported that the ""very fine people"" comment referred to neo-Nazis. Chris Cuomo, Anderson Cooper, and others have even edited video deceptively for the purpose, showing footage of white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, then cutting to footage of President Trump talking about ""very fine people"" as if he were referring to them.

In addition, when Democrats like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) have made false claims about Charlottesville on CNN shows, the network's hosts have not bothered to correct them. (They are not shy to correct the president or his surrogates, even when they are arguably in the right.) None of the CNN executives, hosts, or reporters whom Breitbart News contacted has returned comment, nor has the network disputed Breitbart's reporting.

The latest example occurred Thursday evening, when CNN's Erin Burnett hosted Republican Steve Cortes and Democrat Keith Boykin. When Boykin said, ""When violent people were actually marching with tiki torches in Charlottesville, the president said they were 'very fine people',"" Cortes tried to correct him: ""No, he did not say that ... No, on both sides of the monument debate. That's an incredibly important dissociation.""

Burnett, looking disgusted, shook her head and said: ""He didn't say it was on the monument debate at all. No. They didn't even try to use that defense. It's a good one, but no one's even tried to use it. So you just used it now.""

Perhaps Burnett simply does not know: perhaps she has never read the transcript of Trump's remarks, or CNN's own reporting at the time. Regardless, her response was wrong -- but consistent with network policy.

The lie about ""very fine people"" in Charlottesville is not an ordinary factual error. It is a hoax, one of the most divisive myths in American politics, scaring millions into believing their president sides with violent right-wing extremists.

The normally hyperactive media ""fact-checkers"" are also complicit in their silence about CNN's fraudulent reporting. It has gone on too long.

"According to his manifesto, the shooter -- who massacred civilians at two mosques in New Zealand's city of Christchurch -- appears to subscribe to a number of ideologies. The document is riddled with white nationalist talking points, and the shooter describes himself as a ""fascist."" He also castigates Muslims as ""the most despised group of invaders in the west.""

Yet elsewhere in the document, the shooter describes himself as a socialist, ""depending on the definition."" The shooter also declares his support for ""environmentalism,"" ""worker's rights,"" and ""responsible markets.""

On the one hand, the manifesto presents the political left as an enemy that conducted a ""march through the institutions"" and describes Antifa, communists, and Marxists as ""anti-white scum."" Elsewhere, the shooter writes that ""under some definitions,"" he is both on the right and the left.

Elsewhere, the shooter disparages conservatism and declines to identify with it, writing that ""conservatism is dead, thank god,"" and calling it ""corporatism in disguise."" Conservatives, he says, ""don't even believe in the race, they don't have the gall to say race exists"" and ""don't even care if it does.""

""The notion of a racial future or destiny is as foreign to them as social responsibilities.""

Parts of the manifesto appear to be insincere trolling, aimed at sowing confusion about his motivations. At one point, the shooter blames his action on popular video game titles, saying ""Spyro the Dragon 3 taught me ethno-nationalism"" and that ""Fortnite trained me to be a killer.""

Elsewhere in the document, the shooter identifies black conservative Candace Owens -- obviously neither a white nationalist nor a supporter of violence -- as the ""person that has influenced me above all."" In a video posted online, the shooter also tells viewers to ""subscribe to PewDiePie"" -- the pseudonym of Felix Kjellberg, a comedian and video game streamer who runs the most-subscribed channel on YouTube and whose content is majority non-political.

In both cases, the shooter attempts to link high-profile individuals -- who have little in common with his stated ideology yet command large online followings and are frequently the target of unfair media hit pieces -- to his attack. If it triggers a war of words between the media and their frequent targets, the result of this tactic would be more publicity for the shooter.

At three points in his manifesto, the shooter also states his intention to spark a civil war in the United States by triggering crackdowns on the Second Amendment. In his laundry list of motivations, the shooter spends the most amount of time discussing this goal, which he believes will ultimately lead to a ""fracturing"" of the U.S. along ""cultural and racial lines.""

As he describes it, his attack will ""Create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political, and racial divide within the United States.""

""This conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will eventually result in a civil war that will Balkanize the U.S. along political, cultural, and most importantly racial lines.""

Elsewhere in the manifesto, the shooter predicts that his attack will lead to ""calls for the removal of gun rights from whites in the United States... that is the plan all along.""

While the shooter lists a number of highly lethal methods he might have used to carry out the act of terrorism, he states that he chose firearms ""for the effect it would have on social discourse, the extra media coverage they would provide and the effect it would have on the politics of the United States and thereby the political situation of the world.""

""With enough pressure the left wing within the United States will seek to abolish the second amendment, and the right wing within the U.S. will see this as an attack on their very freedom and liberty. The attempted abolishment of rights by the left will result in a dramatic polarization of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the U.S. along cultural and racial lines.""",303,Breitbart,New Zealand Shooter Hopes for U.S. Civil War Sparked by Gun Debate
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reportedly issues warning to moderate Democrats

There is no evidence that New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bribed her way into college or cheated on the SAT. By all accounts, Boston University admitted the freshman congresswoman on her own merits, which distinguishes her from the children of wealthy parents arrested on Tuesday for paying over $25 million to cheat their kids' way into colleges across the country.

Harvard professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz called the enterprise ""the worst scandal involving elite universities in the history of the United States."" Unfortunately, admissions fraud is the least of the nation's academic problems - a symptom, rather than the cause, of the degradation of American higher education.

What unknown fact does the scandal expose? Wealthy parents have long relied on a properly timed donation to improve their children's chances at admission to college. And it isn't just the wealthy who play the system to gain an advantage. Legacies, athletes, and favored racial minorities all receive preferential treatment from admissions committees to the exclusion of academically better-qualified students.

MICHAEL KNOWLES: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ IS LEADING DEMOCRATS TO DEFEAT IN 2020

American universities have never considered academic merit the sole criterion for admittance. The parents caught up in Tuesday's sting simply exploited this reality to a criminal extreme.

An even more troubling question is not how the deficient students matriculated but how they graduated. Over his six-decade career at Harvard, Professor Harvey Mansfield has witnessed grade inflation reach such ludicrous heights that he now gives students two different grades: one that will appear on their transcripts and another that they deserve.

In 2017, Yale changed its course requirements such that an English major may now graduate without ever having read Shakespeare. A 2007 survey from the Intercollegiate Studies Institute showed that college students graduate with less knowledge of history, politics, and economics than they had before they entered. The admissions scam succeeded for so long because everyone knew once the sub-par students made it into these schools they were unlikely to encounter any real scholarly rigor.

So what is a college degree worth these days? Millennial congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez majored in Economics and graduated cum laude from a private university that costs nearly $70,000 per year. Since entering Congress, she has struggled to articulate even basic economic concepts.

Last month, AOC blocked Amazon from relocating tens of thousands of jobs near her congressional district because she failed to understand the difference between a tax incentive and a slush fund. On Tuesday, during congressional testimony, Ocasio-Cortez appeared bemused as Wells Fargo CEO explained the basic function of a bank. If Ocasio-Cortez represents the quality of an Economics degree from BU, the university should lose its accreditation.

The liberal arts enable us to understand and earn our liberty. Unlike professional and mechanical education, the liberal arts do not train students for any particular job. They are literally the arts of freedom, and no society that abandons liberal education can remain free for long. Unfortunately, the left's decades-long effort to subvert liberal education through pseudo-academic disciplines, administrative bloat, and outright censorship have transformed even our nation's most elite universities into little more than decadent indoctrination camps.

Compounding the problem, the leveling myth that every American regardless of aptitude or interest ought to receive precisely the same education has saddled an entire generation with a trillion and a half dollars of student debt and degrees worth less than the paper on which they were printed.

The wealthy parents who cheated their children's way into college committed a relatively minor crime, akin to petty theft. The greater criminals are the academic arsonists who have burned down our institutions of higher learning. In a democratic republic, our legislators are as benighted or enlightened as our voters.

"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia - Slovakia could get its first woman president as voters elect a new head of state on Saturday.

The leading contenders are Zuzana Caputova, an environmental activist who is in favor of gay rights and opposes a ban on abortion in this conservative Roman Catholic country, and Maros Sefcovic, an establishment figure who is the European Commission Vice-President.

In all, 13 candidates are vying to become the country's fifth head of state since Slovakia gained independence in 1993 after Czechoslovakia split in two.

Andrej Kiska, a successful businessman-turned-philanthropist, is not standing for a second five-year term in the largely ceremonial post.

His term in office was marked by clashes with former prime minister Robert Fico, considered a populist leader.

Kiska supported the huge street protests that led to the fall of Fico's coalition government amid a political crisis triggered by the slayings last year of an investigative reporter and his fiancee. The reporter, Jan Kuciak, was investigating possible widespread government corruption and Italian mob influence.

If no single candidate wins a majority on Saturday, a runoff will be held on March 30 in this central European nation of 5.4 million people.

The president has the power to pick the prime minister, appoint Constitutional Court judges and veto laws. Parliament can override the veto with a simple majority, however. The government, led by the prime minister, possesses most executive powers.

Caputova, a 45-year-old lawyer, is a rising star of Slovak politics. She became known for leading a successful fight against a toxic waste dump in her home town of Pezinok near the capital of Bratislava, for which she received an international environmental prize in 2016. She was also part of a campaign in 2017 that led to the annulment of pardons granted by former authoritarian prime minister Vladimir Meciar. She is deputy chairman of ""Progressive Slovakia,"" a non-parliamentary party that supported the massive street protests after Kuciak's death.

Maros Sefcovic

A career diplomat, 52-year-old Sefcovic was a member of the Communist Party before the anti-Communist 1989 Velvet Revolution. Sefcovic accepted an offer to stand from Fico's leftist Smer-Social Democracy party, a dominant political group in Slovakia in recent years whose reputation has been tarnished by corruption scandals.

A former justice minister and chief judge of the Supreme Court, 61-year-old Harabin was a close ally of Meciar, whose rule in the 1990s was marred by repeated flouting of the law. A populist, Harabin exploits the fear of migration and presents himself as a guardian of traditional conservative values. As a vocal opponent of the sanctions against Russia for its actions against Ukraine, Harabin is a favorite candidate of pro-Russian media.

Marian Kotleba, 42

The 42-year-old heads the neo-Nazi People's Party Our Slovakia, which has 14 lawmakers in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament. Kotleba and his party speak admiringly of Slovakia's time as a Nazi puppet state during World War II. Party members use Nazi salutes and consider NATO a terror group. They want Slovakia to leave the military alliance and the European Union.

Caputova and Sefcovic are predicted by polls to be the two candidates to advance to a runoff. But the last polls allowed were published two weeks before Saturday's ballot. Analysts say there's a room for a surprise result, particularly for Harabin who was running third in the polls.",305,Fox News,Slovakia could get its first woman president in ballot
"The 28-year-old white supremacist who livestreamed himself slaughtering Muslims inside a New Zealand mosque said he hoped the massacre, among other things, would spark a civil war in the United States.

In a twisted 74-page manifesto, Australian citizen Brenton Tarrant describes his anti-immigrant motives for unleashing the rampage at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch , saying the victims were a ""large group of invaders"" who ""seek to occupy my peoples lands and ethnically replace my own people (sic).""

He calls himself ""just a regular White man, from a regular family. Who decided to take a stand to ensure a future for my people,"" adding that he is ""a private and mostly introverted person.""

""I had little interest in education during my schooling, barely achieving a passing grade. I did not attend University as I had no great interest in anything offered in the Universities to study,"" he writes, adding that he has been working as a ""kebab removalist.""

He also admits he is racist and is an ""Eco-fascist by nature.""

Tarrant poses the question about why he carried out the attack, then listed more than a dozen reasons.

""To most of all show the invaders that our lands will never be their lands, our homelands are our own and that, as long as a white man still lives, they will NEVER conquer our lands and they will never replace our people,"" he says.

""To take revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by foreign invaders in European lands throughout history,"" he continues.

""To take revenge for the enslavement of millions of Europeans taken from their lands by the Islamic slavers,"" he says. ""To take revenge for the thousands of European lives lost to terror attacks throughout European lands.""

He says he also wanted ""to create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political and racial divide within the United states.

""This conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines.""

Tarrant also says he wanted to take revenge for Ebba Akerlund, an 11-year-old girl killed in a 2017 terror attack in Stockholm.

He describes that attack as the ""first event"" that inspired him to commit the heinous crime in Christchurch.

""Young, innocent and dead Ebba. Ebba was walking to meet her mother after school, when she was murdered by an Islamic attacker, driving a stolen vehicle through the shopping promenade on which she was walking. Ebba was partially deaf, unable to hear the attacker coming,"" he writes.

""Ebba death at the hands of the invaders, the indignity of her violent demise and my inability to stop it broke through my own jaded cynicism like a sledgehammer.

""I could no longer ignore the attacks. They were attacks on my people, attacks on my culture, attacks on my faith and attacks on my soul. They would not be ignored.""

He says a trip he took to France in 2017 inspired the attack.

""For many years I had been hearing and reading of the invasion of France by non-whites, many of these rumors and stories I believed to be exaggerations, created to push a political narrative.

""But once I arrived in France, I found the stories not only be true, but profoundly understated. In every French city, in every French town the invaders were there.""

Citing the 2017 French general election he adds:

""The candidates were an obvious sign of our times: a globalist, capitalist, egalitarian, an ex-investment banker was no national beliefs other than the pursuit of profit versus a milquetoast,feckless, civic nationalist, an uncontroversial figure who's most brave and inspired idea resolved to the possible deportation of illegal immigrants.""

Tarrant notes that he does not belong to any organizations or groups - but that he has ""donated"" to many nationalist groups ""and interacted with many more.""

He also says he was not seeking fame.

""Carrying out an attack for fame would be laughable. After all who can remember the name of the attackers in the September 11 attack in New York?"" he writes.

""How about the attack on the pentagon? The attackers in the plane that crashed into the field on the same day? I will be forgotten quickly. Which I do not mind.

He says he targeted the Muslim worshipers because ""they were an obvious,visible and large group of invaders, from a culture with higher fertility rates, higher social trust and strong, robust traditions that seek to occupy my peoples lands and ethnically replace my own people.""

Tarrant also reveals that New Zealand was not his original choice for an attack, saying he only traveled to the country to plan and train for an attack.

""I begun planning an attack roughly two years in advance and an attack at the location in Christchurch three months in advance,"" he said.

He notes he had the ""will"" and ""resources"" to use a variety of weapons to commit the heinous act, including an explosives-laden van and a plane - but that he chose guns ""for the affect it would have on social discourse, the extra media coverage they would provide and the affect it could have on the politics of United states and thereby the political situation of the world.""

He adds: ""The US is torn into many factions by its second amendment, along state, social, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines.

""With enough pressure the left wing within the United states will seek to abolish the second amendment, and the right wing within the US will see this as an attack on their very freedom and liberty.

""This attempted abolishment of rights by the left will result in a dramatic polarization of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the US along cultural and racial lines.""

He also poses the question of whether he supports President Trump.

""As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no,"" he answers.",306,New York Post,Suspected New Zealand mosque shooter hoped to spark civil war in US
"Tension between art and politics marks the new documentary The Eyes of Orson Welles. The strain begins as director Mark Cousins circles around the enormity of his subject -- as if interest in genius and Renaissance man Welles needed sociological justification. Beginning far afield with a camera panning Times Square, Cousins muses about Obama, Trump, and the modern age (""What would you have done with the Internet, Orson?""). But this proves unnecessary once Welles's art -- his debut feature film Citizen Kane -- is foregrounded.

Cousins soon gets to the memorable flirtation scene between publishing tycoon Kane (played by Welles) and working-class singer Susan Alexander: ""I'm wriggling both ears at the same time. It took me two years in the best boarding school in the world to learn that trick. The boy that taught it to me is now president of Venezuela."" The scene's suddenly timely coincidence is amusing, but such prophetic irony is proof of Welles's artistic resonance that transcends politics.

Welles's interest in the Shakespearean complexity of human personality informs his masterpieces (Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight, F for Fake, and so many others). Using a newly discovered cache of personal drawings and paintings by Welles, Cousins makes connections that emphasize the visual intent and virtuosity that stemmed from both Welles's pictorial training and innate talent.

As a cultural figure, Welles advanced cinematic expression and modernized ideas about the art form's potential. Often standing for humanist causes (""I'm rather fond of chivalry and honor. I'm interested in outmoded virtues,"" he explained about his Don Quixote project), Welles reflected the noblesse oblige of a wealthy man with classical education. Yet Cousins frequently refers to Welles's activism -- that infernal Millennials canard -- when recounting Welles's progressive WPA theater venture The Cradle Will Rock (1937). Cousins also highlights some startling public statements that combined an impressario's grandstanding and moral authority spoken with basso profundo theatricality.

During a public Q&A after screening his adaptation of Kafka's The Trial, Welles cuts off a question about changing Kafka's ending to boom, ""Because the book was written before the Holocaust!"" Welles goes on to declare, ""I couldn't bear the defeat of [protagonist] K in the book after the Holocaust! I'm not Jewish, but since the Holocaust, we are all Jewish. And I couldn't bear for him to submit to death as he does in Kafka, masochistically submit to death. It stank of the old Prague ghetto to me.""

Welles's ability to work an audience and manipulate an emotional effect was driven by more than political sympathy. But Cousins alters that fellow-feeling into strident politics.

Arguably the most graphically attuned of all American filmmakers, in his films Welles lays emphasis on vision as part of our human capacity and a key means of our moral understanding. Cousins uses a double meaning for ""Eyes"" through poignant reference to Welles's social awareness: A 1955 six-part BBC TV series, Orson Welles Sketchbook, was highlighted by Welles telling the true-life tragedy of black World War II veteran Isaac Woodard. In 1946, Woodard was brutalized by a South Carolina policeman who ""had literally beaten out his eyes."" Welles denounced the atrocity as bringing ""the justice of Dachau and Auschwitz to America.""

Cousins (and co-producer Michael Moore) insert this disturbing history as another instance to support the idea of Welles's activism. (Welles's accusation is a bit of an overstatement, but its terrible linkage illustrates a combination of historical judgment and modern consciousness that is fundamental to our moral thinking.)

Yet, this is also where Cousins abuses his own film scholarship. The Isaac Woodard incident is recalled for its own ugly sake; Cousins doesn't take enough time to draw parallels with the bulging eyes and abuse of authority in Touch of Evil (1958). That film is actually the opposite of self-promoting showbiz activism -- such as Oprah Winfrey exploiting the Recy Taylor story at the Golden Globes to justify her own ""truth."" Welles's U.S. border film goes far beyond indicting police misconduct by examining everything around it with deep moral vision. In Sketchbook, he told the BBC, ""It's the essence of our society that a policeman's job should be hard. ... We should be grateful, too, for the laws which protect us against the policeman."" That statement may sound like ""activism,"" but Touch of Evil (like Morrissey's recent Venezuela song ""Who Will Protect Us From The Police?"") is most powerful as art.

The tension between art and politics is central to the current dilemma of documentary as a new media vogue. (British film scholar Cousins previously made the 2011 The Story of Film: An Odyssey, an exhaustive and at times fatuous overview, in the manner of egoistic TV presenters such as Ken Burns and Bill Moyers.) This commodification of biased ""truth"" (with emphasis on ""activism"" and ""justice"") threatens to ruin popular culture. Cousins gives little time to Welles's innovation of the form in F for Fake (about art forger Elmyr de Hory), which might show us how documentary technique can be best used. Despite stretching irrelevant similarities between Welles's sketchbooks and his great films (comparisons that are fun to watch rather than enlightening), Cousins's political focus misses the moral core of Welles's art.

Throughout The Eyes of Orson Welles, Cousins repeats a color photograph of Welles wearing a blue jacket with a green sweater poking out of the sleeve, lying across a bed and looking toward the camera. Welles, captured in his prime, is casually intense and impenetrable. At least credit Cousins for finding a perfect portrait of the artist outside of the artist's own works.",307,nationalreview.com,'Eyes of Orson Welles' Explores the Filmmaker's Art
"The alleged college-admissions bribery ring exposed earlier this week has something to enrage everyone.

The college-admissions scandal should be the populist issue of our time.

Most of the talk in our politics about how ""the system is rigged"" is incredibly abstract and symbolic. But this is infuriatingly concrete.

On Tuesday, the Justice Department revealed a massive effort by wealthy parents and a shady ""admissions consultant"" to bribe and cheat their way into getting kids into a slew of elite schools.

Prosecutors say William Singer, the ringleader of the operation, sold two forms of services. For tens of thousands of dollars, parents could pay for their kids to have a proctor correct their incorrect answers as they took the SAT. Or, if that wouldn't do the trick, parents could pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe coaches at elite schools to designate applicants as desired athletes, thus circumventing the minimum requirements for grades and test scores.

In one case, a California family allegedly paid $1.2 million to Singer, who in turn allegedly paid Rudy Meredith, the women's soccer coach at Yale, $400,000 to claim that the family's daughter was a coveted recruit even though she didn't play at all.

This scandal is a staggering indictment of higher education, and American education policy generally. Virtually every constituency in American life has good reason to be rankled. Defenders of affirmative action for various minority groups are rightly livid about this effort, by mostly rich white people who already have every advantage imaginable, to game the system. Opponents of affirmative action who argue that merit alone should determine admissions have every reason to be outraged as well.

For both groups, and for everyone between the two extremes, the pressure to get kids into the best college possible -- and then figure out how to pay for it -- is a source of incredible anxiety.

But the scandal goes beyond just these issues. It is also a searing indictment of the value of an elite college education in the first place (and the ridiculous emphasis schools place on collegiate sports). None of these parents seemed remotely concerned about whether their kids could hack it once they got into their dream schools -- and rightly so.

George Mason economics professor Bryan Caplan, in his book The Case Against Education, makes a compelling case that most of the value in diplomas from elite colleges isn't in the education they allegedly represent but in the cultural or social ""signaling"" they convey.

Imagine you're deposited on a desert island, forced to fend for yourself. Would you rather have the knowledge that comes with taking a survival-training course, or just the piece of paper that says you took the course? Obviously, you'd rather know how to identify poisonous plants and sources of water than have a diploma that says you know how to do things you can't do. Now, ask yourself: Would you rather have the Yale education without the diploma, or the diploma without the education?

From an economic perspective, the piece of paper is vastly more valuable than the education, particularly in the humanities (and Caplan runs through the numbers to demonstrate this). The paper opens doors and gets you callbacks from employers and entr√©e into elite social circles where whom you know matters more than what you know. The education might make you a better person, but the parchment is the ticket to opportunity. It's no guarantee of success, but it's a profound hedge against failure.

Parents know this, and parents without special advantages -- wealth, fame, connections -- resent it.

As a matter of public policy, the way we tell everyone they should go to college, even if it means incurring crushing debt, is a scandal. College isn't for everyone, and it isn't necessary for many careers or vocations -- and shouldn't be necessary for many others.

If there's a maxim that should serve as a golden rule for policymakers, it's this: Complexity is a subsidy. The more complex we make a system, the more it rewards people with the resources -- social, cognitive, political, or financial -- to navigate it. A system that rewards subjective priorities -- in the name of diversity, athletics, social justice, donations, preferences for legacy students, whatever -- creates opportunities for bureaucrats, parents, and students to game the system.

You're never going to create a system where some parents won't do anything and everything to help their kids. All you can do is create a system that makes it more difficult to cheat or exploit loopholes. That requires clear, simple rules applicable to everyone.",308,nationalreview.com,College Admissions Bribery a Scandal for Our Populist Moment
"'TERROR ATTACK' LEAVES AT LEAST 49 DEAD IN NEW ZEALAND: One person has been charged in connection with a ""well-planned"" terrorist attack that killed 49 people and injured dozens more in two mosques in New Zealand on Friday, authorities said ... The New Zealand police said four people -- three men and one woman -- were in custody in connection with the attack. Investigators later defused a number of improvised explosive devices that were found inside vehicles. Prime Minister Jacinda Arden described the suspects as one principal, two associates and one person not directly connected to the attacks. She said the suspects were not on any security watch lists. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that one of the detainees was a 28-year-old white Australian-born citizen. He described the suspect as ""an extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist.""

No motive has been determined. However, a man who claimed responsibility for the shootings described anti-immigrant views in a manifesto. Investigators did not rule out that more suspects could be involved. Police were also working to remove an unconfirmed video that circulated online showing a suspect entering a building and firing multiple shots at people inside.

TRUMP VETO LOOMS: President Trump is expected to issue his first-ever veto on Friday after Senate Democrats, joined by 12 Republicans, voted to block his declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border ... The president made his intentions crystal clear, tweeting ""VETO!"" moments after the resolution against the plan passed Thursday. The vote was 59-41, despite White House efforts to keep the GOP united on the issue of border security.

CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT FILED IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: The University of Southern California, Yale and several other elite colleges are being sued by multiple students and graduates who claim they were denied a fair opportunity for admission and have had their degrees devalued due to a college cheating scheme detailed by federal officials Tuesday ... The University of San Diego, the University of Texas at Austin, Wake Forest, Georgetown, Stanford, Yale and USC -- along with William ""Rick"" Singer, who was called the ringleader of the admissions scheme -- were also named as defendants. The plaintiffs claim they weren't given a fair opportunity to be accepted into the elite colleges where they'd applied because some people were allegedly admitted based on fake athletic profiles and distorted SAT and ACT scores obtained through bribes. Meanwhile, in wake of the charges she faces in the college admissions scandal, actress Lori Loughlin was dropped by the Hallmark Channel, a representative confirmed to Fox News on Thursday.

MIXED REACTION FOR BETO 2020: Though he initially said he wasn't going to make a presidential run, former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke reversed that decision, announcing his candidacy in the wee hours of Thursday morning ... The excitement among some of his supporters was palpable in the Democrat's hometown, El Paso, Texas. Though some say O'Rourke's candidacy raises excitement among Texans, politics professor Todd Curry, from the University of Texas at El Paso, is wary of notions that the candidate could flip this red state. ""I still think we have to wait a few more election cycles until Texas is put into play,"" said Curry. O'Rourke is set to hold a kickoff rally in El Paso on March 30.

MORE PROOF OF CLINTON FAVORITISM AT OBAMA'S DOJ? - The Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Hillary Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok testified during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer ... According to a newly released transcript, Strzok acknowledged that Clinton's private personal email servers contained a mixture of emails related to the Clinton Foundation, her work as secretary of state and other matters. Republicans late last year renewed their efforts to probe the Clinton Foundation, after tax documents showed a plunge in its incoming donations after Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign. The numbers fueled longstanding allegations of possible ""pay-to-play"" transactions at the organization.

ISRAEL STRIKES BACK AFTER TEL AVIV ATTACK: The Israeli military early Friday announced it had launched airstrikes on ""terror sites in Gaza,"" a retaliatory move after rockets blamed on the militant group Hamas were fired on Tel Aviv ... The strikes occurred in Khan Younis, roughly 15 miles south of Gaza City, according to the Associated Press. There were no immediate reports of injuries. A Hamas naval base was targeted, the outlet reported, citing Palestinian media.

"The worst part always comes when there are no more games left with which to argue for your inclusion in the Field of 68, and when there is still plenty of time left for minds to be changed and metrics to be studied, for other results from all across the country to give you acid indigestion.

There are no more games left for St. John's, and if what we saw Thursday night is the kind of testimony the Red Storm were going to provide, perhaps that is for the best. The Johnnies beat Marquette twice this year, and it's those two wins (plus the feel-good Garden victory over Villanova that feels like it happened during the first Bush Administration) that are the keystones of their case to make the NCAA Tournament.

It's a good thing both of those games were televised, because after the way they played Thursday night -- the way they've played most of the last month, truth be told -- it's good to have evidence to prove there was a time when the Johnnies could channel the better angels of their split basketball personality for more than two possessions at a time.

""We struggled all night,"" Chris Mullin said, surveying the detritus of an 86-54 slaughter at the hands of the Golden Eagles, and it was more than they struggled -- they looked tired. We will say it was ""tired"" because the only other word to use would be ""disinterested"" -- and we wouldn't want to believe that with the NCAA's eagle eyes watching everything that happens these next 72 hours, they would possibly be as carefree as they looked.

All of the prognosticators with their formulas and their numbers and their steadfast belief in forecasting what the Selection Committee will do still insist the Johnnies are in the tournament, almost all of the credible ones going a step further and declaring they are safe from taking a two-day detour though Dayton to play a preliminary-round game.

Typical of these is ESPN's Joe Lunardi, whose bracket prediction following the Johnnies' outbracket-game defeat of woebegone DePaul had them safely in as an 11 seed in the South bracket (with an opening-game matchup against Mississippi State, in Des Moines). Lunardi isn't always perfect, but he has an awfully good track record, and it has been his steadfast belief in St. John's that has helped nourish its most fervent fans.

And even his brackets are fluid. So far St. John's has survived the bid-stealing thievery of Saint Mary's, which had the audacity to knock off Gonzaga. Could they survive if, say, West Virginia builds on its stunning win over Texas Tech in the Big 12 and runs the table in Kansas City? What if someone across town in the A-10s -- let's pick a totally random team, like St. Bonaventure -- has a good weekend in Brooklyn?

Such are the things that await St. John's fans the next few days. The folks who actually work for and play at St. John's don't seem all that worried, truth be told. Asked to do what just about all coaches do at this time of the year and make a public case for his team, Mullin declined.

""I'll be watching Sunday [when the Selection Show airs on CBS],"" he said. ""I'm not really here to make a case. If I needed a lawyer -- we do what we did, and we'll see what happens Sunday. No politicking. I stay out of politics.""

Pressed further if he'll pay attention to other relevant games or simply push everything out of the team's mind until Sunday, Mullin said: ""I told my guys to take a break. They need a break mentally, physically, maybe need a little break from each other, and we'll be back together Sunday, have a good practice, then probably watch the Selection Show and see what's what.""

If only you, as a fan, could be so cool, right? Instead, the hard part is just beginning. And so is the longest 72 hours of the college basketball season.",310,New York Post,Now St. John's fans must sit and await NCAA Tournament fate

"David Remnick accepts an award on stage at the Ellie Awards 2019. Getty Images for ASME

It was a battle of the titans at the National Magazine Awards Thursday night, pitting Adam Moss, in his final contest at the helm of New York magazine, against David Remnick of The New Yorker, the once and future champion.

Heading into this year's contest Moss had won 40 Ellies in his 15-year tenure, while Remnick took home 44 trophies over the course of 20 years at the helm.

In the final showdown, it was Remnick by a technical knockout, with the judges from the American Society of Magazine Editors awarding him four new Ellies.

Moss, 61, added only one more Golden Elephant, as the statues are also known, for leisure interests for the story ""How To Be an Artist"" by Jerry Saltz, boosting his career total to 41. He was also inducted into the Magazine Editors Hall of Fame in a moving tribute.

Remnick's haul means that The New Yorker has won 48 times since he took the helm in 1998.

The awards were moderated by CNN's John Avlon, a former chief editor of the Daily Beast, and held at the East Williamsburg music venue Brooklyn Steel, marking the first time in the 54-year history of the prestigious honors that they were held outside Manhattan.

The highlight of the night was the standing ovation that was given to Moss upon his induction into the magazine editors Hall of Fame.

""Reporting, writing, photography and design, the 67 magazines and Web sites we honored tonight do it all,"" said ASME CEO Sid Holt.

""But what made the occasion especially significant -- and especially touching for many readers and journalists who have been influenced by his work -- was the presentation of ASME's Hall of Fame Award to one of the most thoughtful and innovative editors of our time, Adam Moss,"" Holt said as he introduced Moss.

A humbled Moss quipped, ""Thirty-five years of work reduced to a 150-second video.

""This organization has been very good to me for a long time. The first time I stood on an Ellie stage, Dan Quayle was still vice president of the United States, they

were still making episodes of 'Golden Girls.'

""And the event was at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan.

""I really am ancient. I really want to express my gratitude to you for all the kindness you have shown me over the years,"" Moss said.

""But here's the thing. Every bit of the work you saw on the screen was done by somebody -- editors, photographers, writers,"" he added.

""An editor's job is really to trick other people to do all the work. I am really a grateful and lucky guy,"" Moss said, before he thanked Pam Wasserstein -- New York Media CEO -- for ""letting me be a part of a great family business ... but I regard all magazines as a family business.""

Only two magazines won more than one Ellie this year.

Topic won two awards in the video category, one for service and lifestyle and the other for news and opinion. Also, the New York Times Magazine took home two, including one for digital innovation and another for essays and criticism.

ASME judges also handed out general excellence Ellies in four categories.

In the highly competitive news, sports and entertainment category, National Geographic won its eighth Ellie, besting The Marshall Project, New York, Time and Wired.

T: The New York Times Style Magazine won general excellence in the service and lifestyle category for the second year in a row.

The other two general excellence awards went to upstart titles: Kazoo, which won for special interests, and Virginia Quarterly, which won its second general excellence in the literature, science and politics category.

Bill Keller, a one-time top editor at the New York Times, said in November he is stepping down from his latest gig atop the not-for-profit The Marshall Project, but was in Brooklyn to accept the award for best Web site in the news and opinion category. Keller said he will stay on until a replacement is found.

Popular Science won best single topic issue for one entitled ""The Tiny Issue,"" while Personal Service was taken by 5280 magazine in something of an upset with ""The Art of Dying Well,"" beating out Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Outside and Women's Health.

In other awards, Wired won for design and photography.

GQ Style won for service and lifestyle.

Roads & Kingdoms, the travel journalist Web site, was honored for service and lifestyle, although nobody was present to accept. Master of Ceremonies Avlon said he would accept the Ellie on behalf of the late Anthony Bourdain, who was a co-founder.

Bon Appetit won for Social Media.

""It's cool to know that someone from El Paso, a town like ours, can strive to do something that incredible,"" designer Patrick Gabaldon said of Beto O'Rourke's decision to enter the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates.

Gabaldon first created the images when O'Rourke was running for the Senate seat against incumbent Ted Cruz last year, a race that propelled O'Rourke into the national spotlight.

While he ultimately lost that midterm election to Cruz by a few percentage points, O'Rourke gained name recognition and became known for his fundraising prowess, raising an eye-popping $80 million during his run.

Though he initially said he wasn't going to make a presidential run, O'Rourke reversed that decision, announcing in the wee hours of Thursday morning.

""Amy and I are happy to share with you that I'm running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America,"" he said in a video.

By noon, several people had requested the shirts. Excitement among El Pasoans was growing.

WHO'S STILL ON THE FENCE FOR 2020? AFTER BETO, THESE DEMS COULD JUMP IN NEXT

""I think he's going to be a good run. I think he'll do much better [than] our current president. And, I'm just a Democratic person. So he has my vote,"" said Alan Zambrano.

O'Rourke was in Iowa for the first few stops along his campaign trail. He visited Keokuk, Fort Madison, Burlington, and Muscatine, rallying voters and sharing his views for the country.

He called for guaranteed, high-quality health care and action on climate change.

""This is our final chance, the scientists are absolutely unanimous on this, that we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis,"" said O'Rourke.

Still, some are less than enthused about his run.

""I am not in support of him as a candidate. I believe that the Democrats have to sort out what they're going to do. I believe that President Trump will continue as the president, and I wish Beto the best of luck,"" said Steven Nagy.

Others say they have little faith in the political system at all.

""I'm disillusioned with the representation of the people. I feel that our political leaders are more representing the big business and money than the individuals themselves throughout the U.S,"" said Tafari Nugent.

Though some say O'Rourke's candidacy raises excitement among Texans, politics professor Todd Curry, from the University of Texas at El Paso, is wary of notions that the candidate could flip this red state.

""I still think we have to wait a few more election cycles until Texas is put into play,"" said Curry.

"Andrew Cuomo for president?! Four more years as governor?!

Gov. Cuomo held a swanky, hush-hush fundraiser at the posh St. Regis hotel in midtown Thursday night -- while in the midst of negotiations with state lawmakers to adopt a $173 billion budget by April 1.

And wouldn't you know? Donors with business before Albany were among those who attended the big bucks event.

Cuomo, who was just overwhelmingly re-elected to a third, four-year term in November, was seen walking into the St. Regis about 6:30 p.m.

Among those seen at the bash was Kennth Raske, head of the New York Greater Hospital Association, whose organization is fighting to block any reduction in Medicaid funding to medical facilities.

Raske got up and praised the governor for his work on health care, an insider said.

There were also reps from the cannabis industry there as Cuomo and lawmakers discuss whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.

Other attendees included reps from the Cable TV industry, the limousine association and financial services -- all licensed and regulated by the state.

And there were labor leaders present, including Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest union representing state government workers.

The campaign soiree, where filet mignon and braised beef was served, raised eyebrows among government watchdog groups pushing for new laws to curb massive campaign contributions from special interests and pay-to-play politics.

""Ideally there shouldn't be fundraisers during budget negotiations or during the time the Legislature is in session,"" said Susan Lerner, director of NY Common Cause.

During his speech, Cuomo railed against the opposition that caused Amazon to cancel its plan to open new headquarters on the Queens waterfront. He called the resistance ""the stupidest thing I've ever seen.""

He also discussed the importance of coming up with financing to fund the MTA.

He bashed President Trump's spending plan and the new federal law that caps at $10,000 the amount of state and local tax taxes that New Yorkers can deduct on their federal tax returns.

But Team Cuomo treated the event as a dirty secret. It wasn't mentioned on his schedule nor was it posted on his campaign website.

"The writer's grandfather traded in martyr complexes and despair to become a proud American.

My grandfather was a reluctant Irishman. Depending on your opinions of writers like James Joyce or F. Scott Fitzgerald, that puts him in good company. The Irish are known for many things: a deeply pious brand of Catholicism, an abiding love of alcohol, stubbornly curly/wavy hair, an even more stubborn (and melancholic) disposition, and adroit skills with spoken word, prose, and verse. My grandfather -- a fourth-generation American -- had all these traits in spades, as well as a good Irish name to boot: John Benedict Fitzpatrick, though he preferred ""Jack."" Yet Jack was profoundly conflicted about his Irish heritage -- indeed, even a little ashamed of it -- in a manner that seemed strange, especially in a post-Kennedy era when being Irish (and Catholic) was becoming synonymous with being a ""full-blooded American."" Over the years, however, I've come to respect my grandfather's ambivalence about his Irishness, as well as his unparalleled pride in being American.

Born in 1920s Queens, Jack grew up in a largely homogenous Irish-American neighborhood. He attended both parochial and public schools (PS 109 in Brooklyn) until his parents' Depression-era poverty led him to drop out at age 14 and find a job to support the family. He delivered watches across New York City and once encountered the great Babe Ruth in an elevator -- he had ""some dame"" on his arm and was smoking a fat cigar, my grandfather recounted to me. When the Second World War began, Jack promptly signed up with the Coast Guard, and spent most of the war in Norfolk, Virginia, where he fell in love not only with the Old Dominion, but with another fourth-generation Irish American, my grandmother. After the war, they married and started a family, and he began working in the dental supply business. Eventually he founded his own successful company in Springfield, Virginia. He sold it in the 1980s for enough money to retire on. God bless America.

With a ""rags to riches"" story like that, one similar to millions of Irish-Catholic Americans who moved from poverty or near-poverty to success and stability, why would my grandfather be so conflicted about his Irish heritage? In part, I think, precisely because this is a uniquely American story. My grandfather viewed himself as in some respects overcoming the weaknesses and struggles of Irish culture and identity. The more that he identified with being first an American, the less he felt the need to stress his Irish heritage, even if it was indelibly bound to him.

The Irish proclivity towards self-pity and defeatism was one trait my grandfather eschewed. Jack found frustrating such descriptions as the one famously offered by William Butler Yeats: ""Being Irish, he had an abiding sense of tragedy, which sustained him through temporary periods of joy."" Of course, the Irish have plenty of legitimate tragedy to mourn: Oliver Cromwell's brutal conquest of Ireland reduced the island's population by at least 15 percent; the Great Famine (and British negligence in addressing it) resulted in a million deaths and another million emigrants; WASP-dominated America discriminated against the Irish and their Catholic faith for centuries. Yet some Irish, rather than seeking to overcome this sorrowful history, wallowed in martyr complexes and depression. There's a reason so many films about the Emerald Isle are unbearably melancholic. Jack understood the imperative of remembering this tortured story, and indeed had his own, having grown up in poverty and witnessed quintessentially Irish despair and alcoholism in his family. But he didn't want it to define his life. His was an era where any intelligent, enterprising man could transcend humble origins and make his mark, and he aimed to achieve as much as he could -- professionally, intellectually, and artistically. So he did.

Jack was also ambivalent about Irish culture, especially as a niche market developed in America around all things Gaelic. He found especially silly those Irish Americans obnoxiously prideful of their ancestral country's literature, cuisine, or music. All of these things had their merits, he would acknowledge -- J.M. Synge, Jameson, and the Chieftains are all worthy of adulation. But let's be honest -- the best Irish writers represent only a small chunk of the West's best literary tradition. Irish food and drink can be plenty hearty and tasty but are dwarfed by other cultures' culinary contributions. And Irish music gets pretty annoying the day after St. Patrick's Day. As one who loves Joyce, bangers and mash, and the bodhran, I'm grateful that my grandfather's skepticism towards Irish culture was somewhat blunted when he read Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization, which reminded him of the Gael's significant contributions to the West. Moreover, the Irish contribution to global Christianity cannot be easily overstated. For such a small land, the Emerald Isle has certainly punched above its weight. Yet when one ranks Irish civilization among others in the Western tradition (e.g. French, Italian, German, and even, yes, I daresay, English), a little cynicism towards Irish pride is appropriate.

Such skepticism is especially relevant when considering Irish Americans who have placed allegiance to their ancestral land over their adoptive American home. Some foolishly supported the Irish Republican Army (IRA) after Irish independence. Others promoted organizations that served as agents of the IRA. My grandfather would have none of this. He had sympathy for the suffering of Irish Catholics during ""The Troubles,"" but he had no interest in supporting terrorists or pushing for U.S. intervention, be it Ireland or anywhere else. Indeed, unlike many internationalist Irish-American politicians, he was an adamant isolationist who believed America should well honor John Quincy Adams' warning to not go abroad ""in search of monsters to destroy."" (He would be quite proud to know I write for a magazine founded by Pat Buchanan!) As far as Jack was concerned, once someone became an American, his first allegiance must be to America and its interests.

This is perhaps the most salient lesson I learned from my grandfather. Though he could never escape his Irish heritage -- exemplified, among other things, by his wit, his temper, and his tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church -- he, as an American, placed his Gaelic blood in the background of his identity. Even the idea of being called an ""Irish American,"" struck him as odd. If we allow these ethnic or racial monikers to obscure a fully American identity, we keep the most important, if ambitious, goals of the American experiment at arm's length. We risk segregating ourselves into tribes that fuel the dead ends of identity politics, exemplified in such events as the egregiously unprofessional, erroneous coverage of the Covington Catholic scandal.

To have pride in one's heritage is one thing. To make it the preeminent marker of one's identity -- or worse, a political weapon to demonize one's opponents -- undermines the demands of a patriotism for all peoples. Thus this Saint Paddy's, I will remember and honor my grandfather and his indelible Irish character. I will gladly toast him and my fellow Fenians with a Guinness. Yet I will also remember that the best memorial for Jack Benedict Fitzpatrick is to be a man defined by virtue, faith, and patriotism. Those are traits any American, Irish or not, should aspire to.",315,The American Conservative,Remembering a Reluctant Irishman
"""We can't be divided by race, religion, by tribe. We're defined by those enduring principles in the Constitution, even though we don't necessarily all know them.""

So Joe Biden told the firefighters union this week.

But does Joe really believe that? Or does that not sound more like a plea, a wistful hope, rather than a deep conviction?

For Biden surely had in mind the debate that exploded last week in the House Democratic caucus on how to punish Somali-American and Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar for raising the specter of dual loyalty.

Rebutting accusations of anti-Semitism, Omar had fired back: ""I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK to push for allegiance to a foreign country.""

Omar was talking about Israel.

Republicans raged that Nancy Pelosi's caucus must denounce Omar for anti-Semitism. Journalists described the raising of the ""dual loyalty"" charge as a unique and awful moment, perhaps a harbinger of things to come.

Yet allegations of dual loyalty against ethnic groups, even from statesmen, have a long history in American politics.

In 1915, President Theodore Roosevelt, at a convention of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, bellowed: ""There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism...German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans, or Italian-Americans. There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is a man who is an American and nothing else.""

The New York Times headline the next morning: ""Roosevelt Bars the Hyphenated."" It continued: ""No Room in This Country for Dual Nationality, He Tells Knights of Columbus. Treason to Vote as Such.""

What would Roosevelt think of the dual citizenship of many Americans today? If someone is a citizen of more than one country, how do we know where his primary allegiance lies?

Does not dual citizenship, de facto, imply dual loyalty?

Nor was the Rough Rider alone in his alarm. As America edged toward intervention in the European war, President Woodrow Wilson, too, tore into ""the hyphenates"":

The passions and intrigues of certain active groups and combinations of men amongst us who were born under foreign flags injected the poison of disloyalty into our most critical affairs. ...

I am the candidate of a party, but I am above all things else, an American citizen. I neither seek the favor nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element amongst us which puts loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the United States.

In another address, Wilson declared:

There is disloyalty active in the United States, and it must be absolutely crushed. It proceeds from...a very small minority, but a very active and subtle minority. It works underground but it shows its ugly head where we can see it, and there are those at this moment who are trying to levy a species of political blackmail, saying: ""Do what we wish in the interest of foreign sentiment or we will wreak our vengeance at the polls.""

What did Ilhan Omar say to compare with that?

Roosevelt and Wilson had in mind some German and Irish citizens whose affections for the lands and peoples whence they came made them adversaries of Wilson's war, into which we would soon be dragged by a WASP elite with deep ties to Great Britain.

Our Founding Fathers, too, were ever alert to the dangers of dual loyalty. In his Farewell Address, President Washington warned against a ""passionate attachment"" to any foreign nation that might create the illusion of some ""common interest...where no common interest exists.""

Did FDR fear dual loyalty? His internment of 110,000 Japanese, mostly U.S. citizens, for the duration of World War II suggests that he did.

Did not the prosecution of American communists under the Smith Act, begun by Truman and continued by Eisenhower, suggest that these first postwar presidents saw peril in a secret party that gave allegiance to a hostile foreign power?

Where Wilson, TR, and FDR distrusted ethnic and racial minorities, Truman went after the ideological enemies within -- the communists.

What defines us, said Joe Biden, are the ""enduring principles in the Constitution, even though we don't necessarily all know them.""

But if these principles, of which many Americans are not even aware, says Joe, are what define us and hold us together, then what is it that is tearing us apart?

Is it not our differences? Is it not our diversity?

Is it not the powerful and conflicting claims of a multiplicity of races, religions, tribes, ethnicities, and nationalities, as well as clashing ideologies, irreconcilable moral codes, a culture war, and conflicting visions of America's past -- the one side seeing it as horrible and hateful, the other as great and good?

""Diversity is our greatest strength!"" we are ever admonished.

But where is the evidence for what appears to be not only an inherently implausible claim but a transparently foolish and false one?

"BANGKOK - You could call it the 7 million-voter question: Will young people like the ones who turned out on a recent Saturday night to listen to politically hip rappers also make it to the polls for Thailand's upcoming general election? And do they share the anger at the established order being sung and shouted about onstage?

The country in which this year's 7 million eligible first-time voters have grown up has experienced two army coups since 2006, violent political polarization and a nasty crackdown on freedom of expression by the military clique that has held the reins since a 2014 takeover.

Topping the recent concert bill was the group Rap Against Dictatorship, whose surprise hit, ""My Country's Got That,"" lambasts the hypocrisy of Thai society. Some of the song's milder lyrics describe Thailand as ""the country whose Parliament is a parlor.""

The breakthrough song has garnered almost 59 million views since its release on YouTube last October. Judging by the crowd at the concert, most of its fans hail from the 18-to-35-year-old demographic that makes up roughly a quarter of Thailand's 51 million-strong electorate.

This generation is too young to hold many memories of a Thailand that was not politically troubled.

If it is unsympathetic to army rule, it also does not harbor any nostalgic affection for former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire populist whose 2006 overthrow ushered in a political dark age in what had been one of Southeast Asia's most promising democracies.

Unlike Thaksin's hardcore ""red shirt"" followers and his rabid ""yellow shirt"" opponents -- groups whose violent street protests helped derail electoral politics -- their allegiances are up for grabs.

Political parties are taking notice, mostly by showcasing their younger candidates.

The Democrat Party, the country's oldest, has its ""New Dem"" group of 21 young politicians led by 26-year-old Parit Wacharasindhu, a nephew of party leader Abhisit Vejajjiva, a former prime minister who himself once capitalized on his youthful image. Another of its members is Surabot Leekpai, the 30-year-old son of another former Democrat prime minister, Chuan Leekpai.

Another group, Bhumjaithai, previously known as an old-fashioned patronage-driven regional party, has been rebranding with campaign posters hitting hot-button issues close to urban millennials' hearts -- liberalization of marijuana laws, clear legalization of ride-sharing services and the easing of repayment terms for student loans.

Even the Palang Prachatrath Party, more or less a proxy for the military that supports returning the current army-installed prime minister to office, showed off 30 young members at a news conference, many contesting parliamentary seats in the capital, Bangkok.

But it's the Future Forward Party, founded last March, that seems to have captured the imagination of many young voters.

Party chief Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who can tap into a family fortune from the auto parts industry, projects an image similar to a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Tall and trim, and favoring casual dress, the 40-year-old is tech-savvy and practices extreme sports. He also has a low-profile history of supporting progressive organizations, while most of his core team is younger and directly involved in activist groups promoting causes such as rights for the disabled, the LGBT community and the #MeToo movement.

""My idea is to make this party stand for democratic principles,"" Thanathorn said at the party's debut last year. ""We will make democracy a part of every decision-making process from the choosing of party members, the determining of party direction and strategy, to the developing of party policies.""

The party's broad-stroke policies are a response to Thailand's political impasse: radically reforming the coup-inclined military and rewriting the military-imposed constitution to restore democracy.

""I think the conflict over the last 12 years has educated the people that politics is important to their lives,"" Thanathorn said in an interview at a campaign event at Siam University in Bangkok. ""Political awareness in this country has never been higher.""

Boonyanuch Prachasingh, a 20-year-old student at the university, said she is looking for a party with strong policies on education, democratization and transparency, and capable of change. She said Future Forward sounds interesting ""because they are making a point of encouraging us to pay attention to politics.""

A fellow student, 21-year-old Kittiphum Pannadermitri, believes the economy is the most pressing issue.

""I think Thanathorn is from a new generation and has new ideas. I think he could help improve the economy, help Thai farmers, and tackle pollution problems,"" he said.

Concertgoer Sawitree Puangngern, 23, said interest in the election is high among her peers, and she has already decided to vote for Future Forward.

""I am interested in the party that says they want change,"" she said. ""I want the military out from politics and I want people to have their rights back.""

Although Future Forward is hoping it can pick up as many as 50 to 70 parliamentary seats, it faces substantial hurdles as a newly established grass-roots party facing experienced opponents.

It also has drawn scurrilous attacks online from conservative elements of Thai society, who paint Thanathorn as a stalking horse for Thaksin because he espouses progressive policies that also are supported by Thaksin's supporters. That his uncle was a top member of Thaksin's party and served in one of his Cabinets heightens their suspicions.

Still, the party's prospects for capturing the youth vote look good, said Prajak Kongkirati, a lecturer in political science at Bangkok's Thammasat University.

""They are popular and their policies are popular,"" he said. ""They advocate change and radical reforms. So the youth who are frustrated with the stagnation of the country, they want to see a real change. And Thanathorn is kind of their hope, represents something new, speaks their own language and can connect to the youth.""

"Is controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar threatening Democratic unity?

It is the rare Republican today who hasn't been called a racist or a bigot, particularly if he or she is running for office. From candidates for city council to presidential hopefuls, Republicans across the nation are perpetually put on the defensive, as if they have to prove that they're not racists.

This has been the real goal of Democrats, and it has worked like a charm. But in reality, the left is guilty of precisely the same sins they falsely accuse Republicans of perpetrating.

As a proud American Jew, I don't look for anti-Semitism around every corner. But I didn't have to look hard to see it in the ongoing and egregious case of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. Her overt Jew hatred keeps slapping me in the face.

IN FAILING TO CONDEMN REP. ILHAN OMAR, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS TOLERATING ITSELF TO DEATH

At first, the Democratic Party just ignored Omar's blatant bigotry. Then, Democrats twisted themselves into pretzels to avoid naming her in their feckless resolution, which eventually sounded like all of their other clich√©s. Did they hope we wouldn't notice that she was the reason for the resolution in the first place?

The left has worked so hard at its agenda of identity politics, and has stereotyped everyone according to various groupings, that when it's time to admonish one person in a specific case, the leftists fear the very behavior that they themselves planted - that everyone belonging to that group will revolt as the ""victims"" they've been taught to be.

When I was a kid, my dear father made a point to remind me how fortunate I was to be an American, because socialism and anti-Semitism (which historically have gone hand-in-hand) would never happen here. Were he alive today, it saddens me to know how heartbroken he'd be to see those evils proliferating in our modern politics.

Overt bigotry and anti-Semitism have been festering in the Democratic Party for a long time. They escalated at about the same time the left endeavored to expand the definition of racism itself. Over time, things like black holes, hoop earrings and Dr. Seuss became racist.

The ease with which the left hurls accusations of racism would be highly entertaining, were it not for the underlying hunger for power. To the new American left, words themselves are racist regardless of the context of their use or the users themselves. That takes collectivism to a whole new and frightening level.

In a surprisingly short amount of time, leftists have succeeded in getting about half the country to believe that a formerly well-respected businessman and pop culture figure who became president against all odds is a racist. They have gone the extra mile by branding his voters racist, too.

With such an obsession for this subject, you would think leftists could recognize and condemn actual bigotry when they see it. But they can't. And that's why we know that their faux accusations have been nothing more than a highly effective political tactic.

This is a good time to remind ourselves of the actual definition of bigotry: a stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief or opinion that differs from one's own.

By that common-sense definition, Ilhan Omar is a bigot. So, too, is leftism itself, which has exactly that level of intolerance for groups that oppose its socialist ideology: Conservatives, straight men, Christians, Second Amendment supporters, opponents of illegal immigration, those who love free markets -- or who just love America, period.

Current House Democrats failed to condemn a clear case of bigotry, but they will still expect us to listen to their lectures about bigotry and racism. No one should fall prey to this ploy ever again.

Omar's case should demonstrate once and for all the lack of credibility behind the left's endless accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc.

"Is Beto O'Rourke pandering or is his message lost in translation?

Hours after O'Rourke announced he would run for president, the former Democratic congressman's website became a focal point for many of his critics. In particular, some pointed out perceived differences between his English and Spanish websites.

The English version has the slogan ""Beto for America."" while the Spanish version reads, ""Beto para todos,"" which translates to ""Beto for all.""

""Like he did at his rally, Beto once again standing with non-citizens over Americans,"" Campus Reform senior correspondent Eduardo Neret tweeted about the website differences.

Business Insider politics reporter John Haltiwanger tweeted that ""'Beto para los Estados Unidos' would be way too long.""

O'Rourke narrowly lost a senate campaign to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2018.

Conservative critics are also going after O'Rourke for his website not having any information on his policies but promoting their merchandise store.

"This weekend, Mayor de Blasio will travel to New Hampshire, the latest stop on his presidential-flirtation tour. Last month, he took a similar swing through Iowa, another presidential-primary state, to test the waters of ¬≠national politics.

Someone should remind him that a prerequisite of any run for higher office is, usually, success in your current job.

It's becoming abundantly clear that, after five years of the de Blasio administration's progressive policies, the city is in trouble.

A clear sign emerged last week, when local teachers-union boss (and de Blasio ally) Michael Mulgrew admitted: ""Our current discipline system is broken"" and ""doesn't work for students or staff."" Mulgrew was referring to the de Blasio administration's ""warning-card"" system and therapeutic approach to discipline, which in practice mean that students can smoke pot, threaten classmates and disrespect teachers with no real consequences.

Mulgrew is only the latest in a broad array of municipal union leaders who have stepped up to criticize the policies of a mayor with a special knack of demoralizing city workers while putting their safety and that of the general public at risk.

Whether they work at the NYPD, the Department of Correction, the Department of Homeless Services, and whether they are school-safety officers or employees of the Department of Education, the complaints of rank-and-file workers are much the same: Progressive policies aren't working, and we are quickly returning to the bad old days.

In addition, over the past few weeks, New Yorkers have seen crystal clear examples of the de Blasio administration's ill-conceived belief that, if you throw huge amounts of money at a problem, it might go away.

First, we learned that the DOE was closing down the unsuccessful and scandal-ridden Renewal Schools program after spending $773 million on it. That was closely followed by Comptroller Scott Stringer's after-the-fact alert that First Lady Chirlane McCray's pet mental-health project, Thrive NYC, had blown through $850 million without much to show for it. It's a point that I and many other serious mental-health advocates have been making for a long time.

But it doesn't end there. The proposed fiscal year 2020 city budget of $92.2 billion has raised eyebrows with nearly $3 billion in increased spending. This, despite a growing long-term debt that's more than $81,000 per household and despite experts' warning that the city is on the brink of bankruptcy, should a setback occur.

The city is already ranked number one when it comes to highest local-tax burden, and homeowners have seen the property-tax levy skyrocket 44 percent since de Blasio took office.

And what are New Yorkers getting for the high cost of living? Certainly not results.

Our homeless population has grown to 76,000, despite a record level of spending. The staggering annual cost per prisoner spent by the Department of Correction on those residing in our city's jails has jumped to $300,000. Our subways are a disaster. Our streets are in disrepair. Health + Hospitals keeps hemorrhaging money. And then there's NYCHA, where a tenant population slightly larger than the city of Cleveland is treated with malign ¬≠bureaucratic neglect.

Rents are too damn high. There are empty storefronts everywhere. The middle class is shrinking. Sex crimes are on the rise. And no one who visits the city can ignore the public urination, the litter, the addicts openly injecting at needle-strewn parks and other sights and sounds reminiscent of the 1970s.

All these problems bring me around to one very simple question: What does Bill de Blasio say to the Democratic voters of South Carolina, Iowa or New Hampshire when they ask, ""How are things going back home in New York?""",321,New York Post,Why de Blasio's presidential road-show is such a laugh
"Perhaps nothing better captures the utter confusion surrounding Brexit than Thursday's vote by Parliament to try to delay the UK's scheduled March 29 departure from the European Union.

The day before, the House of Commons voted its disapproval of a ""hard"" Brexit -- a fast, clean break. Yet it has also twice rejected, by historically overwhelming margins, Prime Minister Theresa May's deal with the EU for something in between.

It also nixed the idea of a new public referendum on whether to leave the EU -- a ""re-vote"" of the question that the public narrowly approved in 2016.

In short, Parliament has no majority for any way forward.

Members plainly don't know what they want. They even rejected (by single vote) a motion to seize control of the Brexit process, which hard-line Brexiteers feared would lead to a softer deal that retains closer ties to Europe than May proposed.

So May will ask for a lengthy (perhaps a year or more) delay from the 27 EU members, which must approve it unanimously, though that now seems likely.

But first, she'll bring her plan up yet again for a vote next week -- giving the hard-liners the unpleasant choice of 1) finally approving her plan or 2) risking an endless series of delays.

As one Conservative MP complained: ""She is holding a pistol to our heads by threatening that we will lose Brexit entirely.""

Meanwhile, the years of muddle have ensured that May's career will end soon, with both major parties still divided internally over all the key issues related to Brexit (and the Labour party further split over its huge anti-Semitism problem).

SENATE VOTES TO BLOCK TRUMP EMERGENCY

NYT: ""The Senate on Thursday easily voted to overturn President Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border, delivering a bipartisan rebuke to what lawmakers in both parties deemed executive overreach by a president determined to build his border wall over Congress's objections. The 59-41 vote on the House-passed measures set up the first veto of Mr. Trump's presidency. It was not overwhelming enough to override Mr. Trump's promised veto, but Congress has now voted to block a presidential emergency declaration for the first time -- and on one of the core promises that animated Mr. Trump's political rise, the vow to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. In an attempt to limit defections ahead of the vote, Mr. Trump had sought to frame the vote publicly as not only a declaration of support for his border security policies but a sign of personal loyalty.""

The twelve Republicans who voted to block Trump - The Hill: ""Here is the list of the GOP senators who voted against Trump on the emergency declaration: Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Sen. Roy Blunt (Mo.), Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), Sen. Mike Lee (Utah), Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.).""

President Donald Trump, in his recent declaration of national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, ordered the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to spend unused but unauthorized money in their budgets on building a 55-mile steel barrier - 'a big, beautiful wall' -- along a portion of that border. Because Congress has expressly and explicitly declined to authorize the funds for the construction of such a barrier, we have a constitutional conflict on our hands."" More here.

'Beto brought vitality to Congress...when he came, he came as a real champion for the environment. He got a great deal of support from the environment community in his district, he won a primary on that subject,' she said. O'Rourke also sat on House Veterans Affairs Committee, which was very important to his district, according to Pelosi. 'In persevering our planet and protecting our people, they're at least two areas in addition to his vitality in so many different ways,' she concluded.""

Is his 2018 performance overrated? - NYT: ""[O'Rourke] did better than every Democrat running statewide in Texas in the 2018 midterms. It seems unlikely that many Democrats would have fared as well as he did, and you could argue it bodes well for his chances in a presidential race. But on balance his success was a reflection of deeper trends. Mr. O'Rourke's close result wasn't because of an exceptional turnout that will be hard for other Democrats to repeat in 2020. Republican voters, defined as those who have participated in a recent Republican primary, turned out at a higher rate than Democratic ones. Neither the Hispanic nor youth voter share of the electorate was higher than it was in 2016, when President Trump won the state by nine points.""

How he could win - FiveThirtyEight: The collective frisson brought on by O'Rourke isn't just superficial, though. The ability to capture a media narrative and to build social media followings is key in America's current politics-as-pop-culture moment. That O'Rourke might be able to command as much attention as, say, President Trump did during the 2016 campaign ain't nothing. And it might well be that his X-factor charm has brought him attention from several high-profile Democrats. Former President Barack Obama met with O'Rourke after the midterms and spoke of him glowingly. 'What I liked most about his race was that it didn't feel constantly poll-tested,' Obama told David Axelrod in a podcast interview.""

2020 hopefuls turn to swing-state Senators for advice - Politico: ""As Democrats prepared to dive into the 2020 presidential election, they have sought counsel from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. But they've also looked to Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan for advice from the key states that tipped the 2016 election to President Donald Trump. The three Midwestern Democratic senators all won reelection in 2018, and they've begun advising 2020 Democrats about how to replicate their success in the heartland next year. In phone calls and informal chats on the Senate floor, they and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) - who last week removed himself from the 2020 race after considering a run - are using their recently tested political clout to influence the primary and steer candidates to their states. ... 'The path to the presidency goes right through Wisconsin. It was Trump's narrow win in this state as well as some neighboring states that solidified the presidency for him,' Baldwin told [Politico] in an interview.""

PENCE CALLS OUT BIDEN

Fox News: ""Vice President Pence, in an exclusive 'Fox & Friends' interview Thursday, said Joe Biden 'caved to liberal activists' when the former vice president backtracked after calling Pence a 'decent guy.' Meanwhile, Biden hinted at a 2020 announcement 'in a few weeks' on Tuesday during a speech at the annual convention of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) union. ... Biden was met with applause and a standing ovation from the audience, but joked: 'Be careful what you wish for. Be careful what you wish for.' Sources familiar with his planning told Fox News last week that top advisers to the former vice president are getting their ducks in a row, figuring out a campaign structure and reaching out to veteran Democratic operatives who would be involved. Those sources suggested a campaign launch come April.""

Can Warren win as a wonk? - AP: ""More than 1,000 people packed a New York concert venue for an act that wasn't on guitar and drums. It was Elizabeth Warren, vocalizing hard numbers. The Massachusetts Democratic senator wove data points into a stump speech that riffed on the policy proposals she's rolled out in her month-old presidential candidacy. 'I love that you want to get into more detail about the 2 percent wealth tax,' she said to a man asking whether her economic plan would drive the wealthy to move overseas. Warren's policy-heavy performance last Friday was a hit with her crowd. And that's something she's counting on heavily in her campaign. She has laid down significant markers in a half-dozen different policy areas since the year began, putting pressure on other 2020 presidential contenders while keeping her campaign in the public eye without having to spend a dollar on ads.""

Harris refunds problematic donations - San Jose Mercury News: ""Sen. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign said Wednesday that it had refunded two donations that violated the senator's pledge not to accept money from lobbyists or agents of foreign governments. Three days after she announced her White House bid in January, Harris received $2,700 from Arthur R. Collins, a lobbyist for the government of Bermuda. Sometime in January or February, Harris also received $2,700 from Vinca LaFleur, a speechwriter for the royal family of Jordan. Both Collins and LaFleur -- who are American -- reported their donations in government filings required of foreign agents. The Harris campaign refunded the money after the Bay Area News Group asked about the contributions this week. The refunds come as the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are jostling to show their bona fides on campaign finance and government reform issues. Many of the top candidates, including Harris, have vowed to reject corporate PAC money, lobbyist donations and support from independent Super PACs.""

Candidates applaud Newsom's move to stop death penalty - Business Insider: ""Two high-profile Democratic presidential candidates are lauding California Governor Gavin Newsom's decision to impose a moratorium on executions in his state. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who's focused heavily on criminal justice reform throughout his political career, in a tweet said, 'Inspired! I applaud @GavinNewsom's decision to impose a moratorium on this immoral and ineffective policy. Because of his leadership and the activism of people across the country, 737 human beings will not be put to death in the name of the people.' Similarly, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who previously served as the state's attorney general, in a tweet referred to capital punishment as 'immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and proven to be unequally applied.'""

AS MUELLER WINDS DOWN, TOP DEPUTY SET TO EXIT

NPR: ""One of the most prominent members of special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating Russia's attack on the 2016 presidential election will soon leave the office and the Justice Department, two sources close to the matter tell NPR. Andrew Weissmann, the architect of the case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, will study and teach at New York University and work on a variety of public service projects, including his longstanding interest in preventing wrongful convictions by shoring up forensic science standards used in courts, the sources added. The departure is the strongest sign yet that Mueller and his team have all but concluded their work. Manafort has been sentenced to about 7 1/2 years in federal prison following two cases that stemmed from Mueller's investigation, although neither case involved alleged collusion with the Russians who interfered in the election. Weissmann has borne the brunt of attacks from critics such as Rush Limbaugh and conservative legal interest groups.""

Overwhelming bipartisan House vote to release Mueller report - NYT: ""House Republicans joined Democrats on Thursday to overwhelmingly demand the Department of Justice release to Congress and the public the full findings of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the possible involvement of President Trump's campaign. Though the resolution is nonbinding and cannot force the Justice Department to take a particular action, Democrats who put it on the House floor are trying to build public pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr in advance of the investigation's anticipated conclusion to share what Robert S. Mueller III produces. Far from standing in the way, Republicans joined Democrats en masse. On the 420-0 vote, four Republicans voted present.""

"More than two dozen wealthy parents -- among them high-powered CEOs and the actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin -- went to expensive and illegal lengths to secure attendance at elite colleges for their own children.

The drastic measures the parents took indicate how much they coveted that symbol of success. But the federal case alleging parents paid to inflate their children's standardized test scores and bribed college coaches to guarantee their kids a spot also reveals the arbitrary nature of that symbol of success.

Though the allegations are illegal and extreme, they aren't the first to illustrate that what it takes to get into many colleges often has little to do with merit.

Research suggests these schools reveal more about where students come from than what they learn while there. That may explain why these parents covet spots at these institutions for their children.

""It's really about the golden ticket of getting in,"" said Antoinette Flores, an associate director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. ""And wealthy students are significantly more likely to do that.""

For many fields, particularly those in science, technology, engineering and math, a degree from an elite college doesn't translate to much higher earnings than a degree from a less-selective school. For students majoring in science-related fields, there's no statistically significant difference in earnings between graduates of elite colleges and those from less-selective schools, according to research from Michael Hilmer, an economist at San Diego State University and Eric Eide and Mark Showalter, economists at Brigham Young University.

But for students who major in business or liberal arts, where you go to school matters -- business majors from top schools make 12 percent more than those from mid-tier schools and 18 percent more than their colleagues from bottom tier schools, for example.

Their study backs up a common refrain from financial aid experts, economists and researchers that in an environment of rising college costs and student debt, what you study may matter more than where you go.

But elite colleges' reputations for offering the golden ticket has meant that parents and policymakers have always questioned elite schools' admissions process. For years, pundits have suggested that top colleges simply use a lottery to form their classes.

On the one hand, affirmative action in college admissions has always been a source of skepticism among conservative groups. The angst around those policies seems particularly ironic to advocates for equity in higher education and students and graduates of color themselves, given the role of wealth in admissions.

How reliable is that golden ticket?

""This situation has exposed what everybody in college admissions has known for a long time,"" said Eva Dodds, an independent college counselor based in the Detroit metro area and affiliated with Collegewise, a college counseling company with offices across the country.

""The expectation that if one gets into one of 150 brand name schools, that equals success, is based on trying to quantify success,"" she added. ""There is no quantitative formula.""

Indeed, many top colleges pride themselves on what they describe as a holistic approach to admissions that takes a variety of factors -- in addition to grades and test scores -- into account.

Some colleges have essentially argued that their admissions process is so complicated and unique that it's essentially proprietary.

As part of a lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants filed last year, the school asked the judge to keep a set of documents describing its admissions practices under seal.

It claimed that the way the school selects its incoming class is tantamount to a trade secret.

(Harvard isn't one of the colleges caught up in the college bribery scandal and in response to claims in the lawsuit the school has said it is ""committed to expanding opportunity to excellence and to creating the diverse community essential to fulfilling its mission"").

The college admissions system is relatively unique in considering factors beyond GPA and test scores, said Anna Ivey, a college consultant and the former dean of admissions at the University of Chicago's law school.

It's difficult to tell if colleges exercise favoritism. ""There's so little transparency from the schools about how that works,"" Ivey said. ""This standard operating procedure was just ripe to be abused.""

Students have control over a finite number of factors. Andy Lockwood, an independent college and financial-aid counselor in Long Island, tells his clients to focus on their grades, test scores and the way they portray themselves in their application.

But even stellar credentials in those categories aren't enough to guarantee a spot. Of the 26,000 domestic applications Harvard received for the 2019 incoming class, 3,500 had a perfect SAT math score, 2,700 had a perfect SAT verbal score, more than 8,000 had a perfect GPA.

If that doesn't sound competitive enough, nearly 1,000 of those 26,000 domestic applications had received perfect composite scores on their standardized tests, according to documents in the lawsuit. They were competing for about 1,600 spots.

College requirements change from year to year

Applicants, however, have no power over who they are competing against and that changes year to year. ""The crafting of a class is a business,"" Dodds said. That may explain why the parents embroiled in the college admissions scandal wanted to be certain that their children would get in.

A college may want someone who can play the cello or the piano. The next year, it may want students from the Midwest of the South. The following year, it may prefer students who can pay full-freight or those whose relatives attended the school.

The bribery scandal will likely raise questions about what's fair for schools to consider, Dodds said. The allegations bring added scrutiny to the role athletics plays in the admissions process. Singer bribed athletic coaches to reserve spaces for his clients, even though they didn't play the sport in question.

The FBI case showed that a small group of people allegedly ""hacked"" a vulnerability in the college recruitment for minor sports, said Jim Jump, the director of college counseling at St. Christopher's School, a private boys school in Richmond, Va.

The ability to play a sport appears to carry a lot of weight at least at some colleges. Harvard rates applications on four categories -- academic excellence, extracurricular activities, personal qualities and athletics -- according to court documents in the affirmative action lawsuit.

In addition, the acceptance rate for recruited athletes is about 86 percent versus six percent for non-athletes, according to an analysis of applications by an economist hired by the organization suing Harvard.

Why do parents covet spots at these elite schools?

Colleges make the spots seem like a scarce resource, which only makes families covet them more, Jump said. These ""are supposed to be metrics for quality, which I don't think they are,"" Jump said.

Schools go to great lengths to increase the number of applications they receive in part to push the share of students they admit down, allowing them to appear more selective -- an important factor in college rankings.

Instead, the schools that fare the best on rankings and other metrics often have their pick of the best and wealthiest students who would likely be successful no matter where they went.

That means these colleges do little to transform the trajectory of the bulk of their students -- that job is left up to many community colleges and less selective four-year schools.

Nonetheless, these schools do offer something not available at lesser-known colleges: Prestige. That can be very powerful, said Mark Huelsman, associate director of research and policy at Demos, a left-leaning think tank.

Graduating from a top college provides entry into a network that dominates the worlds of finance, politics, media and a slew of other industries. That can help certain r√©sum√©s rise from the bottom to the top of a very large pile, he said.

For those whom the experience of attending an elite college might truly be transformative -- less wealthy students -- the cumulative advantage that wealth provides means that they're much less likely to secure one of those coveted spots. Some top colleges have more students from families in the one percent than students from families in the bottom 60 percent of the income spectrum.

Huelsman said this story pulled back the curtain on something that many people were already aware of: An ecosystem of privileged institutions, wealthy families and knowledge of how to game the system. ""It's not based on a meritocracy,"" he said.",324,New York Post,Are elite colleges really a 'golden ticket' to a successful life?
"Whom will the Democrats pick to face Donald Trump in 2020? Polls this early don't matter much: They just tell you who is well-known. Early money doesn't ensure anything either, although the 2016 Republican race showed how quickly candidates without a huge fundraising base can go broke and drop out months before the voting starts. Endorsements hardly matter at all when there are still this many candidates, and they matter a lot less now that the Democrats have stripped most of the power from elected superdelegates. Instead, the ability to pull ahead in five lanes will decide who leads the field: race and gender; age and familiarity; anger; ideology; and the Midwest question.

Who's In, Who's Out

It's early yet. Nobody in March 2015 expected Donald Trump to crash a similarly overpopulated Republican field. But the crowd on the fence is dwindling quickly, as pressure mounts to be in or out. At this writing, there are 13 ""major"" candidates in the race, and I count six others who are at least semi-seriously mulling a run, which could leave the Democrats with a field as large as or larger than the ridiculous 17-candidate Republican field in 2016:

With Beto O'Rourke's announcement this morning, Joe Biden is the last major contender on the fence. Eric Swalwell, Steve Bullock, and Michael Bennet have all been scouting out Iowa (Swalwell's home state) or New Hampshire (Bennet has been running digital ads in early states). Bennet seems the least likely of these to run, given John Hickenlooper's entry in the race (Bennet was running the Denver schools back when Hickenlooper was mayor of Denver, so their fundraising bases overlap closely). Given the palpable desire to finally put the Clinton era in the rearview mirror, it is hard to see the rationale for a Terry McAuliffe campaign. Stacey Abrams, who lost the Georgia governor's race in 2018, has lately begun musing about a run and reversed herself Monday after appearing to shut the door. With a late start organizing and never having won election above the state-house level, Abrams seems much likelier to stick to a 2020 Senate run or plan for a rematch for governor.

Four possible candidates passed on a run last week: Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, Oregon senator Jeff Merkley, former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. The biggest of all to stay out thus far is Michelle Obama. The Democratic party today, while united against Donald Trump, is riven by many internal divides, but a recent poll found that ""Obama Democrat"" remains a more popular self-identifier than any ideological label (Republicans, by contrast, still prefer ""conservative Republican"" to ""Trump Republican""). Mrs. Obama, with universal name recognition and beloved by virtually every segment of the party, is the one candidate who could have cleared the field, uniting the disparate factions that never went into open rebellion under her husband and tapping into his fundraising network. She has, however, never run for office or shown much enthusiasm for suggestions that she do so. Moreover, the failure of Hillary Clinton's two campaigns stand as a reminder that presidential coalitions can't just be inherited.

Lane 1: Race and Gender

In a better world, race-and-gender identity politics would not be a major factor in choosing a commander-in-chief, and a reductive analysis of voters along racial lines would not explain much of our politics. Sadly, we do not live in that world, and the internal politics of the modern Democratic party in particular are impossible to understand without starting with race and gender.

The race and gender identities of the candidates have been front and center in many state and national Democratic primaries since 2008's Obama-Hillary race. The 2018 election cycle saw female Democrats win primaries in disproportionate numbers, a fact much touted by Democrats and their partisans. Many of the 2020 contenders and their supporters are not subtle about trumpeting the benefits of running a woman (or, in Pete Buttigieg's case, the first openly gay candidate). We can best illustrate the role of race in particular by looking at the 2020 primary calendar and the 2008 and 2016 primary fights.

Consider first what the Democratic electorate will look like. Exit polls are not available for every contest (especially caucuses), nor are they without their own inaccuracies, but we have a primary exit poll from 2016, 2008, or both in 39 of the 57 Democratic contests, and they show an electorate that ranges from slightly to heavily majority-female, and that varies widely from state to state in its racial composition. In 26 of those 39 primary contests, the Democratic electorate was at least 57 percent female, in some cases as high as 64 percent (electorates with more nonwhite voters tend to be more heavily female, for a variety of depressing reasons):

Adding a rough estimate based on the general-election demographics for the remaining states and territories, 1,621 delegates (36 percent of the 4,532 total, or 72 percent of the majority needed to win) will be selected by primary contests where white voters are likely to be a minority. I include California and New Mexico in that tally, despite 2008 exit polls showing majority-white electorates; those polls were taken over a decade ago, and the demographics have continued to shift.

Those shifts are evident in states where exit polls are available for both 2008 and 2016. While you might have expected a larger turnout of African-American voters in the 2008 primary due to the presence of Barack Obama on the ballot, the 2016 Democratic electorate regularly featured more black voters and fewer white voters than 2008. In South Carolina, for example, the Democratic-primary electorate was 43 percent white and 55 percent black in 2008, 35 percent white and 61 percent black in 2016. By 2016, black women alone (37 percent of the primary voters) outnumbered all white voters in the South Carolina primary. In Texas, white voters declined from 49 percent to 43 percent. That reflects overall trends within the party, especially in the South and Midwest: Older, white ancestral Democrats died off or left the party in the Obama years, while younger generations of Democrats included more nonwhite voters. Obama's general-election campaigns also increased the registration and participation rates among African-American voters in particular. African-American women remain the most reliably Democratic of all voter demographics, and turnout among black women is now at least competitive with that of any other voter group, quite unlike pre-Obama turnout patterns. That has major implications for Democratic primaries.

Adding in the next set of primary contests, in which white voters are likely to be less than 70 percent of all Democrats, pushes the total to 2,969 delegates, 66 percent of the total. That's a large enough nonwhite vote to be decisive if nonwhite voters are unified while white voters are divided.

Nonwhite voters are hardly a monolith, of course. Mexican immigrants living in California cities, African Americans living in rural Mississippi, and native Hawaiians are quite different groups of people. The point here is simply that an awful lot of delegate selection will be done in states where nonwhite voters are a very large factor. Of the 15 states that choose at least 100 delegates, it is likely that five will have majority-nonwhite primary electorates and six will have electorates that are below 70 percent white, while only two (Massachusetts and Washington) will be above 80 percent white.

The combination of voter demographics and voter mood is one reason that the white male candidates have been disproportionately hesitant to jump into this field. In the states where we have more specific breakdowns, white men were a quarter or less of Democratic voters in South Carolina, Texas, Florida, New York, Alabama, and Georgia in 2016, and California and New Jersey in 2008, with Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina not far behind.

How much does that matter to how the voters vote? The dividing lines can be graphically illustrated by grouping the Democratic contests by their winners in 2008 and 2016. Contests won by both Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton tended to be overwhelmingly white states, mainly smaller states with caucuses dominated by progressive activists or primaries with less overwhelmingly female electorates:

(""DA"" is the Democrats Abroad primary). Notice Wisconsin is on that list; there were nine states that Hillary Clinton lost in all three of her presidential races (against Obama, Bernie, and Trump). Eight of those were red states west of the Kansas-Missouri border; the other was Wisconsin, whose unique combination of green activists and Feingold/LaFollette good-government voters never warmed to Mrs. Clinton.

Turning to the states that flipped from Obama in 2008 to Hillary in 2016 -- thus, the states that decided both races -- a stark contrast appears to the Obama-Bernie states: Every one of them except Iowa had a significant black population. The Clintons were always popular with African-American voters, and given the choice between Hillary and Bernie, they chose Mrs. Clinton in large numbers; given the choice between Hillary and Obama, those voters went overwhelmingly for Obama. South Carolina set the tone: Hillary beat Bernie 86-14 among African-American voters after losing them 78-19 to Obama. This was a recurring trend; as Andrew Prokop at Vox put it:

Obama won every primary in the eight states where more than 20 percent of the population is black, and sometimes racked up huge margins in them. This dominance was because he won the votes of between 78 and 91 percent of black voters in each of these states, according to exit polls. He'd net over 100 delegates from these eight states -- close to the margin of his pledged delegate lead when the primary season ended.

Bernie Sanders, despite re-creating the ideological element of Obama's coalition, failed to re-create the racial element, and that, by itself, cost him the nomination.

The contests that Hillary Clinton won twice present a different picture. These states on average had nearly as many Hispanic voters as black voters (many have large immigrant populations) and a lot more female voters compared with the Bernie states. They also tended to be states with closed primaries rather than caucuses (and thus more Democratic partisans than ideological progressives). Pew estimated that Hillary beat Obama 68-32 among Hispanic voters, and she continued that trend against Bernie. The list includes many of the nation's largest states as well as the last remnants of Bill Clinton's Arkansas-centric white-working-class coalition:

Completing the picture is the handful of states that backed the loser both times, going from Hillary to Bernie. These were mostly-white states, all with primaries, none of them closed to non-Democrats, and all with a substantial number of the prototypically Trumpy white working-class voters (West Virginia being the state where 41 percent of the Democratic-primary voters in 2012 preferred an incarcerated felon to renominating President Obama):

What does this all mean for the current field? The controversies of the Trump and #MeToo era and the increasingly vocal nature of ""woke"" activism have made it common to hear prominent voices say openly that Democrats need to run a candidate against Trump who is not male, not white, or both. That could be particularly bad news for the two best-known candidates, Sanders and Biden, both very old white men who cut their political teeth in the very different world of the 1970s. Bernie has often struggled to connect to nonwhite voters and activists and has openly argued for a shift in emphasis from cultural to economic issues, in line with the Daily Worker ethos of his youth. Biden, for his part, has a decades-long trail of ""problematic"" statements and positions (especially on crime and drugs, as he was long the most ardent drug warrior in Congress), though he also has the residual glow of association with Obama.

The challenge for Sanders in particular comes into view when you look at the primary calendar sequentially, according to when each state votes:

The first two states, Iowa and New Hampshire, are both potentially strong territory for Sanders. Iowa is a caucus, New Hampshire is an open primary in a state next door to his home state, and both are overwhelmingly white (a fact that has led to a lot of grumbling from progressive activists about their primacy on the calendar). Bernie won New Hampshire in 2016, and with a crowded field, he could win both without needing to get past 25 to 30 percent of the vote. It's possible to win the nomination without winning either of those two states (Bill Clinton did it in 1992), but nobody in either party since Maine's Edmund Muskie in 1972 has won both without winning the nomination.

But look ahead to March 17, five weeks after New Hampshire. By that point, 64 percent of the delegates will have been chosen. Some 93 percent of those delegates will be selected by primaries, not caucuses; 46 percent of the delegates through March 17 will be chosen by states likely to have majority-nonwhite electorates, and another 22.6 percent by states where white voters are likely to be below 70 percent. This is not Bernie Country. If he hasn't shown overwhelming strength in the first two primaries, he's going to find himself swimming against the tide.

""Lanes"" matter in any crowded primary, and the most obvious beneficiary, if Democratic voters line up along race and gender lanes, is Kamala Harris. The current field includes three white women (Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren), one African-American man (Cory Booker), one Hispanic man (Julian Castro, who seems unlikely to be a top-tier candidate), and one woman of part-Samoan heritage (Tulsi Gabbard, who is something of a boutique anti-war candidate). Abrams is the only potential entrant who isn't a white male, and she probably won't run.

That leaves Harris as the only African-American woman in the race. If she can marginalize Gabbard and drive Booker off the field before South Carolina, she could end up as both the only black candidate and the only woman of color. She and Swalwell are also the only Californians. The largest state votes on Super Tuesday, March 3, a big change from its end-of-the-race June position in the last two cycles. While some observers question where Harris fits in ideological ""lanes,"" her ability to claim a distinctive race-and-gender lane while also claiming the most valuable geographic base seems likely to be much more consequential. That also drives her strategic choices: Nothing can be more important to Harris than getting Booker out of the race as early as possible.

Recent history shows that race and gender identity matters to the lanes in a Democratic primary in ways it would not in a Republican race. For all the wedge issues his campaign raised, in 2016 it would have been ridiculous for Donald Trump to argue that voters should support him just because he was white and male; there were eleven other white-male candidates in the race. Despite the overwhelmingly white Republican electorate, Trump's chief competition came from the two Hispanic candidates (Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio got more votes between them in contested primaries and caucuses than Trump did), and the lone African American in the race, Ben Carson, was the only candidate to ever lead Trump in the national poll averages. If there's a candidate-identity issue that plays out more openly among Republicans, it's not race or gender but religion, as the divisive 2008 spats between Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney illustrated.

Lane 2: Age and Familiarity

There's a second way in which Democratic presidential-primary voters behave differently from Republican presidential-primary voters: They are much more enamored with youth and fresh faces. Since 1952, Republicans have nominated a non-incumbent candidate age 60 or older (on Election Day) eight times in eleven races, including four of the six non-incumbent Republican presidents elected in that period. By contrast, Democrats have not elected a non-incumbent president aged 60 or older since James Buchanan in 1856, and have nominated only two non-incumbent candidates over 60 since 1876: Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. The average age of newly elected Democratic presidents is 53, and it drops to 49 if you count only the seven elected since the Civil War:

Democrats also deviate from Republicans' pronounced tendency to pick the ""next in line"" candidate. Every non-incumbent Republican nominee since 1968 had run for the job before except for George W. Bush, whose father had been president just eight years earlier. Granted, Trump had not been a serious candidate before, but he had been nationally famous for over three decades, ran in the Reform-party primary in 2000, and had been publicly musing about running for years.

Democrats are different. Before Hillary, the only non-incumbent nominees since William Jennings Bryan who had run before were Al Gore (who had run in 1988), George McGovern (who ran briefly in 1968), Adlai Stevenson (who was nominated in both 1952 and 1956), and Al Smith (who had run at the convention in 1924). All of them lost, as Bryan did. The last successful Democratic presidential aspirant who wasn't a first-timer was James Buchanan. Let's stack up the current field by age and prior campaigns against past winning Democrats:

This is the second strike against Biden and Sanders: They may have experience, name recognition, and a road-tested background and message, but Democratic-primary voters traditionally do not want those things. In fact, nominating men even older than Trump would throw away the Democrats' ability to enthuse young voters, who instinctively prefer youthfulness and a fresh face. Since 1992, the Democrats have lost elections in 2000 (when they ran a candidate who had run for president before), 2004 (when they ran a 60-plus candidate), and 2016 (when they ran a candidate who was 60-plus and had run before). Age is also a strike against Warren, Inslee, Hickenlooper, and even Klobuchar. The candidates closer to the historical sweet spot are Harris, Gillibrand, and Booker; the ones right in the heartland are Abrams and Beto O'Rourke. O'Rourke best fits the Obama-Bill Clinton-JFK vigor-and-glamour mold: tall, lean, Kennedy-handsome, at turns soulful and reckless, a guy who was in a band and has been known to skateboard on stage. He's the one who inspires all the swoony press profiles.

History also suggests that Democrats will look past their early leaders. Some primary campaigns have a dominating front-runner and some do not. Dominating front-runners win almost all the time in both parties, although the two most prominent counterexamples come from youth rebellions on the Democratic side: Obama's 2008 victory over Hillary and Lyndon Johnson's 1968 withdrawal after a challenge by Eugene McCarthy.

Looking at the five modern Democratic primaries without a dominating front-runner, only one (Kerry in 2004) was won easily by a well-known figure who started at the front of the pack. McGovern in 1972 was, while not a first-time candidate, a fresher face than warmed-over 1968 candidates Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace, and he successfully cast himself as the anti-establishment alternative to the early front-runner, Muskie. Muskie was eight years older than McGovern and had been in public office for 26 years.

The 2020 primary so far looks more like the other three wide-open races with Democrats out of power, in 1992, 1988, and 1976. All were won by dark-horse candidates. Nate Silver looked at the Democratic-primary poll averages from 1972 to 2008 for this point in the race (January to July of the year before the primary) and found that the winners were often far off the voters' radar, polling in single digits in the middle or rear of the pack and unknown to half or more of the voters:

For now, national polls and polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show half or more of the voters preferring Biden or Sanders, but that is unsurprising given their high name recognition. Even candidates like Gillibrand, who is barely registering in polls, can take hope from the trajectory of Bill Clinton in 1992. That said, polls showing that Harris has pulled ahead of Warren in New Hampshire -- where Warren is already a well-known senator from a neighboring state -- have to be worrying to Warren.

The complicating factor for a dark-horse candidate is the compressed time frame of the primary calendar. It may be harder now to build from a slow start than it was when McGovern got his first win in the fourth contest, or Bill Clinton in the fifth. But because Democrats -- again, unlike Republicans -- distribute delegates proportionally and have no winner-take-all states, it is not as easy for competitive candidates to be mathematically all but eliminated by the first week of March.

Lane 3: Anger

The next lane that we should expect to matter a lot in the 2020 primaries is less easily quantified: anger. The voters of the party out of power are always driven to some extent by anger, and doubly so when running against an incumbent.

Anger can play out in unpredictable ways, however. Republicans in 2016 passed on the candidates who were the most caustically critical of Barack Obama (such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Bobby Jindal), in part because Donald Trump's belligerent demeanor and willingness to ""go there"" with personal attacks (such as Obama's birth certificate or, later, Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct) made him feel like the candidate most viscerally embodying anger. By contrast, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and George W. Bush in 2000 both channeled anger at scandal-ridden predecessors not by direct criticisms (which both of them downplayed, unlike some of their opponents) but by aspirational appeals to honesty and dignity in the office, which doubled as veiled shots. John Kerry wasn't as visibly worked up as Howard Dean, but he gave Democrats the chance to attack George W. Bush's lack of war service by building his campaign around Kerry's own Vietnam service.

Democrats today are as angry as any out-of-power party in memory. One example: the latest national Economist/YouGov poll finds that:

* 79 percent of Democrats say yes when asked if ""Donald Trump has EVER committed anything that might be considered a serious crime.""

* 70 percent of Democrats say yes when asked if ""Donald Trump himself did anything illegal in his dealings with Russian officials before the Inauguration.""

* 65 percent of Democrats believe that ""Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald Trump elected President.""

* 83 percent of Democrats believe that ""Russia hacked the email of Democrats in order to increase the chance that Donald Trump would win the Presidential election.""

* 41 percent of Democrats believe that ""Millions of illegal votes were cast in the [2016] election.""

* 66 percent of Democrats believe that ""Donald Trump will get us into a war.""

Not only is this an electorate that thinks the president is a criminal who stole the election, it's an electorate that is willing to believe conspiracy theories with no evidence (Russians tampering with vote tallies) in order to justify that anger.

A July 2018 Quinnipiac poll found that 86 percent of Democrats think ""President Trump is racist,"" and Democratic voters' low opinion extends to members of the other party in general: A November 2018 Axios/Survey Monkey online poll found that 61 percent of Democrats described Republicans as ""racist,"" ""bigoted,"" and/or ""sexist,"" 54 percent said ""ignorant,"" 44 percent said ""spiteful,"" and 21 percent said ""evil."" David French wrote more about polls of this nature yesterday.

Old-fashioned appeals to bipartisan bonhomie and unifying, upbeat rhetoric will play very badly in this atmosphere. Joe Biden recently referred to Mike Pence as ""a decent guy, our vice president,"" which in normal conditions would not be considered heresy. After the inevitable storm of criticism on Twitter, Biden backtracked, telling actress Cynthia Nixon:

Warren pounced on the comment, saying ""No"" to a reporter who asked, ""You don't think the Vice President is a decent man?"" When asked ""if she saw anyone in the Trump Admin as decent[, ]Warren didn't offer any names-said it was a 'tough question,' rattled off the indictments from Mueller rpt & cabinet scandals, added 'this is the most corrupt administration in living history.'""

The need to out-Trump Trump in performative displays of uncompromising anger and glib, tweet-sized soundbites plays best to the strengths of Harris and Warren. While Booker and Gillibrand have worked assiduously to play on that turf, both give off a powerful vibe of trying too hard when they do so. Booker in particular is plainly more at home being sunny and upbeat. For Democratic partisans looking for a no-quarter-ever approach, Gillibrand is still struggling to live down ill will from her role in pushing Al Franken out of the Senate. There may even be uncomfortable questions about the fact that Harris, Booker, Gillibrand, Biden, and McAuliffe all raised money from the Trump family, some of them in the not-too-distant past.

On the other hand, if Democratic voters are looking to counter-program Trump with an un-Trump in the way that Carter and George W. Bush cast themselves as the un-Nixon and un-Clinton, that could play to the strengths of O'Rourke, Biden (who can invoke the still-popular Obama years), Booker (if he drops the Spartacus act), or the publicly low-key Klobuchar.

Lane 4: Ideology

Political observers tend to see the ""lanes"" in a primary mainly in terms of issues and ideology. Sometimes, that's true: Bernie ran hard against Hillary as too corporate-friendly, and Obama ran against her on the Iraq War, just as McGovern had run an uncompromising anti-Vietnam race. Yet, as we have seen, other factors better explain the dynamics of many past Democratic contests.

Opinion polls paint a divergent picture of the Democratic electorate. On the one hand, many Democrats tell pollsters that they are moderates who want the party to run a moderate candidate. Just because they are angry at Donald Trump doesn't mean they are suddenly eager to self-identify as socialists. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of the electorate as a whole found that 87 percent of voters are enthusiastic about or comfortable with an African-American candidate, 86 percent with a white man, and 84 percent with a woman, but only 37 percent with a candidate over age 75, and 25 percent with a socialist. This is not good news for Bernie Sanders. Candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, and Hickenlooper, who frame themselves as the mainstream Main Street alternatives, can benefit from this.

On the other hand, when individual issues are polled, Democratic voters are increasingly willing to embrace left-wing positions, suggesting that their enthusiasm for centrism is more about their self-image than about the message they want to hear from the candidates. An increasing number of younger voters genuinely believe the apocalyptic rhetoric of man-made climate change ending life on earth in the near future, and at least one candidate (Jay Inslee) has promised to make this his central message. Moreover, bold positions on the issues can grab the attention of party activists, who are more engaged early in the process, as well as young voters who value a transformative message. As a result, the competition to show woke, green, or socialist bona fides will be ferocious. We've already seen multiple major contenders floating stances that would have been viewed as marginal in years past: banning private health insurance, legalizing marijuana and prostitution, banning all semi-automatic weapons, free college, reparations for slavery, packing the Supreme Court by expanding it to as many as 15 justices, guaranteed income for people unwilling to work, abolishing border barriers and border enforcement, and the Green New Deal, with its utopian aspirations to eliminate cars, air travel, and meat-eating.

None of the candidates yet seem immune to this headlong rush, but inevitably, as the field narrows, some of them will likely take up the challenge of criticizing each other's proposals as unworkable and impossible to enact. Meanwhile, the candidates with longer records in office could find themselves facing a backlash for past stances that are now seen by younger Democrats not only as wrong but as positively immoral or bigoted. Biden has the biggest problem with this, but Booker is still viewed with suspicion for his once-prominent advocacy of school choice, Gillibrand for a whole host of issues on which she has ""evolved"" from her Blue Dog days as an upstate New York congresswoman, Sanders on guns and immigration, and even Harris and Klobuchar for their track records as hard-charging prosecutors. Klobuchar's now-notorious record as an abusive boss is also out of step with the way many Democrats see their values in general and their contrast with Trump in particular. The advantage may end up lying with the candidates with the vaguest records, who will be most able to adjust to where they think the voters will be.

Lane 5: The Midwest Question

The final ""lane"" question is as much one of strategy as of popular mood, but it could make a difference in how voters and opinion leaders see their final choice: Are Democratic voters worried about white working-class voters in the Midwest? The biggest surprise of 2016 was not Trump winning Obama states that had been won twice by George W. Bush (Florida and Ohio) or states that had returned to the Republican fold for Mitt Romney (North Carolina and Indiana), but his victories in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, and Maine's second congressional district. Those victories, in states without significant Hispanic populations and with only modest African-American populations, were driven by Trump's strength among white working-class voters, who offset the college-educated white suburban voters that Trump drove away. Or were they? In Wisconsin, for example, Trump got fewer votes than Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan did, and won the state entirely on the strength of depressed Democratic turnout for Hillary Clinton.

Right now, especially after relatively strong Republican midterm showings in Florida and Ohio, the remaining Midwestern states look like the weakest link of Trump's coalition. Should Democrats try to win those white working-class voters back? Should they be worried about holding onto the more moderate suburbanites who flocked to their banner in 2016 and 2018?

There are three schools of thought. One, of course, is that Republican routs across the Midwest in the 2018 midterms, combined with Trump's low approval rating in many of those states, means they are already in the bag. If that is true, Trump is as good as dead, and Democrats can look past the election in choosing their nominee. This is probably a poor way to think strategically, but there is something to be said for the idea that primary voters are terrible judges of ""electability"" and should just vote their hearts.

The second school of thought is that white working-class voters are a lost cause, especially in the Midwest and South, and the future lies in turning out more nonwhite voters and targeting five ""blue-future"" states: Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. There is some basis in recent history, and not just in Obama's two elections, for thinking that nonwhite voter turnout for Democrats is likely to be helped significantly when nonwhite candidates are on the ballot. In 2014, 93 percent of all Democratic candidates for senator or governor were white, and the results for the party were not pretty.

Here as well, there are cautions. For all the scorn heaped by liberal commentators on the white working class since the rise of Trump, and all the hype around demographic change, white working-class voters in 2016 were still the largest demographic component of the Democratic coalition. Progressive Democrats did show in 2018 that they could turn out a lot more voters in the blue-future states -- but other than Kyrsten Sinema's narrow victory in the Arizona Senate race, Democrats still lost most of the statewide contests in the blue-future states even in 2018. Proponents of this school of thought are likely to lean most heavily toward Harris, O'Rourke, Booker, or Abrams.

The third school of thought is that Millennial, Generation Z, and nonwhite voters may be the future of the Democratic coalition, but the electoral map in 2020 still requires Democrats to win back more white working-class voters without compromising their gains among moderate suburbanites (that's clearly the thinking behind the announcement that the 2020 Democratic convention will be in Milwaukee). But how? With the economic populism of Sanders, Warren, or Harris? With the methodical ""Minnesota Nice"" of Klobuchar? With the old-time backslapping of Biden? With a red-state governor such as Bullock? Sherrod Brown was seen as a major player in this space, as a Democrat who won easily in Ohio in 2018, but a Midwest-focused approach would seem to favor Biden or Klobuchar.

Other than caucuses in Iowa and Klobuchar's home state of Minnesota, however, the Midwest does not start voting until March 10, when Ohio and Michigan hold primaries. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are in April, Indiana in May. Voters in the rest of the country are likely to have decided a lot about the shape of the field by then.

The Five-Lane Highway

If you have read this far, you can probably guess that I think the five-lane dynamics of 2020 point toward Kamala Harris as the most likely Democratic nominee, with Cory Booker as her major obstacle but Beto O'Rourke and Amy Klobuchar as the rivals she should most fear. Harris has the demographic advantage of her race and gender, she's not old or stale, she speaks to Democratic voters' desire for someone who can take on Donald Trump on his own blunt, emotional terms, and she's willing to stake out dramatic left-wing positions. Harris is the candidate most likely to fill multiple lanes at once, and only Biden rivals her odds of putting the nomination away relatively early.

O'Rourke combines youth and freshness with the unquantifiable ""It Factor"" of charismatic men who have taken the Democratic nomination in the past. Because his path forward relies so much on glamour and excitement, Beto needs to worry less about any individual competitor (other than possibly Booker or Sanders) than about doing well enough early to project an image that sizzles. This makes his campaign strategically similar to that of Marco Rubio, who specialized in winning late-deciding voters in the early 2016 primaries but fizzled out badly once he fell far enough behind that he no longer looked like a winner. Rubio, however, had to absorb heavy negative ad targeting from a home-state candidate with the biggest war chest in the field (Jeb Bush), competition from a candidate with a strikingly similar ideological and demographic profile (Cruz), and a kamikaze attack on the debate stage (Chris Christie). The first two of those, at least, will not be problems for Beto. But running on being the New Thing means there is always a threat that one of the unknowns could become the Even Newer Thing, and indeed, there is already a boomlet among some commentators for Pete Buttigieg.

Booker relies on some of the same calculus as Beto, with the added possibility of competing directly with Harris for African-American voters, but he's also perhaps the hardest candidate in the field to peg. Other than the obvious early front-runners Biden and Sanders, Booker is the candidate who is an obstacle to the most other paths.

Klobuchar, in contrast to Harris and O'Rourke, can position herself as the Midwestern alternative to a Democratic party that has become overly reliant on the coasts and needs to reassure suburbanites and win back working-class heartland voters. Her path forward improves substantially if Biden chooses not to run, and if she can squeeze Gillibrand out early. The last three candidates remaining in the race will most likely include 1) either Harris, Booker, or Warren, 2) one of O'Rourke, Sanders or Booker, and 3) either Biden or Klobuchar.

The two high-profile candidates who seem least likely to catch fire are Warren and Gillibrand, both of whom would have ranked a lot higher two or three years ago. Warren now looks very much like a candidate who missed her shot and should have run in 2016, when she fit the populist mood. Whether the problem is her age, her personality, her stumbles in the controversy over her claim to Native American heritage, or Sanders' continuing hold on the voters she needs and the message she preaches, she will have to make a strong showing in New Hampshire to avoid being run off early. Gillibrand may look strong on paper and, like Warren, she could benefit from the same gender politics that help Harris and Klobuchar, but her ideological shape-shifting is emblematic of her general air of inauthenticity, and it's a very long wait in the primary calendar for her New York base to come into play.

For all that, Democrats might still pick a white male in his late 70s. Biden is too well-known and well-liked to write him off just yet, and Sanders still has an army in the field from 2016.",325,nationalreview.com,Five Lanes in the 2020 Democratic Field
"Earlier this morning, Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke announced that he's running for president, and there are two things I believe with equal intensity. First, I don't want Beto to be president. He's a culturally left economic progressive who may be the serious candidate closest to an actual open-borders position on immigration. Second, I don't want to see the Democratic party become so radical -- and so obsessed with matters of race and privilege -- that even Beto is too ""moderate"" to win.

So, in the woke war against Beto, I'm rooting for Beto to win.

And make no mistake, the woke war is on. Just read the critiques that have been rolling in from the online Left. At CNN, Nia-Malika Henderson argues that Beto's ""adventures"" after his Senate loss to Ted Cruz ""drip with white male privilege."" ""His political identity,"" she claims, ""is predicated on being white and male."" It's this ""privilege"" that ""allows him to turn a loss to the most despised candidate of the cycle into a launching pad for a White House run.""

At the New York Times, Lisa Lerer analyzed the alleged ""privilege of being Beto"" and reported on simmering resentment in Democratic ranks:

In quiet and not-so-quiet complaints, Democratic strategists argue that the relatively positive reception to Mr. O'Rourke's untraditional approach is evidence, yet again, of the deep double standard female candidates face. While his defenders argue that Mr. O'Rourke can't be blamed for gender dynamics he didn't create, his critics say he is being given a benefit of the doubt that wouldn't be extended to a woman or a candidate of color.

And if we want to talk about pure policy, the Washington Post's Elizabeth Bruenig makes the socialist case against Beto. Bruenig only calls him ""progressive-ish."" He didn't join the House Progressive Caucus. He didn't sponsor House single-payer or free-college bills. He calls the ""decision between oil and gas and renewable energy sources 'a false choice.'""

To conservative ears, the idea of Beto as a progressive squish sounds odd. After all, this is the same guy who told MSNBC's Chris Hayes that he'd take down the wall between El Paso and Mexico. He's resolute on abortion rights. He's fluent in intersectionality. He wants to ban so-called assault weapons.

But he's an Obama-style progressive when millions of members of the Democratic-party base have moved on. They're frustrated with Obama-style politics. They've given up on unifying messages. They're sick of white men, unless the white man is an avowed socialist -- and even then he's still suspect.

I know there are Republicans who chortle at all this. There's a long bipartisan history of rooting for the opposing party to go nuts -- to nominate someone either so extreme or so bizarre that they guarantee an electoral loss. Remember this famous National Review cover?

<<Insert image>>

But never forget that in 2016 the Democrats did their share of chortling when Donald Trump dominated the primaries. They thought it was hilarious that Republicans had actually nominated the least-liked politician in the history of favorability polling. They kept laughing until about 11:00 p.m. on Election Night -- when Florida was lost, Ohio was lost, and it looked quite clear that the Philadelphia precincts weren't going to save Hillary from disaster.

Right now, the Democratic front-runner is a man who used to gush with praise for the Soviet Union and even defended bread lines. Another leading contender has proudly promised to eliminate every private health-insurance program in America. Virtually every important Democratic candidate (including Beto) has endorsed or spoken glowingly about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal -- a progressive program of staggering expense and scope.

So now it's the Republicans' turn to laugh. That's a curious position for a party that just lost the House and got crushed by suburban Americans who were once loyal GOP voters. It's an especially curious position for a party whose standard-bearer is sitting on a 41.7 percent approval rating -- just as it was curious for Democrats to feel so confident when Hillary was at their helm.

In a time of extreme polarization, ideology matters far less than party identification, and it's now entirely possible that even Bernie Sanders could win the White House. It's possible that the ideas that were once on the fringe even of Democratic politics in, say, 2012 could become the signature legislative initiatives of a new Democratic president. Against this backdrop -- and for the health of the republic -- it's time for Americans to root for both parties to pick the least-bad option. Consequently, if Beto stands between the Democrats and the full embrace of both socialism and identity politics, then I'll take Beto every time.",326,nationalreview.com,"In the Woke War against Beto, Root for Beto"
"Trump tweets 'veto!' in response to Senate vote to terminate the president's emergency declaration for border.

Senate Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues on Thursday in voting to block President Trump's border emergency declaration -- a move that will prompt the president's first-ever veto.

The president made his intentions crystal clear, tweeting ""VETO!"" moments after the resolution cleared Congress. The White House said Trump likely would issue the veto Friday.

The measure passed 59-41 as a dozen Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the resolution, despite White House efforts to keep the GOP united on the issue of border security. Those GOP members who backed the resolution cited concerns about the expansion of presidential powers.

PELOSI WORKS TO DERAIL BID TO SPARE TRUMP FROM BORDER EMERGENCY REBUFF

""I'm going to be voting in favor of the resolution of disapproval,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters ahead of the vote. ""This is a constitutional question, it's a question of the balance of power that is core to our constitution.""

""This is not about the president or border security, in fact I support border security, I support a barrier,"" he said.

The other Republicans who voted to oppose the declaration were Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.; Roger Wicker, R-Miss.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Jerry Moran, R-Kan.; and Pat Toomey, R-Pa.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had said he would oppose the declaration but reversed course on the Senate floor, saying that he was ""sympathetic"" to Trump's push to deal with the crisis at the border.

SENATE VOTES TO END US SUPPORT FOR SAUDI FOCES IN YEMEN

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., before the vote, said he ""takes his hat off"" to Republicans voting with Democrats, while accusing Trump of ""going around Congress"" with the declaration.

""This is a momentous day,"" he said, declaring that the balance of power was shifting back toward Congress.

The measure heads next to Trump's desk, having previously passed the House. However, Trump plans to veto, and it's unlikely the House and Senate could muster the required two-thirds majority to override.

Trump originally issued the emergency declaration last month after Congress granted only a fraction of the $5.7 billion he requested for a wall on the southern border. Declaring a national emergency allows Trump to steer an extra $3.6 billion to the wall.

The run-up to the resolution vote was marked by last-minute efforts to avoid an intra-party confrontation, but those efforts fell through. Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, urged Republicans to support the national emergency declaration in an interview airing Thursday morning on ""Fox & Friends.""

""A vote against the president's national emergency declaration is a vote to deny the humanitarian and security crisis that's happening at our southern border. So we're urging every member of the Senate set politics aside to recognize that we have a crisis,"" he told ""Fox & Friends'"" Pete Hegseth.

Trump shrugged off the impending vote when asked about it by reporters in the Oval Office earlier Thursday.

""I don't know what the vote will be, it doesn't matter, I'll probably have to veto,"" he said.

Sen. Lee on Tuesday had introduced a bill that would automatically end future emergency declarations after 30 days, a move that might have allowed Republicans to vote against Thursday's resolution.

But after Trump said he opposed Lee's legislation, Lee said he would back the measure to rebuke Trump on the border emergency. On the Senate floor, he said while he backs Trump's policies on immigration, he could not support the emergency declaration and that Congress needed to take back its powers.

Trump tweeted ahead of the vote that if Congress wanted to amend the law governing emergency declarations in the future, ""I will support those efforts"" suggesting another last-minute push to keep Republicans on board.

"One: Andrew Hickenlooper, the great-grandfather of former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, was a general in the Union Army during the Civil War. He fought at the Battle of Shiloh, in the Vicksburg campaign, in the Atlanta campaign, and as part of General Sherman's March to the Sea. In 1879, he was elected lieutenant governor of Ohio. Andrew Hickenlooper's son, Smith Hickenlooper, fought in World War I and was a federal judge for ten years.

Two: Hickenlooper's father, also named John but usually called by his nickname ""Hick,"" worked for more than a thousand consecutive days on an assembly line at the Wright aeronautical plant in Lockland, Ohio, during World War II. He went to Cornell and befriended author Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut became friends with the younger John Hickenlooper, and for a 2004 roast of the then-mayor of Denver, the famous author declared in a joke video that he was Hickenlooper's real father.

Three: Hickenlooper's father passed away at age 40, from intestinal cancer. The younger John Hickenlooper grew up and was accepted to Wesleyan University. At the end of his junior year, he went home and made plans with a friend to see a particular much-discussed movie. He arrived back at his house to find that his mother, Anne, had prepared a big dinner. Feeling guilty after failing to appreciate her efforts, Hickenlooper invited his mother to join him and his friend at the movies that night.

The movie they attended . . . was the X-rated Deep Throat.

Hickenlooper described the night in a 2016 interview: ""I mean, the first scene was kinda raunchy. I looked at my mother, and I said, 'I think we should leave.' My mom says -- you know, my mom grew up in the Depression. Once she paid for a ticket, she was gonna use it -- 'No, no. It's okay. It's okay.'"" He said that on the ride home she declared, ""It certainly was sharply in focus.""

Four: Hickenlooper finished his master's degree in geology in 1980 -- a period of life he calls ""that decade I spent in college"" in his autobiography, The Opposite of Woe: My Life in Beer and Politics. While dating an anthropology grad student who was studying South American witchcraft and ""traveled just about everywhere with a small green and red parrot on her shoulder,"" he attended a party thrown by her parents and hung out with Yoko Ono, John Lennon's wife.

Five: Hickenlooper is a quirky man of odd habits. He moved to Colorado to take a job with Buckhorn Petroleum, where he was disappointed to find he spent 90 percent of his time ""at a desk, poring over maps prepared by other geologists."" He wrote that during this time he ""got into the habit of photocopying my correspondence before mailing it off. I figured if I kept an archive of the letters I sent, I would have them for reference when I received letters in response. This was long before email; now, we take records of 'sends' and 'receives' for granted. If you ask me, I was ahead of my time. I wrote letters and photocopied them this way for my first decade in Denver.""

Six: Upon being laid off in 1986, Hickenlooper had a year's severance and bought a 1967 red Chevy Malibu convertible for $4,200. He drove out to visit his brother Sydney in Berkeley, Calif. His brother took him to the Triple Rock Brewery and Alehouse, and the future governor instantly fell in love with brewing. ""I thought to myself, I would have driven twenty minutes out of my way without thinking twice about it to have a beer or two like this,"" he wrote in his autobiography. He and his partners were turned down by banks and other lenders 32 times, but the city of Denver gave him a $125,000 economic-development loan at 9 percent interest.

Seven: Around this time, after encouragement from a friend in Hollywood, Hickenlooper wrote a ""spec script"" -- an unsolicited submitted screenplay -- for ABC's series Moonlighting. He was told the producers liked it, but it was never used. Years later, Hickenlooper did end up in Hollywood, in a different form. His cousin George Hickenlooper became a fairly successful director, creating Dogtown, The Man From Elysian Fields, Casino Jack (starring Kevin Spacey as the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff), and an Emmy-winning documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now. The governor had several small cameos in Hickenlooper's films, making him a member of the Screen Actors Guild; George Hickenlooper passed away in 2010.

Eight: In 1989, Hickenlooper was arrested for driving while impaired. He was sentenced to community service, and at his brewpub restaurant, they instituted a designated-driver program. As governor, he signed a law toughening the penalties for driving while intoxicated, signing the bill at a ceremony held at the headquarters of a breathalyzer manufacturer.

Nine: One night at his brewery, Hickenlooper, then 42, was being teased by friends for being too busy to find a wife. He said -- he insists, jokingly -- he would pay $5,000 to the friend who introduced him to the woman he would marry, a ""bride bounty."" The Denver media picked it up and Hickenlooper ended up on The Phil Donahue Show. The host introduced him as a representative of a group of people who ""believe it's very difficult to find the man or women of your dreams, especially in this day and age, so they're willing to offer big bucks to the person who introduces them to the person they subsequently marry."" Hickenlooper married twice after that appearance; he married Helen Thorpe in 2002 and divorced in 2015, and married Robin Pringle in 2016. After his first engagement, he donated $5,000 to charity, to honor the ""bounty.""

Ten: To celebrate the second anniversary of his brewpub and restaurant, Hickenlooper hosted a pig roast. The following year, he borrowed another half-dozen pigs and staged a ""Running of the Pigs"" in an alley behind the restaurant, a sillier, less dangerous version of Pamplona's running of the bulls. He did this as an annual event for three years. When animal-rights activists complained, he put bonnets on the pigs to keep the sun out of their eyes. When they complained further, he renamed it the ""Pleasuring of the Pigs"" and promised that all of the animals would be treated with tender loving care. When the activists still complained, Hickenlooper switched to prairie dogs and called it ""Prairie Preservation Day.""

Eleven: Hickenlooper's first steps into public life came in 2000, when the owners of the NFL's Denver Broncos were building a new stadium next to Mile High Stadium, their home since 1962. Voters had approved a small sales tax two years earlier to finance the new stadium, and then the question arose of what the new stadium should be called. Hickenlooper led the public fight against a name change, adamant that the new stadium should keep the ""Mile High"" moniker associated with the city and objected to selling the naming rights to a big company.

The team arranged for an unwieldly compromise, ""Invesco Field at Mile High,"" and then ""Sports Authority Field at Mile High."" It is today called ""Broncos Stadium at Mile High.""

Ten: About two years after the stadium naming-rights fight, Hickenlooper decided to run for mayor. He hired the firm behind Jesse Ventura's unorthodox gubernatorial campaign and ads, beginning a political career driven in large part by funny commercials. His introductory ad, ""Suit,"" made fun of himself for not having a mayor-worthy wardrobe. He concluded with the conservative declaration, ""We have to find ways to get the job done for less money."" Another ad showed him making change for Denver citizens who needed to feed parking meters -- meters he called ""the fundamental nonsense of government."" Hickenlooper moved quicker than an obese, villainous parking-enforcement attendant and promised . . . ""the kind of change people can get excited about."" Hickenlooper's other campaign themes -- openness to school vouchers, opposition to new taxes, and opposition to a smoking ban in restaurants -- struck conservative notes.

The field had seven candidates, all officially ""nonpartisan,"" in a race that received national coverage as ""a model of civility."" Some coverage joked that the city's reporters already knew him well from enjoying beers at his brewpub.

Eleven: As mayor, Hickenlooper seemed to crack the code on how to raise taxes, revealing that sufficiently entertaining ads with goofy humor could move a small majority of voters to vote yes on tax-levy referendums. In 2005, Hickenlooper jumped out of a plane to promote a state referendum that would reduce state-tax refunds and suspend the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, which had passed in 1992. The referendum passed, 52 to 48 percent. In another commercial that same year, he put on a blue bear suit and danced around to successfully promote a referendum to increase taxes on hotel rooms.

Jon Caldara, the president of the Independence Institute, a free-market advocacy group in Colorado, told the New York Times that ""he has tax-increase pixie dust. No politician that I've ever worked against has been so successful in selling tax and debt increases as John Hickenlooper.""

Twelve: One of the highlights of Hickenlooper's mayoral years was Denver's hosting of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, an opportunity to spotlight the city's thriving arts scene, increasing diversity, and revitalized neighborhoods with tens of thousands of visitors and media in town. But there was one preparation for visitors that fell flat. On the preceding Earth Day, Hickenlooper had ""unveiled a newly cultivated daisy variety called the Denver daisy. He promised to distribute free seeds throughout the city and vowed that Denver would be 'awash in color.'"" (A corporate sponsor, KeyBank, covered the costs of the seeds.) Unfortunately, many citizens said they couldn't get the flowers to grow; in a bit of irony, the blooming ambitions may have been stymied by the city's water-conservation restrictions.

Thirteen: While introducing the hip-hop/rock band Flobots at a 2010 Denver music festival, then-mayor Hickenlooper waxed poetic about the joy of music with a message: ""There's rock and roll, and then there's rock and roll. There is rock and roll that's great music and there's rock and roll that tries to change the world. It tries to address who you are as people, at the core of yourself, and what you do after you leave a concert. It tries to make the world a better place. That kind of rock and roll is my kind of rock and roll, and I think that kind of rock and roll is your kind of rock and roll!""

Fourteen: In 2010, Hickenlooper ran for governor, and while Republicans were enjoying big wins in most parts of the country, the Colorado GOP was a disaster that year. Longtime Republican congressman Scott McInnis, the expected favorite for the gubernatorial nomination, faced accusations of plagiarism. Political neophyte Dan Maes won the nomination, and he was accused of exaggerating his ""undercover"" work with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. He also contended that the Denver program promoting bicycle-riding was ""part of a greater strategy to rein in American cities under a United Nations treaty."" Another longtime GOP congressman, Tom Tancredo, chose to run as the Constitution Party's nominee, splitting the right-of-center vote. Kenneth Bickers, chairman of the political-science department at the University of Colorado Boulder, characterized Hickenlooper's first statewide bid as ""winning without running."" ""He didn't travel the state heavily. He ran feel-good, clever commercials largely devoid of content.""

Continuing his tradition of goofy ads, Hickenlooper depicted himself as taking showers fully clothed, declaring, ""I can't stand negative ads. Every time I see one, I feel the need to take a shower.""

Fifteen: Hickenlooper was widely seen as a fan and close ally of President Obama's, but he did offer one mild criticism of the 44th president. In a 2011 interview with the New York Times, Hickenlooper said the early push for Obamacare had been a mistake: ""Rather than going to health care first, I would have gone, I think, to transportation infrastructure. Here's something everybody cares about. Maybe we focus on that to build bridges.""

Sixteen: For a long time, Hickenlooper's blunt talk, humorous humility, and amiable attitude worked wonders in Colorado politics. But he ran into trouble as his gubernatorial reelection bid approached. In 2013, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, Hickenlooper signed a package of gun-control measures, including private-sale background checks and a ban on large-capacity magazines and. The following year, while meeting with the county sheriffs of Colorado at their biannual meeting, Hickenlooper said he had signed a law barring high-capacity magazines only because one of his staffers had promised legislators he would. ""If we'd known it was going to divide the state so intensely, I think we probably would've thought about it twice.""

Hickenlooper, expressing regret he hadn't discussed the measures with the sheriffs before signing them, declared, ""I think we screwed that up completely, and I think we did a disservice to you and a disservice to ourselves.""

Neither side was pleased; gun-control advocates saw the governor running away from a bill he signed into law, and Second Amendment advocates saw a man signing bills into law without careful consideration. Hickenlooper won his 2014 bid, but by a much smaller margin -- 49.3 percent to Bob Beauprez's 46 percent, compared to the margin of 51.1 percent to 36.4 percent over Tom Tancredo four years earlier.

Seventeen: Hickenlooper's years as governor were an economic boom time for his state, but the rapid growth brought some new problems. The Denver Post summarized them: ""As Hickenlooper prepares to leave office January 8, there are many Coloradans who can't keep up with the cost of living. The state has no long-term transportation or infrastructure strategy. Funding for the state's public schools is still among the lowest in the nation."" More than 93 percent of Coloradans have health insurance, but the costs are soaring. Colorado saw its economy thrive for the past eight years, like most other states; most would agree that the governor's influence over that booming economy was limited.

For a governor who enjoys a reputation for being a centrist, he signed a lot of liberal priorities into law: the gun-control proposals mentioned above, renewable-energy requirements, new requirements that energy companies regularly inspect oil-field equipment for leaks, in-state tuition rates for illegal immigrants, and allowing illegal immigrants to get Colorado driver's licenses.

Eighteen: He opposed legalizing marijuana but accepted the voters' decision, and his administration implemented the taxes, regulations, and rules. In 2018, Hickenlooper noticed that crime rates were increasing and the black market for marijuana still existed. He said a return to the old ban on marijuana could be an option in the future. ""Trust me, if the data was coming back and we saw spikes in violent crime, we saw spikes in overall crime, there would be a lot of people looking for that bottle and figuring out how we get the genie back in,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem likely to me, but I'm not ruling it out.""

Nineteen: Hickenlooper is dyslexic and suffers from prosopagnosia, or face blindness, a medical condition ""that makes it difficult -- and often impossible -- to recognize or remember people's faces, even if someone with the ailment has met them a handful of times."" He says he coped in the restaurant business and politics by acting happy to see everyone all the time.

Twenty: A state ethics commission is reviewing complaints from Frank McNulty, former Republican speaker of the Colorado House, alleging that while Hickenlooper was governor he accepted gifts in violation of a 2006 state constitutional amendment. The complaint listed private jet flights, hotel stays, luxury hotel accommodations, meals and gifts, and ride in a Maserati limousine. Hickenlooper says that all of his travel expenditures were properly reported and met state legal requirements and that the criticism is a political stunt. The state ethics commission dismissed three complaints raised by McNulty but is reviewing five others.",328,nationalreview.com,Twenty Things You Didn't Know about John Hickenlooper

Whether it's President Clinton's emphatic proclamation, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman,"" or Richard Nixon's Watergate defense, ""I am not a crook,"" the lesson is the same: politicians lie.

The sad reality is that voters expect no better.

Since 1976, Gallup has been polling Americans to rank various professions from least to most ethical. Nurses are nearly always perceived to be the most honest. Politicians are consistently ranked on the opposite end of the spectrum. That means most Americans think members of Congress are more unethical than car salesmen and telemarketers. It's worth noting that politicians were ranked lowest on this list decades before Donald Trump entered the political arena.

Yet it's President Trump, not his predecessors, who has ignited the greatest outrage over dishonesty in politics. To be sure, the sheer number of times that Trump has stretched or distorted the truth can be hard to keep up with, but a liar is still a liar whether he lies seven times a day or once a week.

What it comes down to is that Americans either want honest politicians or we do not. One thing's for certain: we've done a terrible job demanding that of our presidents so far.

Just pick up any biography about any former president. Nearly every one I've read exposes its subject as having had a measurable propensity to exaggerate, mislead, and lie.

President Lyndon B. Johnson promulgated a myriad of falsehoods and cover-ups surrounding Vietnam and so much more. Distinguished historian Robert Dallek, in Lyndon B. Johnson, summed things up by repeating a popular joke from the time: ""How do you know when Lyndon Johnson is telling the truth? When he pulls his ear lobe or scratches his chin, he's telling the truth. When he begins to move his lips, you know he's lying.""

And if infidelity equals a lack of integrity, then I'd argue that Johnson's predecessor, John F. Kennedy, was one of the most dishonest presidents to have ever lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. JFK's numerous affairs are fair game when assessing his character because, as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin put it, ""Someone who refuses to deal honestly with his private life may well distort the reality he confronts in public office.""

In An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, Dallek provides details of six affairs that Kennedy juggled while he was president. Among his alleged mistresses were three White House secretaries (one was his wife Jackie's press secretary) and a 19-year-old college sophomore and White House intern. There were also reportedly numerous Hollywood stars and starlets and call girls who were paid by Dave Powers, described as ""the court jester and facilitator of Kennedy's indulgences.""

JFK's most shameful lie, though, concerned the Bay of Pigs fiasco when he promised the American people that there would be ""no military intervention in Cuba."" Just five days later on April 17, 1961, the CIA-led and Kennedy approved covert invasion of the island not only cost the lives of many, but resulted in a breakdown of trust and communication with Cuba's Fidel Castro and Russia's Nikita Khrushchev -- conditions that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt also struggled to maintain integrity, both in his personal life and in politics. For one thing, he and his administration went to great lengths to hide the extent of his health problems from voters during his New York gubernatorial and presidential campaigns. Another lie came out repeatedly when he was trying to win a third term in the White House: ""I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars."" He added at another campaign rally: ""Your president says this country is not going to war.""

His words made for good campaign rhetoric as a peace candidate, but FDR was lying. Even as he made such assurances, he knew war with Germany and Japan was likely inevitable and he and Winston Churchill were secretly planning accordingly. It's worth mentioning as well that, like Kennedy, FDR had an affair with his wife's secretary, and that according to his biographer Jean Edward Smith, it was FDR's mistress, not his wife, who was ""the last face FDR saw before he died.""

Of course, we know President Obama lied when defending the NSA and earned Politifact's ""Lie of Year"" with his repeated claim that ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" President Nixon tried to cover up his role in the Watergate scandal, President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for lying under oath, and President George W. Bush out-fibbed them all when he said there was ""no doubt"" Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, falsely justifying America's entry into yet another horrific war.

All this raises the question: if lying isn't something our nation thinks is presidential material, why do we keep electing people who lie?

And yet, the fallout of the 2016 election may be the very catalyst needed to change the status quo. To be sure, in the age of Trump, every word, deed, and tweet are examined under a microscope. Journalists scrutinize every perceived deception and talk show hosts have made politics the center of their nightly programming like never before.

While this might just be ""resistance"" outrage and the partisan nature of the media in overdrive, I celebrate the fact that we're finally having this conversation. Holding presidents -- Republican or Democrat -- to a higher standard of truth and honesty is something we seem to have lost along the way, and the integrity of the office has suffered, if not dimmed completely, as a result.

"The former vice president's appeal to Trump voters would help him in a general election, but it could also prevent him from getting there.

The wait may soon be over. This week, former vice president Joe Biden told a cheering crowd of unionized firefighters that he may soon put their enthusiasm for him to use. It's as close as Biden has come to a definite hint that he has decided to run for president, and the prospect has centrist Democrats salivating.

Biden leads in all the early polls of declared and potential Democratic presidential candidates. Though that may be primarily a function of name recognition, it's also a reflection of the fact that he is one of the few who can be considered a moderate in a field of contenders that tilts heavily to the left. With so many Democratic candidates competing for the affection of left-wing voters, running more or less alone in the middle lane ought to give him a reasonable chance of victory. But recent events have helped illustrate just how much the party has shifted away from the middle in the last four years.

The basic argument for Biden's candidacy is that he, alone among the Democratic contenders, can win back the white working-class voters who abandoned Clinton in 2016, and in so doing defeat Trump. That may very well be true, but he has to secure the party's nomination first. And as the growing attacks on him from liberals indicate, the same centrist bona fides that make him an attractive general-election candidate will hurt him in the primaries.

As House speaker Nancy Pelosi has learned in recent weeks, Democratic officeholders have started to reflect the mindset of the party's left-wing base rather than that of the establishment that handed the nomination to Clinton in 2016. Biden's problem is that anger at Trump has seemingly discredited the entire idea of moderation among the progressive grassroots. And after 47 years in politics, the self-admitted ""gaffe machine"" has given his Democratic critics plenty of ammunition.

During last fall's Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, Biden was reminded that the Left hadn't forgiven him for his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the battle over Clarence Thomas's confirmation in 1991. Thomas was taking aim at Biden, then a Delaware senator, when he famously denounced the proceedings as a ""high-tech lynching,"" and Biden did vote against him. But many on the left still blame Biden for the rough questioning of Thomas's accuser, Anita Hill, during the hearings, and have come to see him as a kind of #MeToo villain.

It's not just the specter of Anita Hill haunting Biden, either. He's also blamed as one of the people most responsible for the 1994 crime bill. At the time, the legislation had bipartisan support and reflected the priorities of President Bill Clinton in addressing the crack epidemic and a surge in violent crime. But today it's blamed for an era of racially unequal mass incarceration. In the same vein, Biden's left-wing critics, including New York Times op-ed columnist Jamelle Bouie, have begun to zero in on his opposition to the court-ordered busing of public-school students in the 1970s, a flashpoint in the racial politics of the time.

Calling any politician to account for what he said 45 years ago may seem a little unfair. No one -- not even the most strident ideologue -- lasts long in politics without changing his mind and public stances on issues over time. But Biden's opposition to busing matters to the hard left, because it exploited the same resentment of elites that fueled Trump's election. Though his condemnation of Biden as yet another advocate of ""Trumpism"" seems hyperbolic, Bouie is right when he says that the former vice president's ability to tap into voters' anger about busing was in a very real sense ""Trumpist.""

It is true that white working-class voters were a key engine of Democratic success for much of the 20th century, from Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy to Bill Clinton. Biden's career is in many ways a monument to that symbiotic relationship, but many of the Democrats enthralled by firebrands like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will see it as a handicap, one the many candidates to his left will no doubt eagerly exploit. Though Biden may yet win the nomination even so, he's unlikely to emerge from the primaries unscathed.",331,nationalreview.com,Can Biden Win Over a Democratic Party Tilting Hard to the Left? | National Review

"Former Texas congressman officially announces he will run for president in 2020.

Beto O'Rourke is the latest entry into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

But the former three-term congressman from Texas surely won't be the last.

BETO O'ROURKE JUMPS INTO 2020 RACE WITH EARLY MORNING ANNOUNCEMENT

O'Rourke - who came close to defeating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in last year's midterm elections - on Thursday morning become the 15th major Democrat to announce a candidacy or form a presidential exploratory committee.

Here's a look at who's still on the fence, and could come next:

The former vice president earlier this week dropped his clearest hint yet that he's all but certain to launch what would be his third White House bid.

Biden was greeted with chants of ""run Joe, run"" as he took the podium Tuesday in Washington, D.C. at the annual convention of the International Association of Fire Fighters union. Many in the crowd also were waving 'Run, Joe, Run,' and 'Fire Fighters for Biden' signs.

A few minutes later, during his keynote address, Biden said: ""I appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here. Save it a little longer. I may need it in a few weeks.""

Sources familiar with the planning of Biden's inner circle last week confirmed to Fox News that top advisers to the former vice president are getting their ducks in a row, figuring out a campaign structure and reaching out to veteran Democratic operatives who would be involved. Those sources pointed to a likely April campaign launch.

During a jam-packed trip last week to New Hampshire - the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House - the two-term senator told Fox News that his decision would come in ""weeks, not months.""

""I need know there's a real opportunity for me to make a difference in the race and that I could have a chance to win the race. That's what I'm trying to figure out,"" Bennet explained.

But he added that ""I'm inclined to do it.""

The two-term governor returns to New Hampshire next week. And last month he stopped in Iowa, which votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar.

While visits to the early-voting states aren't a guarantee a potential contender will actually jump into the race - think Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who recently passed on a White House run after trips to all four of the states that vote first in the nominating calendar - Bullock made a clear signal of his intent with the recent hiring of a veteran Democratic political operative.

Bullock's said he likely will not make any public announcements about his 2020 intentions until after Montana's legislative session concludes in April.

De Blasio heads to New Hampshire this weekend, fueling speculation that the two-term progressive mayor of America's largest city is seriously considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The trip follows a visit last month to Iowa, the state that votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar. And last weekend, de Blasio and his wife traveled to South Carolina, the state that holds the first southern primary along the road to the White House.

Last month, the mayor told New York City reporters ""I'm not ruling it out"" when asked about his 2020 intentions.

The congressman from the East Bay Area has also made multiple trips to the early-voting states. He recently headlined 'Politics and Eggs,' a must stop in New Hampshire for White House hopefuls.

Swalwell's hired staff in Iowa and is in the process of making hires in New Hampshire and South Carolina.

""I see nothing but green lights so far,"" he told Fox News earlier this year.

The congressman from the north shore of Massachusetts, a U.S. Marine veteran who served four tours of duty in Iraq, is headed to New Hampshire this weekend. And he'll travel to Iowa later this month.

Moulton, who was one of the ring leaders of the faction of House Democrats who unsuccessfully tried to prevent Nancy Pelosi from returning to the speakership, has said he's taking ""a very hard look"" at launching a presidential campaign.

The longtime congressman from northeast Ohio - who like Moulton was another leader of the anti-Pelosi House Democratic faction - has also been making the rounds in the early-voting states.

Ryan, during a stop last month in New Hampshire, told Fox News ""I think there's plenty of time to get to know people in Iowa and New Hampshire and the early states and raise the kind of money that you would need. I think you've got to make a decision soon, but I'm not feeling like we missed the opportunity.""

Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the Democratic Party who narrowly lost last November's gubernatorial election in Georgia, said Monday it was possible she could seek her party's presidential nomination next year.

The former Georgia House minority leader made her comments at the South by Southwest conference and festival in Austin, Texas.

The former Virginia governor -- who steered the Democratic Party in the early 2000's and remains a top friend and adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton -- has said he would decide on whether to launch a 2020 White House campaign by the end of March.

But if Biden enters the race, McAuliffe might be more inclined to pass on a presidential bid.

Asked whether he was waiting for the former vice president to make his own 2020 decision, McAuliffe told CBS News last month that he wasn't, but added he ""wants to see where the field is.""",333,Fox News,"Who's still on the fence for 2020? After Beto, these Dems could jump in next"
"Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) on Thursday became the first member of Congress to endorse former Rep. Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke's (D-TX) 2020 White House bid.

""I'm proud to endorse my friend @BetoORourke for President!"" Rice wrote in a social media post. ""He's honest, authentic and has the courage of his convictions and a bold vision for our future.""

""Most importantly, he'll build a movement that will rise above the toxic division in our politics and unite this country,"" she added.

Earlier Thursday, O'Rourke announced his candidacy for President of the United States in a video message. ""The only way for us to live up to the promise of America is to give it our all and to give it for all of us,"" O'Rourke said in the announcement with his wife Amy sitting silently by his side for the duration of the clip. ""We saw the power of this in Texas.""

""This is going to be a positive campaign that seeks to bring out the very best from every single one of us, that seeks to unite a very divided country,"" he added. ""We saw the power of this in Texas.""

The announcement came after Vanity Fair published a glowing profile on O'Rourke Wednesday evening in which the former Texas congressman hinted strongly at a White House bid.

""You can probably tell that I want to run,"" he told Vanity Fair. ""I do. I think I'd be good at it.""

O'Rourke joins an ever-growing field of Democrat presidential candidates, which includes Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to jump into the race in the coming days.

The former congressman rose to national prominence despite losing his bid to unseat incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) last November.

O'Rourke, who announced to his supporters Thursday morning he was tossing his hat in the ring for the Democratic nomination, was the star of a fawning, 8,600-word opus published by the prestigious magazine on Wednesday.

The wide-ranging interview is the cover story of the latest edition of the magazine, with the 46-year-old boldly declaring he was ""just born to do this"".

The Vanity Fair piece, written by Joe Hagan, seemed to echo the fawning tone of much of the media coverage that followed his failed bid to unseat Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz last fall.

Hagan, who previously penned a similarly photographed and written profile of another Democrat, former presidential candidate John Edwards, wrote in the new piece: ""For O'Rourke, what followed was a near-mystical experience,"" referring to his entry into politics.

Some of the other parts of the profile include the writer speaking to some of O'Rourke's ex-girlfriends, and one glowing piece of prose describing the Democrat as an ""endurance-athlete campaigner.""

""Former girlfriends describe O'Rourke as curious, wry, bookish but adventurous. He usually carried a novel in his pocket, whether Captain Corelli's Mandolin or The Sun Also Rises,"" the profile reads.

I think it's because he's keeping a part of it to himself.""

Reaction to the piece was divided, with some celebrating the detailed look at the Democratic darling, while others mocked it.

""My sense is that Beto O'Rourke doesn't want to be president as much as he wants to be an indie movie about a guy running for president,"" Chicago Tribune columnist Rex Huppke added.

O'Rourke announced his candidacy in a video Thursday morning, appearing alongside his wife, Amy.

""Amy and I are happy to share with you that I'm running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America,"" O'Rourke said. ""This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us. The challenges we face right now, the interconnected crises in our democracy and our climate, have never been greater.""

Republicans scoffed at his campaign launch, however, with RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens saying in a statement: ""It's telling that the Democrats' biggest star is someone whose biggest accomplishment is losing. Beto O'Rourke failed to get anything done in Congress, and with extreme policies like government-run health care and tearing down border barriers, his 2020 bid won't be successful either.""

The congressman from El Paso grabbed national attention last summer and autumn, as he challenged Republican Cruz in the 2018 midterm elections. O'Rourke raked in an eye-popping $80 million during his campaign, thanks in part to his uplifting message and his mastery of social media.

"A reader sent me this wonderful 2016 Heritage Foundation lecture by Gary Morson, who spoke of what conservatives can learn from Russian literature. Here's the summary:

American conservatives can learn much from the great literary output of 19th century Russia. Though seemingly distant in time and place, the great Russian novelists faced intellectual and moral circumstances remarkably similar to those we find today in America and in the West generally. Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov all wrote in opposition to the powerful ruling class emerging in Russia and the West, the intelligentsia. The revolutionary doctrines of the intelligentsia pointed toward authoritarianism, sought the destruction of individuality and religion, and the imposition of pseudo-scientific doctrines onto human life. The weapon of choice for Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov to combat this was literature -- the best means both to appeal to man's sentiments and reason and to demonstrate their opponents' utopianism and destructiveness.

And here are some excerpts that seemed especially relevant to things I've been thinking about lately. To start, the concept of ""the intelligentsia,"" a term that came to English from Russian:

Is life a matter of grand politics or individual souls? And can it be captured in a theory, or is there always what Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin called a ""surplus"" exceeding the grasp of any conceivable theory? The intelligentsia believed in theories and crises, the novelists in the complexities of ordinary, prosaic experience. For the novelists, people were not just abstractions or units to be sacrificed in the name of a theory that promised perfection, and they thought that the intelligentsia had far too much confidence -- much more than experience could warrant -- that their theories were correct and would have the desired effect.

In short, the intelligentsia was ready to sacrifice or enslave individuals, who did not really matter, to achieve utopia. Alexievich refers to such overconfident people as ""slavery romantics, slaves of utopia.""

Alexievich quotes Varlam Shalamov, the Gulag's second most famous chronicler, who declared: ""I was a participant in a colossal battle, a battle that was lost, for the genuine renewal of humanity."" Alexievich then continues:

[And] I reconstruct the history of that battle, its victories and its defeats. The history of how people wanted to build the Heavenly Kingdom on earth. Paradise. The City of the Sun. In the end, all that remained was a sea of blood, millions of ruined lives. There was a time, however, when no political idea of the 20th century was comparable to communism (or the October Revolution as its symbol), a time when nothing attracted Western intellectuals and people all around the world more powerfully and emotionally. Raymond Aron called the Russian Revolution the ""opium of the intellectuals.""

Today that opium calls itself ""social justice."" This phrase has become a magic word, so that instead of arguing for a specific change by assessing costs, benefits, likeliness of success, and possibility of unintended consequences, one just uses the term ""social justice."" One then treats all opponents as enemies of justice, the way Marxists treated their opponents. The possibility that people with other views may believe in justice just as sincerely but have different conceptions of what justice is -- and the possibility that even opponents who do share the same conception of justice may have different ideas on how best to achieve it -- such possibilities are not even imagined or are dismissed out of hand.

I always thought that the ""intelligentsia"" mean educated people. Not to the classic Russian novelists it doesn't. Morson says that being one of the intelligentsia required these things:

Because of these criteria, none of the classic Russian literary geniuses were proper members of the intelligentsia. Not Dostoevsky, not Tolstoy, not Chekhov.

The intelligentsia, in the Russian conception, believe themselves to be the saviors of mankind, and extend their ideology to all of life. So, writes Morson:

To the extent that a group of intellectuals comes to resemble an intelligentsia, to that extent is totalitarianism on the horizon should that group gain power. I anticipate the real possibility that in the near future, we may live under a Putin-style managed democracy, and not some sort of Swedish-style social democracy, that could soon after morph into a Stalinist state. Or rather, one beyond Stalinism, since Stalin did not have access to today's monitoring technology. That would make 1984 a libertarian paradise.

Yes! This is what my next book is going to be about -- the warning that those who grew up under the communist dystopia created by the intelligentsia are giving us, and strategies for how to resist it! More Morson:

So far as I know, the only 19th century thinker to foresee totalitarianism was Dostoevsky. The reason he could, I think, is that he deeply understood the mentality of the intelligentsia and what it would do with power. Unlike Tolstoy, he had been a radical intelligent and recognized what he himself might have been willing to do. In one article, he refuted the idea, common among conservatives, that young radicals are simply ""idle and undeveloped"" people, as one journal put it. On the contrary, Dostoevsky declares:

I am myself an old Nechaevist, I myself stood on the scaffold condemned to death, and I assure you that I stood in the company of educated people.... And therein lies the real horror: that in Russia one can commit the foulest and most villainous act without being in the least a villain.... The possibility of considering oneself -- and sometimes even being, in fact -- an honorable person while committing obvious and undeniable villainy -- that is our whole affliction!

And, I might add, it is ours today.

I recall the very moment that I began turning slowly but definitely away from the left. It was the morning of October 8, 1985. As I ate breakfast in my apartment and prepared to go work the left-wing student activist table at college, I turned on the TV news, and saw that Palestinian terrorists had shot and killed Leon Klinghoffer, an elderly American wheelchair-bound Jew, and dumped his body into the Mediterranean from the cruise ship they had commandeered. I was outraged by this act of cruelty, and couldn't get it off my mind. When I arrived at the table, I told the two older students already there how upset I was by the fate of Klinghoffer.

The tall guy got angry, and said, ""You always hear about Palestinian terrorism. How come you never hear about Israeli terrorism?"" He went on like that for a minute or two.

Then the short guy, a Puerto Rican with thick glasses that made him look like an owl, said gently, ""Well, if he was rich enough to go on the cruise, then he deserved what he got.""

That was it for me and the progressive students. I have to be grateful to them for showing me their cards so early in my involvement with them. I was a naive freshman, but a little less naive after that morning.

Whenever I see the SJWs on campus today, I think of those two fanatical intelligentsia at the table that morning, happy to see an elderly American Jew in a wheelchair shot in the head and dumped overboard, in the first guy's case because Klinghoffer was a Jew (and that meant tied to Israel), in the second guy's case because Klinghoffer was rich.

I met a young academic on my travels last weekend, a man who has spent almost half his life studying in a particular field. He told me that it has become so woke that he fears for his career. He is a white male, which means he has a target on his back. He told me specifics of something that just happened in his department -- I won't reveal it here, to protect his privacy -- as a result of an event that made national news. What happened is extremely unjust and destructive by any normal person's reckoning, but of course this is a matter of ""social justice,"" so all is permitted. That kind of thing reminded me of these bits from Morson's talk:

Chekhov particularly hated this ""artificial, overwrought solidarity,"" as he called it, because it entailed not thinking but repeating orthodoxies.

And this quote from Solzhenitsyn:

Ideology -- that is what gives...the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others' eyes, so that he won't hear reproaches and curses and will receive praises and honors.

My book will be about how to fight this ideology here and now. The trick is not just to fight it openly, but more importantly, not to let it creep into your heart, your mind, your soul.",336,The American Conservative,"Our Teachers, The Russian Novelists"
"Former U.S. Sen. Birch Bayh, who championed the federal law banning discrimination against women in college admissions and sports, has died. He was 91.

Bayh died early Thursday surrounded by his family at his home in Easton, Maryland, according to a statement released by his family. His son, Evan, followed him into politics and became Indiana's governor and also a senator.

Birch Bayh, a liberal Democrat, had a back-slapping, humorous campaigning style that helped him win three narrow elections to the Senate starting in 1962 at a time when Republicans won Indiana in four of the five presidential elections. Bayh's hold on the seat ended with a loss to Dan Quayle during the 1980 Ronald Reagan-led Republican landslide.

Bayh was the lead sponsor of the landmark 1972 law prohibiting gender discrimination in education -- known as Title IX for its section in the Higher Education Act.

DEVOS TO ROLL BACK OBAMA-ERA TITLE IX REGULATIONS DEEMED UNFAIR TO THE 'ACCUSED'

The law's passage came at a time when women earned fewer than 10 percent of all medical and law degrees and fewer than 300,000 high school girls -- one in 27 -- played sports.

Bayh said the law was aimed at giving women a better shot at higher-paying jobs. He continued speaking in support of Title IX's enforcement for years after leaving Congress.

""It was clear that the greatest danger or damage being done to women was the inequality of higher education,"" Bayh said in a 2012 interview. ""If you give a person an education, whether it's a boy or girl, young woman or young man, they will have the tools necessary to make a life for families and themselves.""

Now, women make up more than half of those receiving bachelor's and graduate degrees, and more than 3 million high school girls -- one in two -- play sports.

As the Title IX law reached its 40th anniversary, North Carolina State athletic director Debbie Yow called it one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation in the country's history.

""Had it not passed, the options and opportunities for women in this country and the world would be vastly different."" Yow said.

Bayh used his position as head of the Senate's constitutional subcommittee to craft the 25th Amendment on presidential succession and the 26th Amendment setting the national voting age at 18.

EDUCATION DEPARTMENT UNVEILS NEW TITLE IX GUIDANCE FOR CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT: HERE'S WHAT WOULD CHANGE

The issue of presidential succession was fresh when Congress approved the amendment in 1967. The vice presidency had been vacant for more than a year after President John F. Kennedy's assassination because there was no provision for filling the office between elections.

The amendment led to the presidency of Gerald Ford less than a decade later when Ford first succeeded Spiro Agnew as vice president and then took over the White House after President Richard Nixon's resignation during the Watergate scandal.

Bayh's push to lower the national voting age from 21 to 18 came amid protests over the Vietnam War and objections that Americans dying on battlefields were unable to vote in all states. The amendment won ratification from the states in 1971.

Bayh also was a leading sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have barred discrimination on the basis of gender. It passed Congress but failed to win approval from two-thirds of the states by its 1982 deadline.

Bayh had begun preparing to make a run for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination when his wife, Marvella, was diagnosed with breast cancer. He dropped that campaign but entered the 1976 presidential campaign, finishing second to Jimmy Carter in the opening Iowa caucuses but then faring poorly in later primaries.

Marvella Bayh gained attention by speaking and making television appearances around the country promoting cancer detection and encouraging research. But her cancer later returned, and she died in April 1979 at age 46 -- shortly before her memoir recounting her health fight was published.

Bayh sought a fourth Senate term the following year -- with 24-year-old son Evan as campaign manager -- but lost to Quayle, then a two-term congressman.

Born Jan. 22, 1928, in Terre Haute, Ind., Birch Evans Bayh Jr. moved to his maternal grandparents' farm at the nearby community of Shirkieville after his mother's 1940 death and his father's entry into World War II military service.

He graduated from Purdue University's School of Agriculture after spending two years in the Army and met his future wife during a 1951 National Farm Bureau speaking contest in Chicago, which she won as an entrant from Oklahoma. They soon married and moved to the Shirkieville farm.

Bayh won his first election to the state Legislature in 1954; his son Evan was born the following year. Bayh rose quickly in politics, becoming the Indiana House speaker in 1959 at the age of 30. He earned a law degree from Indiana University, completing law school while serving in the Legislature.

Bayh entered the 1962 Senate race, taking on three-term Republican Sen. Homer Capehart. Bayh boosted his name recognition -- and correct pronunciation -- around the state with a catchy campaign song opening with the lines ""Hey look him over, he's my kind of guy. His first name is Birch, his last name is Bayh.""

Bayh was 34 when elected to the Senate and soon became friends with the only senator younger than him -- Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy. Bayh and his wife were flying with Kennedy when their small plane crashed near Springfield, Mass., in June 1964. The pilot and a legislative aide were killed, but Bayh pulled Kennedy, who suffered a broken back and other serious injuries, from the wreckage.

After leaving the Senate, Bayh worked as a lawyer and lobbyist in Washington. He remarried in 1982, and he and wife Katherine Helpin had a son, Christopher, who is now a lawyer in Washington.

Bayh largely stayed in the background of Indiana politics as his older son, Evan, was elected to the first of his two terms as governor in 1988. The younger Bayh built a more moderate image than his father, ending his eight years as governor with a high approval rating and then winning his first of two elections to the Senate in 1998. He didn't seek a third term in 2010, saying the Senate had become too partisan.

The elder Bayh seemed to revel in the change brought about from the Title IX law, describing it as the most important legal step for equality since the right of women to vote was guaranteed by the 19th Amendment in 1920.

""There was a soccer field I used to jog around,"" he said. ""One day, all of a sudden, I realized that half of the players were little girls and half of them were little boys. I realized then that that was, in part, because of Title IX.""",337,Fox News,"Sen. Birch Bayh, author of Title IX law, dies at age 91"
"In an interview on the ""Today"" show, Ex-'Tonight Show' host Jay Leno says late-night politics have become 'too political' and comics today have a tough job working with it as the 'only topic out there.'

The commander-in-chief has turned TV critic-in-chief once again.

President Trump fired off the latest salvo in his long-running late-night war on Thursday morning, attacking 'the three very and untalented' late-night hosts.

It is assumed the president was referring to Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, who both mocked him on their shows Wednesday night, and Jimmy Fallon.

KIMMEL FIRES BACK AFTER TRUMP CALLS LATE-NIGHT SHOWS 'ONE-SIDED': 'STOP BEING TERRIBLE AND WE'LL STOP POINTING IT OUT'

One day earlier, the president slammed the ""very boring"" shows by picking up on comments made by former ""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno, who bemoaned how political the genre has become.

""The one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me, unwatchable. But remember, WE are number one - President!"" Trump tweeted.

Earlier in the day, Leno told ""Today"" show co-host Al Roker if he misses his former gig, to which the 68-year-old emphatically replied, ""no.""

""I don't miss it. You know, everything now... everyone has to know your politics,"" Leno said. ""I tried to use Johnny's model, and I would get hate mail from both sides equally and thought 'well that's fabulous, that's exactly what I want'.""

""But when people see you as one-sided, it makes it tough. And, you know, I did it when Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb, and it was just a little easier.""

He added: ""Now it's all very serious, I'd just like to see a bit of civility come back to it.""

The president's Thursday morning tweet came after Kimmel branded him a ""snowflake"" on Wednesday night.

Kimmel showed a clip from Leno's appearance on the ""Today"" show, before adding: ""He's right. It's harder now because Trump is dumb and horny at the same time.""

STEPHEN COLBERT MOCKS TRUMP'S CPAC SPEECH: HE WAS 'DRY-HUMPING OLD GLORY'

Kimmel then told the audience that he actually doesn't want to talk about the president in his monologue.

""None of us do,"" Kimmel added. ""None of us who hosts these shows do, but he gives us no choice. If he sat in the White House all day quietly working on things, I would almost never mention him because he's not interesting. But not even today -- before 10 a.m. today, before ten o'clock this morning, his former campaign chairman was sentenced to prison for the second time in a week, he called himself the 'most successful president in history,' and he tweeted to let people know his wife hasn't been replaced with a body double.

"Yaakov Peri, the former head of the Israeli security agency Shin Bet and Rep. Ilhan Omar (Yaakov P)

Freshman Democratic representative Ilhan Omar has come under fire in recent weeks following a flurry of online comments widely deemed anti-Semitic by lawmakers, politicians and Americans alike.

While some top Democrats were quick to condemn her comments and Israel criticism, others have failed to rebuke her slurs - prompting at least one former Israeli security and intelligence chief to question the direction of the Democratic party and its tolerance of the Congressional newcomer from Minnesota's unchartered turmoil.

""It is something that I am concerned about, listening to such voices and leaders of the Democratic party not condemning them is a concern to Israel, and to every freedom and liberal human being,"" Yaakov Peri, 74, the former head of the Israeli security agency Shin Bet and later the Minister of Science & Technology, told Fox News. ""These kinds of voices were never heard in the American administrations and it is something that I am concerned about.""

In his view, Omar's criticism of Israel, its lobbying efforts and finances - followed by only some denunciation from some Democrats - is, in large part, an attempt to hit back at President Trump.

""It is (coming from) internal American politics,"" Peri believes. ""As Mr. Trump is one of the biggest supporters of Israel, it is a way of dealing with him.

""Unfortunately, doing it in an anti-Semitic way is not acceptable.""

Even though relations between Israel and the United States leadership are strong, Peri expressed concern that it is still ""very fragile, very elastic, and unstable"". Israel has its own elections next month and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces indictment on bribery and corruption charges.

KARL ROVE: DEMOCRATS DOWNPLAY ILHAN OMAR'S ANTI-SEMITISM AND WILL RUE THE DAY THEY DID SO

All the while, Israel's internal security is still rife with problems on multiple frontiers.

The former security commander has been busily crafting a ""New State Solution,"" a new Middle East peace initiative that would ultimately entail leasing land from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula in an effort to solve the seemingly intractable Palestinian problem.

""The fact is that all negotiations between Israel and Palestine have failed. We have to come up with new, creative ideas,"" Peri explained. ""First of all, this gives an immediate solution for a very difficult humanitarian situation. The Gaza Strip is on the edge of a humanitarian crisis, one of the worst times it has ever been.""

Focusing first and foremost on the overcrowded Gaza Strip, the ""New State Solution"" not only involves the territorial expansion of Gaza into the Sinai, but empowers the government of the ""New State"" to declare its own capital, its own commercial airport, and economic trade, as well as giving the Palestinian state the ability to defend itself, by itself.

Beyond that, the intelligence top-brass said that they are fighting - or closely watching - threats from the likes of Lebanon's Hezbollah, Syria, Iran - and, despite almost being squeezed from all its territorial control in the region, ISIS

"Pence to senators: Set politics aside and stand with the president on border security

Vice President Pence, in an exclusive ""Fox & Friends"" interview Thursday, said Joe Biden ""caved to liberal activists"" when the former vice president backtracked after calling Pence a ""decent guy.""

Pence was asked about Biden's comments, and then his apparent backtrack, after liberal and far-left Democrats shamed him for defending Pence's character. He also weighed in on Biden potentially entering the 2020 presidential race.

""Well look, they've got an awfully big field,"" Pence told ""Fox & Friends."" ""On the other side, the reality that you see -- on the Democrat side, is it's largely being driven by the most extreme liberal elements in their party, and the way Joe Biden caved in to liberal activists after making a kind comment for me is evidence of the pressure that all of their candidates are going to face.""

Biden's comment came last month, when he defended Pence for praising President Trump during the Munich Security Conference. Pence was met with stone-cold silence.

""The fact of the matter is, it was followed on by a guy who's a decent guy, our vice president, who stood before this group of allies and leaders and said, 'I'm here on behalf of President Trump,' and there was dead silence. Dead silence,"" Biden said during a speech in Nebraska.

But Biden was hit with intense criticism by liberals like former New York City gubernatorial candidate and ""Sex and the City"" actress Cynthia Nixon, who blasted Biden for calling ""America's most anti-LGBT elected leader 'a decent guy.'""

""Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community,"" Nixon tweeted.

Biden took a step back and said: ""You're right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on a world stage. But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.""

Meanwhile, during the interview, Pence explained that Democrats are ""prepared to run on open borders, socialism, abortion on demand infanticide, 'Medicare-or-all,' and The Green New Deal,"" giving an optimistic forecast for Republicans come the next election cycle.

""And -- I like our chances in 2020,"" Pence said.

At this point, there are more than a dozen Democrats who have announced they will run for president, with another dozen rumored or considering a White House bid.

Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., are among the already-crowded field.

Meanwhile, Biden hinted at a 2020 announcement ""in a few weeks"" on Tuesday during a speech at the annual convention of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) union.

""I appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here,"" Biden said. ""Save it a little longer. I may need it in a few weeks.""

Biden was met with applause and a standing ovation from the audience, but joked: ""Be careful what you wish for. Be careful what you wish for.""

Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate for nearly four decades before joining the Obama administration as vice president, has been moving closer and closer in recent weeks to launching, what could be, his third White House bid.

Sources familiar with his planning told Fox News last week that top advisers to the former vice president are getting their ducks in a row, figuring out a campaign structure and reaching out to veteran Democratic operatives who would be involved. Those sources suggested a campaign launch come April.",341,Fox News,Pence says Joe Biden 'caved' to liberals in pulling back from 'decent guy' comment

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is 'not worth' risk of impeachment; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill.

On the weekend the Academy Awards were handed out, I was in a restaurant in Los Angeles when two Oscar nominees walked in. What most shocked me was the complete lack of reaction by anyone in the room.

No one stared or even pointed. No one congratulated them. Diners not caught up in conversation had their eyes fixed on the TV in the bar, where people on a cable news show were discussing the upcoming summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The folks in the restaurant found Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., more interesting to watch on TV than the stars who had just entered the room.

BETO O'ROURKE SAYS HE'S 'BORN' TO FIGHT AHEAD OF EXPECTED 2020 ANNOUNCEMENT

This underscored something I've thought for a long time: Politics has become our national entertainment - and entertainment just doesn't matter anymore.

At one time films, music and TV bound us together as a people. They collectively reminded us of who we were and where we were going.

Whether it was ""The Carol Burnett Show,"" ""The Tonight Show,"" ""All in the Family,"" ""The Jeffersons,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" or ""Dallas,"" Americans at one time watched the same shows at the same time, and we were better for it.

There were fixed cultural reference points - places we could go across generations for laughter, understanding and - if not agreement - unity.

With the onslaught of streaming services and niche programming today, one could make the argument that there is no mass pop culture. We are a series of isolated viewers enjoying our own entertainment options. But the communal experience is all but gone.

Today we are all focused on the one thing that can only drive us further apart: politics. It has infected all aspects of American life and has become its own alternative entertainment.

Americans tune in day and night to the soap opera that has become their government. It's a blood-sport challenge for power that plays out in real time on our screens.

For the most part it is now ""Hunger Games."" And however detestable the spectacle, we all watch. This gives us something in common to discuss the next day at work.

Last weekend's South by Southwest gathering furnished more evidence of the cultural shift. What was once a festival dedicated to technology and film has become a showcase for ambitious politicians.

Democratic presidential hopefuls showing up included Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar Minnesota; unsuccessful Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke of Texas; and socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York (not running for president because she is too young).

Attendees filled the meeting halls to see the Democratic politicians. Axios reports that at one party Hollywood stars were ignored while partygoers flocked around Ocasio-Cortez. This is entirely the fault of the artists themselves and those who produce entertainment.

By injecting politics into their offerings, Hollywood creatives and too many artists have ceded their rightful place in American culture. Their job is not to bully audiences into adopting positions they hold, or to convince us to vote for their candidate, but to entertain and enlighten.

Art can do what no politician can: it reminds us that we are human and how similar we are despite our differences. But after years of politically divisive offerings, audiences have drifted away.

The ratings for the Oscars, the Grammys, the Tonys and the Emmys have cratered for the most part year after year. And 2018 was the lowest-rated Academy Awards show in history. The stars are smaller than ever and so are their vehicles.

If artists don't rediscover their true purpose in American life and stop playing pundits or politicians, they can expect to be further culturally supplanted by the real thing.

"Trump tells Republicans planning to vote against his national emergency declaration 'use your own discretion'

President Trump and Senate Republicans are bracing for an intra-party showdown Thursday as lawmakers are likely to block President Trump's border emergency declaration, likely forcing the president to use his veto powers for the first time.

The declaration was an effort by Trump to steer extra $3.6 billion to build the border wall.

TRUMP SCUTTLES DEAL THAT WOULD AVOID SENATE REBUKE

Due to the small Republican majority in the Senate-- 53-47-- it takes only four Republicans to vote in favor of the bill to block the declaration. Behind the scenes, Trump invited to some Senate Republicans to the White House on Wednesday to talk about trade, but the conversation quickly turned towards their supposed vote against the president.

""He would like for us to vote against the [resolution]. But he understands and respects that senators may have different opinions,"" Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who reportedly hasn't yet decided how he will vote on the resolution, told Politico. ""There's a border crisis and we have to deal with it. But I still have my constitutional concern.""

""He said that he wanted us to vote with him but understood if we didn't,"" another Republican senator told the outlet.

PENCE URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION: IT'S 'WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT'

Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, urged Republicans to support the national emergency declaration in an interview set to air on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday morning.

""A vote against the president's national emergency declaration is a vote to deny the humanitarian and security crisis that's happening at our southern border. So we're urging every member of the Senate set politics aside to recognize that we have a crisis,"" he told ""Fox & Friends'"" Pete Hegseth.

Yet the passage of the anti-Trump resolution was effectively secured on Wednesday after the talks between the senators and the White House collapsed on Wednesday following a failure to reach a compromise on distinct legislation that would limit presidents' powers to declare emergencies in the future.

Some Senators reportedly expressed willingness to back Trump's declaration and please their constituents in the exchange of the measure curbing the expansion of presidential authority, a bill spearheaded by Utah Sen. Mike Lee.

Lee later issued a statement affirming his vote for the resolution that blocks Trump's emergency declaration. ""Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch,"" he said.

If former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is being held accountable for the laws he has broken, he's got plenty of company in Washington, D.C., Real Clear Politics founder Tom Bevan argued Wednesday evening.

Manafort is now facing more than seven years in prison for crimes he committed before joining Donald Trump's presidential campaign as well as for crimes he committed during the Russia investigation. His legal troubles are far from over as he has now been indicted on an additional 16 counts in New York state.

During Thursday's ""Special Report"" All-Star panel, Bevan -- along with national security analyst Morgan Ortagus and Georgetown Institute of Politic executive director Mo Elleithee -- weighed in on the Manafort sentencing as well as the latest developments from former FBI lawyer Lisa Page's congressional testimony.

Bevan began by making it clear that ""nobody is going to shed a tear"" for a ""corrupt guy"" like Manafort. That being said, he insisted that if Manafort was being punished for his crimes, then plenty of others should be as well.

""If the standard is now, 'We're going to prosecute for FERA violations and we're going to drain the swamp,' let's do it because there are another fifty or a hundred Paul Manaforts doing the exact same thing. So if that's the standard, let's go ahead and drain the swamp,"" Bevan told the panel.

Elleithee warned about the consequences of President Trump possibly pardoning Manafort, saying that at minimum the ""optics look bad"" and noting that Trump cannot shield Manafort from the state-level charges against him.

Meanwhile, Ortagus noted Lisa Page's significant role in revealing what happened in the Department of Justice during its handling of the Clinton email investigation as well as the early stages of the Russia probe. Testimony shared by the House Judiciary Committee shows that Page confirmed to lawmakers that the Justice Department instructed the FBI not to pursue charges of ""gross negligence"" against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

""When the story, the history is written about all of this, Lisa Page is going to be such a fascinating and integral character in this,"" Ortagus said. ""I mean, look at all the number of people -- Comey, McCabe, Strzok -- all of these people she's given congressional testimony to counter them, to contradict them and they are all in trouble, multiple times over. ... So pay attention to Lisa Page. She's taking down some of the biggest names in the FBI.""",345,Fox News,"If Manafort must be punished, then 'drain the swamp' of all the other Manaforts in DC: Tom Bevan"
"They are using words he uttered on a shock-jock radio show as long as 13 years ago, even though for part of that time he worked as an MSNBC host.

The effort is led by a liberal advocacy organization that has been crusading against Fox News for years.

There is a push to get advertisers to boycott his prime-time show in an effort to force him off the air.

These things are also true about Tucker Carlson:

Some of the things he said on the radio show are offensive, troubling and can't be defended. His characterizations, especially of women and Muslims, were totally unacceptable.

Yes, he seemingly made the comments in jocular banter long ago, but in today's Twitter-driven environment, old remarks are an increasingly common weapon against public figures.

He has gone on offense rather than apologize, unlike what many media figures have done to make amends.

Carlson regularly called in to the Tampa-based ""Bubba the Love Sponge"" show between 2006 and 2011. He hosted the MSNBC show ""Tucker"" for the first half of that period, when most of the inflammatory remarks were made, and was a Fox News contributor toward the end of that period. MSNBC declined to comment.

The audio and transcripts were released by Media Matters, a liberal group that goes after media conservatives in general and Fox in particular. (There are similar organizations on the right).

In the first batch of recordings, Carlson said: ""I love women, but they're extremely primitive, they're basic, they're not that hard to understand.""

He described Elena Kagan as unattractive, called Arianna Huffington a pig, and used the C-word in discussing television host Alexis Stewart, the daughter of Martha Stewart.

There were also exchanges about Warren Jeffs, former head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, now serving a life sentence for child rape.

While Jeffs ""may"" be ""a child rapist,"" Carlson said, ""I'm just telling you that arranging a marriage between a 16-year-old and a 27-year-old is not the same as pulling a stranger off the street and raping her."" He said on the show three years later that he was not defending underage marriage, but ""I just don't think it's the same thing exactly as pulling a child from a bus stop and sexually assaulting that child.""

In a second batch of recordings, released live on MSNBC during an interview with Media Matters President Angelo Carusone, Carlson used awful language in describing why he opposed the Iraq war.

Iraq is a ""crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semiliterate primitive monkeys,"" he said. On another show, he said he had no sympathy for Iraqis or their culture because they ""don't use toilet paper or forks.""

In a 2006 appearance, Carlson said he'd like to see a presidential candidate blame ""lunatic Muslims who are behaving like animals,"" and that such a candidate would be elected king by vowing to ""kill as many of them"" as possible.

Carlson also repeated a gay slur used by Bubba as they joked about having a sexual attraction to each other. And in a third batch, Carlson called the winner of the Miss Teen USA pageant ""so dumb"" and speculated she was having sex with a prominent actor.

As I said, I can't defend any of these comments.

Carlson's response was to blame ""the great American outrage machine."" And Fox News, rather than making a statement, is referring reporters to Carlson's rebuttal.

He told viewers Monday that ""it's pointless to try to explain how the words were spoken in jest or taken out of context, or in any case bear no resemblance to what you actually think or would want for the country. None of that matters, nobody cares. You know the role you're required to play. You are a sinner that needs the forgiveness of Twitter.""

Even if he apologized profusely and issued a statement of deep contrition, Carlson said, it would simply provide a pretext for critics to attack him again.

He said these critics believe ""that politics is war"" and will do whatever it takes to gain power. ""If that includes getting you fired or silencing you, or threatening your family at home, or throwing you in prison, okay. They know what their goal is. If you are in the way, they will crush you.""

He added that ""we've always apologized when we are wrong,"" but ""will never bow to the mob.""

From Carlson's vantage point, he made the most criticized comments as an MSNBC host on Bubba's popular radio show on Sirius XM, it was never hidden, but no one brought it up until he had a top-rated show on Fox.

As if to underscore the guerilla warfare involved, the Daily Caller, the conservative site co-founded by Carlson, has struck back by unearthing incendiary comments from that period by Carusone, the Media Matters chief.

In a 2005 post about a Bangladeshi man robbed by transvestites, Carusone asked whether the writer was a ""tranny lover"" and said the police should advise the public to ""stay away from tranny bars."" He said ""lighten up Japs"" after a Japanese basketball coach was accused of hitting female players and making them run nude. Carusone also said of his boyfriend, ""despite his jewry, you KNOW he's adorable.""

Compare the media pillorying of Carlson with the way that liberal MSNBC host Joy Reid was treated last year after Mediaite obtained numerous homophobic posts she had written a decade earlier.

Among other things, Reid wrote that ""most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing"" and that ""a lot of heterosexuals, especially men, find the idea of homosexual sex to be ... well ... gross.""

After an initial apology for some earlier posts, Reid blamed unspecified hackers -- an explanation she soon dropped -- for ""an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.""

But then still more posts surfaced, including her promotion of a theory that the U.S. government was behind 9/11. She also Photoshopped John McCain's head onto the body of Seung-Hui Cho, who murdered 32 people in a mass shooting at Virginia Tech.

Reid apologized again, saying ""there are things I deeply regret and am embarrassed by"" and that her position on some issues had changed. MSNBC called the remarks ""obviously hateful and hurtful,"" but said they were ""not reflective of the colleague and friend we have known at MSNBC for the past seven years.""

But there was no huge media uproar over Reid's past anti-gay rhetoric. To be sure, Carlson is more famous and has one of the biggest audiences in cable news. And yet the reaction follows a pattern: the mainstream press and liberal commentators seizing on controversies involving media conservatives, while those on the right doing the same when someone on the left is targeted but not achieving the same noise level.

Six years ago it took days for MSNBC host Martin Bashir to resign after saying Sarah Palin should be forced to endure the treatment of slaves -- including having someone defecate in her mouth -- and that drew a small fraction of the coverage now surrounding Carlson.

Kathleen Parker, a moderately conservative Washington Post columnist, wrote that while she finds his past language ""abominable ... neither Carlson nor anyone should instinctively bow to the mob ... Let them rage their furies, but once we allow a self-selected subset of American liberalism to become arbiters of what constitutes acceptable thought, then we are, indeed, on the road to purgatory.""

"FILE: Jan. 19, 2017: President Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and husband George Conway, Union Station, Washington, D.C. (Associated Press)

The husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway blasted President Trump on Wednesday, claiming Trump has a problem with ""pathological"" lying.

George Conway, an attorney who has become an outspoken critic of the president via Twitter messages, posted a thread that began when he called out Trump for claiming that Judge Amy Berman Jackson's sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort earlier in the day had exonerated the president from the Russian collusion narrative.

""Have we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life?"" Conway asked in a tweet. ""One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off. But instead he lies about it. He denies what the world can see on videotape. Even his donors and supporters wonder, what is wrong with him? Why would he feel compelled to tell such an absurd lie?""

GEORGE CONWAY RAMPS UP TRUMP ATTACKS AS KELLYANNE DEFENDS BOSS

Conway then invoked Trump's recent meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, whom the president referred to as ""Tim Apple."" Trump reportedly later told RNC donors that he had really said ""Tim Cook Apple,"" uttering Cook's last name softly, but then reversed course on Twitter when he claimed he called the CEO ""Tim Apple"" to ""save time and words.""

Conway also mocked the president's two-hour-long CPAC speech, which he called ""incoherent.""

""The judge says, in open court, that Manafort's lawyers' 'no collusion' 'mantra' was patently ridiculous because it was irrelevant to the charges at hand- not that there was no proof of collusion, just that whether there was or wasn't was irrelevant to the proceedings at hand,"" Conway wrote. ""And yet he lies again - a blatant lie - about what the judge said in open court.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Conway later suggested that the president has a ""disorder"" and that an inquiry needs to be made regarding his ""condition of mind.""

""It's not rational, because it's a lie that no reasonable person would believe. It undermines his credibility. It's self-defeating. But these are just two of... how many examples? Hundreds? Thousands? Is it possible to count?"" he asked. ""At any level of government in this country, in any party, have we ever seen anything like this? It's beyond politics. It's nuts. It's a disorder. Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man's condition of mind.""

Instances of the president or members of the Trump family publicly criticizing George Conway have been relatively rare. But one sharply worded Twitter message came in December from Eric Trump.

""Of all the ugliness in politics, the utter disrespect George Conway shows toward his wife, her career, place of work, and everything she has fought SO hard to achieve, might top them all,"" Eric Trump wrote. ""@KellyannePolls is great person and frankly his actions are horrible.""",347,Fox News,"Kellyanne Conway's husband rips Trump for 'pathological' lying, claims president has 'disorder'"
"Vice President Pence: Stand with the president and stand for border security

Vice President Mike Pence urged Republicans on Capitol Hill to back President Trump's national emergency declaration at the southern border during an interview set to air on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday morning.

There is has been recent chatter that there could be enough Senate Republican opposition to nix the measure, which was passed as part of a Trump strategy to fund his long-promised border wall. That, in turn, could lead to President Trump's first veto in office.

For his part, Pence hopes it won't come to a veto, and that Republicans will back the president.

"""Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party,"" Trump said Tuesday, quoting Pipko who made the same declaration on Fox and Friends.

Trump reportedly told a room full of Republican donors on Friday night that ""the Democrats hate Jewish people.""

Trump told donors that ""he didn't understand how any Jew could vote for a Democrat these days,"" according to the Axios news site, which cited three people at the off-record event.

Jewish Democrats criticized Trump for his claims of antisemitism within their party.

""President Trump is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts. In this case, both are just WRONG,"" the Jewish Democratic Council of America posted on Facebook. ""In the midterm elections 82% of the two-party Jewish vote went to Democrats. 32/34 Jewish members of Congress are Democrats. As of early October, 70% Jewish voters disapproved of Trump's handling of the rise of anti-Semitism in our country. Those are FACTS.""

As the Times of Israel noted, the data cited came from a survey conducted by the Mellman Group, a polling firm hired by Democrats.

Last month, Trump called on Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign from her post on the Foreign Affairs Committee over her suggestion that Jewish money was behind support for Israel.

On Tuesday, the Jewish Democratic Council of America posted on Facebook poll data showing a decline in the Jewish vote for Republicans in the last two presidential elections.

""President Trump - Let's get the facts straight,"" the JDCA posted. ""Republicans have lost support among Jewish voters since you've been in office.""

Pipko, who was a 2016 Trump campaign staffer and whose husband Darren Centinello is a staffer on the 2020 campaign, got married last year at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.

""We invited the President but, unfortunately, it was just before the federal shutdown began,"" she told the New York Post. ""Our invitations were red hats that read 'Make Marriage Great Again,' with a tag hanging off that listed all the wedding information.""

She said she had originally kept her background as a Trump campaign staffer a secret out of concern that it would harm her modelling career.

Pipko told SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight that Jexodus is a ""grassroots movement started by young millennials who are just trying to galvanize young Jews across the country and get them involved in what's happening in politics.""

She added that the initiative also hopes to create a safe space where ""young Jews can feel unafraid [and] stand up for themselves and their beliefs.""",349,Breitbart,Trump Echoes Jexodus: 'Jewish People are Leaving the Democratic Party'
"WELLINGTON, New Zealand - A New Zealand government minister said he was punched in the face Thursday while walking to work in an attack that's rare in a country where politicians often mingle with the public in stores, bars and sports arenas.

James Shaw, the Climate Change Minister and co-leader of the Green Party, was walking past Wellington's Botanic Garden just before 8 a.m. when a man started talking to him before grabbing him and punching him several times, said Shaw's press secretary, Peter Stevens.

Stevens said two people came along to help and the man jumped in a car and drove away. Shaw suffered a black eye and grazes on his wrist and was being assessed at Wellington Hospital, Stevens said.

Police said a 47-year-old man has been arrested.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she'd spoken with Shaw soon after the attack and he'd told her he was doing fine. She told him to take whatever time he needed to recover and her thoughts were with him and his wife.

""When you go into politics in New Zealand you just don't expect these things to happen, and I know it will be especially challenging for loved ones,"" Ardern said in a statement.

She said she couldn't say much more about the attack as it was the subject of a police investigation.

""We have an environment in New Zealand where politicians are accessible, and that's something we should feel proud of,"" Ardern said. ""We are, after all, here to serve people. But today's events really show we cannot take that for granted.""

New Zealand historically has had few instances of terrorism or politically motivated crimes. Among politicians, typically only the prime minister gets round-the-clock protection from the Diplomatic Protection Service, while others might get temporary protection during election campaigns or when needed.

Stevens, the press secretary, said Shaw was walking with his headphones on listening to music when the man approached. The attacker seemed to recognize Shaw, he said, but the conversation was brief and somewhat random. He said Shaw asked the man to let go of him before he was punched.

""He's feeling a bit tender and a bit shaken up,"" Stevens said.

"Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive lengthy Oval Office interview that Ryan blocked issuance of subpoenas to people he thinks should have been investigated on the political left, and now that the Republicans no longer have the majority in the House, people Trump says Ryan protected may have gotten away with whatever they did that warranted investigation.

Trump said that House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and his predecessor and fellow conservative Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wanted to be tougher with the left, but that Ryan would not let them.

""Paul Ryan wouldn't give the right to have any subpoenas,"" Trump told Breitbart News. ""Okay? Now in all fairness, Meadows and Jordan and all these guys, they wanted to go tougher, but they weren't allowed to by leadership.""

Trump's comments came in a wider part of the conversation about how the left is more ""vicious"" than the right -- and that the left in American politics plays ""cuter and tougher.""

""So here's the thing -- it's so terrible what's happening,"" Trump said when asked by Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle about how the left is fighting hard. ""You know, the left plays a tougher game, it's very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don't play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump - I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough -- until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. But the left plays it cuter and tougher. Like with all the nonsense that they do in Congress ... with all this invest[igations] -- that's all they want to do is -you know, they do things that are nasty. Republicans never played this.""

Trump's relationship with Ryan during Ryan's tenure was fraught with peril from the get-go. Ryan only hesitantly backed Trump's 2016 campaign in 2016 once Trump won the GOP nomination, but then backed off from supporting Trump after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Ryan ditched on a campaign event he had scheduled with Trump that weekend, and the following week held a conference call with House GOP members in early October 2016 in which he told members it would be acceptable to him if they abandoned the GOP nominee for president just weeks before the 2016 election.

""I am not going to defend Donald Trump -- not now, not in the future,"" Ryan said on the private call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017.

Ryan followed through on that and never campaigned with Trump. When Breitbart News published this audio in the spring of 2017, his then-spokesman Brendan Buck claimed that ""a lot has happened since then"" and argued that Ryan was working with Trump on the president's agenda in the first couple years of his administration.

With the exception of tax cuts, however, which the president led the way on, Ryan did not deliver much in the way of helping Trump achieve any of his agenda during the time Ryan served as Speaker while Trump served as president. Ryan became speaker in 2015, when then-Speaker John Boehner -- facing a revolt from within his own GOP ranks -- was forced to step aside. Others had sought the job and failed before Ryan eventually ended up running for the position.

Prior to being Speaker, Ryan was the failed 2012 vice presidential nominee for the GOP presidential ticket of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. With Ryan at his side, Romney, who has since left Massachusetts behind to move to Utah and now represents Utah in the U.S. Senate, lost the 2012 presidential election to then-President Barack Obama.

Then in early 2018, Ryan announced he would not be seeking re-election in the midterms. Critics argued that his not stepping aside hurt the GOP in the midterm elections. Now that Ryan is gone from public life, he took a sharp shot at Trump earlier this week.

""The person who defines that race is going to win the race,"" Ryan said about the 2020 presidential race at a lecture in Florida per a local news account. ""If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn't going to win it.""

Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., fired back at Ryan on Twitter earlier in the week, saying the former speaker ""failed"" in 2012, ""lied to us,"" did not deliver border wall funding he promised previously, and then went on to lose the House GOP its majority in the midterms.",351,Breitbart,Exclusive -- Trump: Paul Ryan Blocked Subpoenas of Democrats
"Lincoln, the 3-year-old Nubian goat and new mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont The Rutland Herald via AP

Lincoln, a 3-year-old goat, was elected last week as Fair Haven, Vermont's pet mayor with 13 votes, according to The Rutland Herald.

Following her swearing in ceremony Tuesday, the Nubian goat's first act in office raised some eyebrows.

Lincoln couldn't wait for a bathroom and defecated on the ground, the Burlington Free Press reported.

The police chief was reportedly quick to grab a broom and dust pan to clean up the mess before her approval rating could go down with constituents.

The goat narrowly beat out a dog named Sammie Viger, a Samoyed, who came in second with an impressive 11 votes.

A total of 53 ballots were cast and 16 animals were submitted for consideration for the highly-coveted position.

Other candidates included a cat named Sassy Towle, a dog named Stella Heibler and a gerbil named Crystal.

When not serving as mayor, Lincoln spends time at her day job: groundskeeper at her owner's home with her best friend Lucy, a fellow Nubian goat, handling the brush in the backyard.

The pet election was set up by Town Manager Joe Gunter, who told The Rutland Herald that he got the idea while reading a newspaper article about a small town in Michigan doing the same thing.

Fair Haven does not have a mayor, but Gunter viewed the exercise as a productive way to raise money for a new playground and teach kids about getting involved in local politics.

Candidates were recruited by sending flyers home with elementary school children, according to VT Digger, and $5 donations were requested to register an animal.

While the donations only totaled about $100, a far cry from the $80,000 needed for new equipment to update the playground, the town plans to continue to try and raise money through a GoFundMe page and by applying for state grants, local station WCAX reported.

Lincoln will serve for a one year term, with responsibilities including making public appearances and marching in the Memorial Day parade in a custom-made sash.",352,New York Post,Vermont town swears in goat as new mayor -- who immediately defecates
"President Trump submitted his 2020 budget last week, and, as with nearly all presidential budgets before it, two things immediately ¬≠became apparent: First, there was zero chance it would be ¬≠enacted as drafted, and, second, there was no limit to congressional hysteria and demagoguery in response.

Among the biggest sources of hysteria was the president's proposal to reduce the growth in Medicare spending by $845 billion over the next decade. Democrats immediately denounced the cuts as ""devastating"" and ""cruel."" It's only a matter of time until we see the first ad showing Trump throwing grandma and her wheelchair over a cliff.

But fact is, Trump's plan is far less radical than portrayed.

For starters, while the proposed reductions sound big, they aren't. Actually, they are far less than what is needed to bring Medicare back into balance. Over the next 10 years, Medicare is projected to spend more than $10.2 trillion, meaning the president's proposed cuts amount to less than 9 percent of the entitlement's projected expenditures.

In the typical Washington way, the cuts aren't actually cuts but rather reductions in the rate of increase. Even ¬≠after the supposed ""cuts,"" Medicare spending is projected to nearly double by 2030.

Grandma is safe, moreover, because the president's proposed cuts don't directly reduce benefits for ¬≠seniors. Instead, Trump builds on Obama-era ¬≠reductions in payments to health-care providers.

For example, $260 billion in projected savings come from ¬≠efforts to prevent hospitals from increasing reimbursement levels by buying up physician practices. The new policy would pay the same reimbursements rate ¬≠regardless of whether a patient visit took place in a hospital or a doctor's off-site office.

Another $69 billion results from changes in the way Medicare ¬≠reimburses for prescription drugs. Yes, those changes mean some ¬≠seniors could face higher copayments. But at the same time, ¬≠seniors with very high drug costs would actually end up paying less. One can argue about whether this is the best way to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, but it is clearly a goal that Democrats share. Or used to.

Then, too, President Barack Obama implemented some $714 billion in similar reimbursement reductions to help fund ObamaCare. Mitt Romney famously attacked Obama for those cuts during the 2012 presidential debates. And Obama defended himself by claiming that cutting provider payments wasn't the same as cutting benefits to seniors. Those changes don't reduce benefits to seniors ""by a single dime,"" Obama passionately declared.

Bipartisan hypocrisy aside, ¬≠reductions in provider payments aren't without consequences. If payments drop too low, physicians could be discouraged from providing care or accepting Medicare patients at all. Still, that seems like a strange complaint from Democrats, many of whom have ¬≠embraced a Medicare-for-All plan that the Mercatus Center estimates would require as much as a 40 percent cut in ¬≠reimbursement rates.

Most important, Medicare desperately needs to be ¬≠reformed.

In the coming decades, the program will spend trillions of dollars more in benefits than it takes in through taxes. A married couple that earns $110,000 in wages will pay roughly $140,000 in Medicare taxes and premiums over their lifetime. That same couple can expect to receive more than $422,000 in benefits. That's not exactly a recipe for fiscal stability.

Our national debt currently exceeds $22 trillion. The president's budget expects it to top $31 trillion in a decade. Simply put, there is no way to balance the budget and reduce our debt without reforming the three big entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which account for half of all federal spending.

It is perfectly reasonable to question how the president would reform Medicare, but in that case critics have an obligation to explain how they would protect our children and grandchildren from this growing tsunami of red ink.

There are plenty of reasons to criticize the president's budget. It doesn't even try to balance the budget for 15 years, and then only under the rosiest of rosy scenarios. The hike in defense spending seems both excessive and divorced from any real strategy, while domestic spending cuts are often arbitrary or unlikely to realize the savings projected. It is stuffed with corporate welfare and pet projects. It invites another exhausting fight over The Wall.

But the hysteria surrounding the president's not-so-radical Medicare proposals is more about politics than policy.",353,New York Post,There's nothing cruel about Trump's 'Medicare cuts'
"Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and professor of Classics Emeritus at California State University, characterized Democrats' ongoing leftward movement as ""Maoist"" in its efforts to ""destroy the middle class and the traditions of America.""

Hanson joined Tuesday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight to discuss his latest book The Case for Trump, setting the stage for 2020's presidential election in an interview with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.

Hanson described the Democrats' increasing animus towards American history:

There's always a choice -- the conservative intellectuals say no -- but it always is a Manichean choice in our system, and in 2020, it's going to be not just socialism of redistribution and high tax rates, a wealth tax, abolition of student debt, it's going to be more of a Maoist all-inclusive let's tear down statues, let's rename streets, let's tear down Christopher Columbus's images, let's tear down the wall on the southern border, let's abolish ICE and ban the internal combustion engine, let's let 16-year-olds vote. It's kind of Maoist that we're trying to destroy the middle class and the traditions of America as we've understood them.

Hanson warned of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) ignorance of American history:

When Ocasio-Cortez says that all she can say about Roosevelt and Reagan is that they were racists, and she has such animus, you can see where this thing is going. She has no appreciation -- she has no knowledge -- of people dying at Guadalcanal or being blown up in B-17s over Germany so her parents could immigrate here, or what people died in Korea doing fighting global communism.

"'The Village"" offers a quaint take on the ensemble drama series.

Unlike many of its contemporaries, it's not overly weepy and melodramatic (""This Is Us,"" ""A Million Little Things"") or constructed around horrific, dystopian misery (""The Handmaid's Tale,"" ""The Walking Dead""). While ""The Village"" does, at times, skirt thisclose to preachiness, it never quite crosses that annoying line in checking many topical boxes: ICE, teenage pregnancy, illness, the politics of war and even Sept. 11.

It's an old-fashioned, feelgood hour of television a la its NBC hospital-drama stablemate, ""New Amsterdam."" And it's got two added bonuses -- gritty, contextual New York City locations (it's filmed here) and co-star Dominic Chianese, so memorable as Uncle Junior in ""The Sopranos."" I'll watch the 88-year-old Chianese in anything and he's great here, mixing humor, pathos and wisdom with such a natural touch that it's a joy to watch.

He plays Lorenzo ""Enzo"" Napolitano, one of the many characters associated directly and laterally with The Village, a Brooklyn apartment building where ""everyone is family"" and all the residents are interconnected in one way or another. The building includes Enzo's grandson, Gabe (Daren Kagasoff), a law student who dotes on his mischievous ""Pops""; single mother Sarah (Michaela McManus) and her rebellious teenage daughter Katie (Grace Van Dien); building super Ron (Frankie Faison) and his wife, social worker Patricia (Lorraine Toussaint); Ava (Moran Atias), who's arrested by ICE in the series opener; and Nick (Warren Christie), a vet who lost a leg in an IED blast. With an assist from Sarah, Nick moves into The Village after leaving the hospital to settle into his new life, and is reunited with Jedi, the dog who save his life overseas.

There's a lot more that happens in the series' first two episodes, including one neat reveal (no spoilers!). Chianese gets the lion's share of the best lines. ""I look like somebody beat me with a baseball bat and sewed me into a costume I can't take off,"" he says about his physical appearance -- but, make no mistake, Enzo is a tough old bird and will factor heavily into the ongoing plotline without getting too mawkishly sentimental. The other cast members are very good, too, particularly McManus and Van Dien. Their relationship, loving yet fraught with tension, is very realistic, and kudos to the show's casting department for finding two actresses who really could be a mother and her daughter.

Some of the plot's dramatic elements tie together a little too neatly but this is TV, after all, and ""The Village"" will transport you to a ""Can't we all just get along?"" place you wished you lived in -- with loving neighbors (who are never annoying or nasty) and a world in which a lot can go wrong, and does, yet offers hope and a chance for redemption.

It's the type of ""Village"" that welcomes you with open arms -- and should score lots of points with viewers of every stripe.",355,New York Post,'The Village' people of Brooklyn a good fit in new NBC series

TRUMP SCUTTLES DEAL THAT WOULD AVOID SENATE REBUKE

WaPo: ""President Trump said Wednesday he opposes Republican legislation to rein in presidential emergency powers -- crippling an attempt at compromise on the eve of a crucial Senate vote. Trump made his views known in a phone call with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) as Lee lunched with fellow Republican senators at the Capitol, according to a person familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it. Lee then relayed the information to his colleagues. The development came a day before the Senate votes on a disapproval resolution that would nullify the national emergency Trump has declared at the U.S.-Mexico border as a way to circumvent Congress and get billions for his wall. Lee's effort to craft legislation limiting the scope of presidential emergency powers going forward was seen as a way to limit GOP defections on the separate disapproval resolution vote.""

Undercuts Pence (again) - NYT: ""But that near certainty appeared to shift on Tuesday as Vice President Mike Pence pressed Senate Republicans at a closed-door meeting before their weekly policy lunch. A measure sponsored by Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and supported by more than a dozen Republican senators, would curtail the president's powers under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, requiring a congressional vote of approval for any new emergency declaration after 30 days.""

Buuuutttt... Pelosi had nixed it already - Fox News: ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday that she would not allow the House to take up legislation that would potentially spare President Trump from an embarrassing rebuff from Congress over his decision to declare a national emergency on the border. 'In an effort to avoid voting in favor of the House's resolution to terminate Trump's #FakeEmergency, GOP senators are proposing legislation to allow Trump to violate the Constitution *just this once.* The House will not take up this legislation to give President Trump a pass,' Pelosi tweeted.""

Senate GOP feeling froggy about challenging Trump on foreign policy - Bloomberg: ""With Democrats controlling the House and GOP senators joining with Democrats to rebuke Trump, the odds are higher that Congress in coming months could send the president legislation that contradicts his will and forces a veto. 'Congress is definitely stepping up and expressing its views,' said Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and Trump ally. ... GOP willingness to buck the president began growing last summer with a vote reaffirming U.S. support for NATO. The measure drew support from nearly every Republican in the Senate and followed Trump's statements questioning the alliance's relevance and warnings that the U.S. was spending too much money to protect European nations and getting too little in return.""

TIME OUT: BAD, BAD BIRDS

FiveThirtyEight: ""The 2018 Baltimore Orioles were so bad that we questioned whether they belonged in the major leagues at all. ... There have been a few teams who went into a season with less apparent talent than Baltimore -- but not many. Using Baseball-Reference.com, we gathered data for each American League team's opening day lineup since 1973 (to include every team who used the designated hitter full-time) and calculated those players' established WAR track records going into the season. The track records for these Orioles -- to the extent they have track records at all -- place the team at or near the low-water mark at each position relative to all other AL opening day starting lineups since 1973... Only three teams in our sample -- the 1977 and 1982 Toronto Blue Jays and the 1980 Oakland Athletics -- had lower established WAR levels for their starting lineups on Opening Day than the Orioles will have this season.""

WARREN, BIDEN POISED FOR ANOTHER SHOWDOWN

Politico: ""On a February morning in 2005 in a hearing room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Joe Biden confronted Elizabeth Warren over a subject they'd been feuding over for years: the country's bankruptcy laws. ... Fourteen years later, Warren and Biden are expected to find themselves facing off again, this time on a much larger stage. And while a bill that passed in 2005 is unlikely to dominate the 2020 Democratic primaries, the fight over the bankruptcy legislation helped shape Warren politically and could be a surprising liability for Biden in the race to become his party's choice to replace President Donald Trump. ... Delaware was home to one of the nation's biggest credit card issuers at the time, and advocates on both sides of the debate saw Biden as trying to represent his state's interests in Congress. But with emotions still raw about the banking bailouts of the Great Recession, some Democrats see Biden's vote for the bill as part of a broader record that's not as progressive as he'd like it to appear.""

Sanders' secret weapon: Sincerity - Vanity Fair: ""Tom Townsend, the president of the AFL-CIO in Dubuque, called it an uncomplicated political formula that national Democrats seemed to have lost sight of before 2016. And yet, he told me, several of the Democrats currently running for president aren't presenting a coherent rationale for their campaigns. 'There are a couple I have talked to, and I don't have a clue why they are running,' he said. 'Other than they want to run.' One candidate who does make sense for many of his fellow workers, he said, is Sanders. 'He talks to average people in a language they understand. It's been a long time since people came to Dubuque and talked about real Midwestern issues, not what donors wanted to talk about or what national people want to talk about it. What people liked about Bernie is he was genuine. No one thinks he was making crap up to get corporate donations.'""

Beto does Iowa - AP: ""Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke is planning a series of stops in Iowa beginning Thursday as he nears an announcement on a 2020 White House bid. O'Rourke, a former congressman, is set to make stops in Burlington, along the Mississippi River in southeast Iowa, and Dubuque, to the north, during his three days in Iowa, according to two people familiar with the plans. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose details of the plans. A spokesman said Monday that O'Rourke planned to visit the University of Northern Iowa on Saturday to campaign for Eric Giddens, the Democratic candidate running in a state Senate special election this month. O'Rourke released a video Monday night from Texas, announcing his support for Giddens and wearing a University of Northern Iowa cap.

Wasserman: Dems' messy process may spare Trump - NYT: ""Donald Trump's low approval ratings have attracted a crush of Democrats vying to make him a one-term president. But he might have an unlikely ally in his re-election bid: Democrats' mess of a primary system.... By contrast, the Democratic Party's egalitarian-minded rules allocate all pledged delegates to its convention on a proportional basis: A presidential candidate who receives at least 15 percent of the vote in any state or congressional district receives a corresponding share of delegates, making it difficult for a leading candidate to become a runaway train. In fact, had the 2016 Republican primary played out under Democrats' rules, it would have almost assuredly resulted in an ugly, contested convention. ... But for 2020, Democrats' jam-packed field is already on track to surpass the Republican 17-way rumble of 2016 and lacks an obvious front-runner.""

Big tech's growing 2020 woes - Rolling Stone: ""Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) rolled out the most ambitious policy plan of her presidential campaign -- and arguably of any 2020 candidate -- when she called for breaking up of the nation's three tech giants: Facebook, Amazon and Google. ... Rolling Stone can report that Warren, [Sen. Amy] Klobuchar, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli√°n Castro, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) and ex-Congressman John Delaney will appear on Saturday, March 30th, at the Heartland Forum in Storm Lake, Iowa, to discuss America's monopoly problem and other rural issues and offer solutions. (Every declared and likely Democratic candidate was invited, a spokesman for the event says.) ... The driving force behind the event -- and perhaps the larger resurgence in public understanding and desire for action around antitrust and monopolies -- is Barry Lynn, the 57-year-old founder and director of the Open Markets Institute.""

SCHULTZ OUTLINES PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVES

AP: ""Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Wednesday offered his vision for what an independent presidency could look like, even though he still hasn't decided whether to enter the White House race himself. In a speech at Miami Dade College, Schultz laid out his plans for protecting democracy and free enterprise and sought to show how a president elected outside the two-party system could repair the current dysfunction in Washington. Schultz also vowed to sign only legislation that has bipartisan support and to not put forward any Supreme Court nominee who cannot be confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate. ... Schultz also said that he would assemble a Cabinet that includes members from across the political spectrum and consists of a larger share of women than that of any previous president.""

FROM THE BLEACHERS

""G'day Chris, Just a brief point from someone here 'at the end of the world' (New Zealand - we have spoken before!) Why is that the new freshmen, who have achieved nothing in actual governing, are allowed to act as though they have achieved something in government? Why does nobody remind them (and the people) that they are - almost by definition - amateurs, as yet? Truly an example of the disaster of 'arrogance' plus 'ignorance' perhaps?"" - Mike O'Neill, New Zealand

[Ed. note: Be careful, Mr. O'Neill, or the populists will hear you. One of the core tenets of populism, no matter what political ideology, is that expertise and experience are overrated. Voters in the United States and much of the world these days have a strong feeling that the hard-won wisdom that comes through in a career in public service is outweighed by the tendency of such individuals to be elitists. When Donald Trump was running for president his inexperience was touted as an advantage by supporters. Those who are excited about the congresswomen to whom you allude would certainly say the same thing. Always good to hear from you!]

""Wasn't it Bob Dole who was mocked for referring to the 'Brooklyn' Dodgers? So now the President is referring to Tim Cook as Tim Apple, and it's a joke? Let's check that neuro workup."" - Norman F. Smith, Jr., Newtown, Pa.

[Ed. note: Poor Bob Dole. You are referencing the then-Republican nominee's Sept. 18, 1996 mishap in which he likened himself to Hideo Nomo, the Dodgers' ace who pitched a no-hitter that week. Dole was trailing President Bill Clinton substantially and Dole sought to rally supporters at a Los Angeles area speech saying that he would do as Nomo did and ""wipe them out between now and Nov. 5."" But in making his joke, Dole slipped and referenced the pre-1958 home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn, N.Y. Now, Dole obviously knew that the Dodgers were in Los Angeles, otherwise he wouldn't have referenced the team and its star player while visiting the city. But he slipped and referenced the team's home for the first 35 years of his life. Reporters looking for something that would both highlight Dole's reputation as an out-of-touch oldster and a hapless campaigner pounced. Plus, 1996 was one of the most boring elections of recent memory, and reporters will always find a way to make a living out on the dusty campaign trail. ""Dole delivers a no-no to the glory days of Brooklyn"" announced the NYT's headline. I don't know whether ""Tim Apple"" is better or worse than Dole's gaffe, but the times have certainly changed. Not only does Trump commit so many transgressions against syntax, fact and reason in his remarks that reporters can't keep up, but thanks to social media, the half-life of these moments for any politician is astonishingly short. When Adam Nagourney filed his dispatch for the Times 23 years ago from Los Angeles, the story of Dole's senior moment in California would still be unknown to almost all. Cable news was in its infancy and social media was still far off in the future. Much like the bogus story of George H.W. Bush being astounded by the existence of supermarket scanners four years prior, the Dole/Dodgers story could be shaped and mature into a meme before it was released to the general public. By the time reporters could get around to making fun of Trump for his synaptic slip, Twitter had already used up every gag, pun and jab. Pity us poor headline writers in the days of social media. All the good ones are all already taken.]

WO IST DAS TOILETTENPAPIER?

Fox News: ""A Bavarian town that accidentally ordered a 12-year supply of toilet paper is officially wiped out. The mayor of Fuchstal, a small German town of around 4,000 people near Munich, says 'the last roll has now been used up.' The toilet roll tale started in 2006 when a council employee mistakenly ordered two massive truckloads of the paper product. When the first vehicle rolled into the town, authorities realized their mistake and were able to successfully cancel the second truck. However, they were still stuck with roll upon roll on the first truck. ... Part of the reason why it took the town more than a decade to use up the toilet paper was because of the condition of the paper itself. Residents complained the gray-colored 1-ply was too flimsy, turned brittle and yellow under exposure to sunlight. Some workers refused outright to use it and opted to bring their own toiled paper from home. The silver-gray lining in the fiasco is that the botched order saved the city money because the price of wood rose the following year.""

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES...

""[Politics] is the only American industry whose participants devote prodigious sums to destroying whatever shred of allegiance any of them might once have won with their customers."" - Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 28, 1994.

"Tens of millions of Americans think members of the opposing party are less than human.

I want to begin this piece with a word of praise for Nancy Pelosi. In an interview with the Washington Post , she rejected (for now, at least) calls to impeach Donald Trump. But it's not just what she decided that's important; it's also how she explained it. Here were her key words: ""Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country.""

Taking her words at face value, Pelosi is doing something that more politicians should do when making a momentous decision -- considering the consequences not just for one's partisan tribe but also for the health of the American body politic. Striking this balance increasingly isn't just a matter of political positioning; it's a national necessity.

This morning the New York Times' Thomas Edsall published an important essay highlighting a new study that analyzed the extent of ""lethal mass partisanship."" As Edsall observes, the paper contained some disturbing statistics. Among them, ""42 percent of the people in each party view the opposition as 'downright evil.'"" A stunning 20 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans believe ""we'd be better off as a country if large numbers of the opposing party in the public today just died."" And if the opposing party wins the 2020 election, 18 percent of Democrats and 13 percent of Republicans ""feel violence would be justified.""

We hear quite a bit about ""dehumanizing rhetoric"" in American public life. Well, it appears that tens of millions of Americans now have dehumanizing beliefs. ""One out of five Republicans and Democrats agree with the statement that their political adversaries 'lack the traits to be considered fully human -- they behave like animals.'""

I wonder where those numbers would be if our nation hadn't been extraordinarily lucky in the last two years. Yes, lucky. Imagine our national culture if the congressional baseball shooter hadn't been immediately confronted by two brave Capitol Police officers. Imagine a nation where the Charlottesville terrorist kept plowing through the ranks of protesters, or where the Trump superfan bomber actually succeeded in making functioning explosives.

In a time of crisis, American citizens often look for guidance and take their cues from the subset of American citizens who are most engaged and informed. Yet study after study is now showing that this cohort of Americans is driving the engine of American division. As University of Pennsylvania professor Yphtach Lelkes told Edsall, ""Ironically, reflective citizens, who are sometimes seen as ideal citizens, might be the subset of strong partisan identifiers most likely to fall in line with the party."" Consequently, ""The democratic dilemma may not be whether low information citizens can learn what they need to know, but whether high information citizens can set aside their partisan predispositions.""

These statistics and studies confirm our personal experiences. I speak and write quite a bit about national polarization, and when I criss-cross the country, I often ask this question: ""Are the people you know who are most obsessed with politics in general more or less angry -- more or less gracious -- than the rest of your friends?"" Few people respond that their political friends are the most hopeful and tolerant members of their community.

Given the extraordinary complexity and difficulty of most political and cultural challenges, American activism and political engagement should be marked by humility and openness to opposing views. After all, who has the easy and obvious formula for racial reconciliation? For peace in the Middle East? For the repair of the American family? For sustained economic growth across all social classes in the midst of an ongoing technological revolution?

But I suppose if you believe that your opponent is more jackal than human, then there's no real need to engage -- except to destroy. All the interesting conversations will be on your side of the aisle only.

There is a link between the lethal fantasies Edsall outlines in his piece and the more widespread impulse to ""merely"" ruin the careers and livelihoods of our people we despise. At the edges, partisans are fine with seeing their political opponents physically suffer. It's far more mainstream to hope to see them financially and socially ruined.

It's in this atmosphere that I'm increasingly of the view that the vanishing, bipartisan class of civil libertarians represent an important ingredient in the glue that keeps America together. The fundamental idea that we should defend the rights of others that we would like to exercise ourselves often requires that we gain greater sympathetic understanding of our opponents' points of view. After all, the defense of liberty in the public square can never be merely legalistic. To be effective it also has to humanize.

And crucially, it also has to educate. There is simply no way to enjoy or cultivate a true culture of liberty without tolerating even terrible things. We human beings are messy mixtures of virtue and vice, and while there are vices so profound that they render a person unfit for presence in the public square, we should be very careful indeed before we try to punish a man for his thoughts. How many of history's greatest artists -- of its most interesting thinkers -- would pass our modern partisan purity tests?

We cannot keep relying on our good luck to avoid a true crisis of division (and potential violence). I'm skeptical that Pelosi's current impeachment analysis -- which places national unity over the demands of her angry activist base -- represents a true shift from toxic partisanship. After all, her caucus just passed a grievously unconstitutional and authoritarian bill that not only limits free speech but exposes more citizens to potential social shaming and economic reprisal. But her impeachment analysis still represents the right approach. It's past time for politicians and activists to recognize the urgency of the moment. Partisan hate is spiraling out of control.",357,nationalreview.com,Partisan Hate Is Becoming a National Crisis
"To the surprise of no one, Democrats in both chambers of Congress pronounced President Trump's 2020 budget proposal dead-on-arrival.

Presidents propose budgets, but it's Congress that actually writes them, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would rather dine on a mixed salad with razorblades than take advice from Trump. On anything.

Here is how I believe this year's budget battle will likely work out.

IN BORDER SECURITY DEBATE, POLICY SHOULD TRUMP RHETORIC

Pelosi will never pass Trump's budget. She might not even be able to pass her own budget, given the myriad and seemingly insatiable progressive demands in the House. Even if the House manages to pass a budget, it seems highly unlikely that they would be able to reconcile their budgetary differences with the Senate.

Rather than deliver a 2020 budget, therefore, Congress will likely wind up passing a series of continuing resolutions that keep the government chugging along. Perhaps, later this year they'll wrap it all together in a bloated omnibus compromise bill.

Both parties know it will end this way. So why bother submitting a presidential budget at all?

The answer is that the budgets put together by both sides are more messaging documents than spending plans. Both President Trump and his progressive opponents use these documents to frame their differences as starkly as possible in preparation for the 2020 elections and give voters the choice of which policy priorities to pursue.

So what are the defining priorities evident in the Trump budget? On security, it is easy to spot the three big lines in the sand separating him from the progressives.

One is defense. Trump believes in peace through strength, yet he inherited a seriously weakened, underfunded military. In his first two years, he was able to reverse some of the defense spending cuts made under the Obama administration, achieving some improvements, particularly in readiness. But there is still much work to be done.

The president's total defense request for FY2020 recognizes and responds to that need. His ""ask"" of $750 billion is quite reasonable, yet contrasts sharply with the left's view of the matter. They are looking for ways to cut military spending, going so far as to consider gutting decades of bipartisan support for the U.S. nuclear deterrent.

While Trump's messaging on the need for a strong defense is on point for FY2020, his budget itself comes up short beyond that. Spending in the out years won't even keep up with inflation. We'll have to do much better than that if we are to overmatch Russia and China.

The second clear line in the sand is the issue of border security. By any objective measure, there is a security and humanitarian crisis at the Southern border - one fueled by criminal cartels, politics on both sides of the border, and loopholes in the law that hamstring effective border security. The caravans are emblematic of the problem.

Trump argues that gaining operational control of the border is a top-tier challenge. To meet it, he has requested more funding ($8.6 billion) for the wall, detention facilities and other border security measures. The left flatly opposes this. Both sides have picked their ground. Americans will have to choose. They can either be for open borders or not.

Even if America sides with Trump, solving the problem at the border will require more than just a wall, and the president knows it. For example, loopholes in immigration law that encourage and enable illegal immigration must be closed. But that requires a heavy legislative lift - one that can occur only if the president has the support of the Congress.

The third line in the sand is diplomacy. Trump doesn't think America's conventional diplomacy, foreign assistance and international organizations are up to the big challenges of dealing with the likes of Russia and China. He is right.

In constant dollars, the State Department budget is nearly 50 percent higher than it was in the mid-'90s. Staff has increased at an even faster clip.

President Obama lavished resources on State, even as he squeezed the Pentagon. Did any of that help stem the rise of Iran, North Korea, Russia and China as destabilizing influences? The short answer is no.

"Paul Manafort's prison stay was extended Wednesday -- nearly a week after he was sentenced to 47 months on bank and tax fraud charges in a separate case. The former Trump campaign chairman is now slated to spend a total of 81 months in prison.

He was given extra prison time at his second sentencing in connection with his guilty plea related to foreign lobbying and witness tampering.

In August, Manafort became the first Trump campaign associate to be found guilty by a jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-running probe. He was convicted of eight bank and tax fraud charges at that time.

PAUL MANAFORT SENTENCED ON FOREIGN LOBBYING AND WITNESS TAMPERING CHARGES

Manafort has been the subject of an investigation over his dealings in Ukraine several years ago -- he didn't file as a foreign agent until June 2017. But Mueller has incorporated that investigation into his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trump associates.

Manafort was convicted on multiple counts of financial fraud last year in connection with his Ukranian work, and is in prison. In November, Mueller accused Manafort of lying ""on a variety of subject matters"" since his plea deal, thus violating that agreement.

Read on for a look at Manafort's work with the Trump campaign and how he is connected to the Russia investigation.

A GOP operative who worked for former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, Manafort reportedly began his work in Republican politics in the 1970s.

Eventually, Manafort was hired by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a controversial pro-Russia politician who was ousted from power twice. After Yanukovych was elected president in 2010, Manafort reportedly stayed on as an adviser and worked on other projects in Eastern Europe, including the Party of Regions political party.

Manafort also worked for Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. In 2005, Manafort allegedly came up with a plan to influence U.S. politics, business dealings and the media in order to ""greatly benefit the Putin government,"" according to The Associated Press.

Deripaska is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and signed a $10 million annual contract with Manafort in 2006; they maintained a business relationship until at least 2009.

Financial records obtained by The New York Times indicated that Manafort was in debt to pro-Russian interests by up to $17 million prior to joining Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

He also took more than a dozen trips to Moscow and frequently talked to Putin allies over a period of about 10 years, McClatchy reported. He traveled to Kiev at least 19 times in 20 months after the February 2014 removal of Ukraine's pro-Russia leader.

Manafort joined Trump's presidential campaign in March 2016 to help wrangle delegates ahead of the Republican National Convention in Ohio, something he'd done for former President Gerald Ford.

Just two months later, Manafort became Trump's campaign chairman.

Manafort's resignation from the campaign was announced on August 19, 2016, after The Times reported that he'd received $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments from Yanukovych's pro-Russian party between 2007 and 2012.

Manafort and Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016. She reportedly was said to have damaging information on Trump's campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, which was ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

Along with his former business associate Rick Gates, Manafort was initially indicted in October 2017 on multiple counts that included: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements and failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.

Nearly four months later, in February 2018, the pair were hit with additional tax evasion and bank fraud charges. These charges involved much of the same conduct Manafort and Gates were initially accused of, but the amount of money Manafort said to have laundered through offshore accounts increased to $30 million.

In June 2018, Mueller's team brought additional charges of obstruction of justice against Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate. The charges against Manafort and Gates don't relate to allegations of misconduct during Trump's campaign.

Mueller also accused Manafort of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.

Manafort was found guilty of eight counts in August in the first trial victory for Mueller's team. The judge declared a mistrial on 10 other counts after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict.

In September, Manafort pleaded guilty as part of an agreement with Mueller's team ahead of his second trial. According to Politico, the plea deal includes a 10-year cap for how long Manafort will be in prison. It also includes allowing Manafort to serve his time for both trials concurrently.

He received a nearly 4-year prison sentence on March 7 after a federal jury in Virginia convicted him on eight counts of bank and tax fraud last year. A week later, on March 13, he received an additional three and a half years on foreign lobbying and witness tampering charges.

Manafort previously maintained his innocence despite all of the charges brought before him -- but he has since expressed remorse for his actions.

"Late-night comedy legend Jay Leno said in a new interview that he does not ""miss"" hosting late-night shows, saying that the overly political left-wing rhetoric was ruining the humor.

""I don't miss it. You know, everything now is, if people don't like your politics, they -- everyone has to know your politics,"" Jay Leno told the Today show. ""When people see you as one-sided, it just makes it tough.""

""And plus, I did it when, you know, Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb, and it was just a little easier,"" he continued.

""Now it's all very serious. I'd just like to see a bit of civility come back to it, you know?"" he added. ""Because, you know, the theory when we did the show was you just watch the news, we'll make fun of the news, and get your mind off the news. Well, now people just want to be on the news all the time. You just have one subject that's the same topic every night, which makes it - makes it very hard. I mean, all the comics, Jimmy and Colbert and everybody else, it's tough when that's the only topic out there.""

President Donald Trump noticed Leno's comments, responding, ""Actually, the one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me, unwatchable. But remember, WE are number one - President!""

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105789414565908480

Leno has made comments like this before. In 2018, the former NBC host said that late-night shows under Trump had become ""depressing.""

""Now it's all anti-women, anti-LGBT, anti-Muslim, anti-Mexican, anti-Salvadoran; it's such a negative thing,"" he said. ""God bless all the late-night hosts, they make it funny, but ultimately, it's depressing. You don't really watch late-night TV to get away from reality anymore; now it's more in your face.""

However, the 68-year old is not a fan of the president. Before the 2016 election, he joked that Trump would be a better negotiator if he got beaten up.

""I think this is the problem with Donald Trump,"" he said.

""I don't think anybody has just ever beaten the crap out of him, so he has this attitude of 'whatever.' When you have the crap beat out of you, you learn how to negotiate, you learn how to deal with people.""",360,Breitbart,Jay Leno Laments 'One-Sided' Late-Night Shows: 'Everyone Has to Know Your Politics'
"An illegal immigrant with known gang ties has been arrested in the stabbing death of a San Jose woman; Jonathan Hunt has the details.

The San Diego police chief blasted California's sanctuary city policies Tuesday after a previously deported illegal immigrant with a long rap sheet was arrested for murder in the brutal stabbing of a 59-year-old woman.

Chief Eddie Garcia said the murder of Bambi Larson, who was killed inside her home Thursday afternoon, demands that police and the county have an honest conversation over the refusal to honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests for violent criminals.

""This isn't about politics, this is about public safety,"" Garcia said during a press conference Tuesday, during which he also spoke about the arrest of 24-year-old Carlos Eduardo Arevalo Carranza. ""He could have been turned over six times.""

Garcia said his officers first made contact with Arevalo Carranza, who is believed to be homeless, when he was arrested for alleged methamphetamine possession. He was cited and released KTVU reported.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WITH CRIMINAL HISTORY ARRESTED IN CALIFORNIA WOMAN'S MURDER

But DNA taken during his arrest matched samples taken from multiple locations around Larson's home and, once he was located again by police, he was arrested on suspicion of murder.

Police said Arevalo Carranza was seen on security footage ""stalking"" the area near Larson's home on the day of her murder and well as leaving the residence after the crime was committed. A connection between the two has not been determined, Garcia said.

Erik Bonnar, an acting field office director for ICE, said Arevalo Carranza had been previously deported by Homeland Security from McAllen, Texas in 2013. At some point, he returned to the U.S. and has since been arrested numerous times on suspicion of committing offenses including burglary, battery, false imprisonment, possession of methamphetamine and prowling.

In the Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties, the 24-year-old had been arrested six times - the most recent for allegedly possessing methamphetamine and paraphernalia in January.

""How many more people have to be killed or injured before California lawmakers will open discussions to revise the state policy prohibiting local law enforcement agencies from working with ICE to apprehend dangerous criminal aliens?"" Bonnar said in a statement. ""It's unfortunate that our communities face dangerous consequences because of inflexible state laws that protect criminal aliens. These sanctuary policies have unintended, but very real, and often tragic consequences to public safety.""

MAN WHO SHOT AT CALIFORNIA COP PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED, ARRESTED BUT COPS WOULDN'T HONOR ICE DETAINER, FEDS SAY

California's sanctuary law - signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2017 - largely prohibits local enforcement from keeping illegal immigrants in custody at the request of federal immigration officials.

Garcia said ICE had placed a detainer order for Arevalo Carranza, however, it was repeatedly ignored by Santa Clara County due to its sanctuary policies.

He said San Jose police do not request immigration status while making an arrest, but that ignoring detainers and releasing inmates from custody who have committed serious crimes undermines the city's safety.

""The City of San Jose and our police department has no control over how the county interacts with federal immigration enforcement or deportation of violent or serious felons like Carlos Arevalo Carranza,"" Garcia said. ""Those policies are not set at our level.""

ICE MAKES MORE ARRESTS AT DECOY UNIVERSITY; SOME DETAINEES BEING DEPORTED, AUTHORITIES SAY

He added that asking about Arevalo Carranza's immigration status would not have impacted the results of his arrest.

""We are here to protect and embrace our otherwise law-abiding, undocumented residents,"" Garcia said. ""We are not here nor should we be here to shield admitted gangsters or violent criminals regardless of immigration status.""

The Santa Clara County sheriff appeared to agree with Garcia, saying Arevalo Carranza should have remained in custody until officials with ICE had the appropriate time to evaluate his immigration status.

""It has been my long-standing position that all undocumented immigrants who are serious or violent felons, should be held for ICE evaluations,"" Sheriff Laurie Smith said in a statement. ""I will advocate to change the county policy to try to prevent this from happening again.""

""There's no crisis. There's no crisis. The only crisis is that we have a lunatic with a lot of power. That is the only crisis,"" she told Noah.

Lakshmi then shared her own story as a way to continue slicing and dicing the president's immigration policies.

""I really came here with my mother, much like these people at the border with hardly anything. What you have to understand is that, if a parent takes a child on a dangerous journey, puts them on their back, is willing to walk across deserts, that's because the place they're leaving is worse and more dangerous, and I just think we have plenty to share.""

""And if you look at all the contributions that immigrants have made, you're basically looking at what America is today, in whole, full stop.""

Turning away from politics, Noah joked with his guest that the president likes his steak well-done, to which Lakshmi sarcastically replied: ""probably with ketchup as well.""

Lakshmi's shot at Trump comes after Noah revealed earlier this week how he plans to cover the 2020 campaign.

"Nigel Farage MEP, who was ad hoc leader of the Brexit campaign for many a long year before the term was even coined, declared that the deal's rejection and Mrs May's subsequent decision to put ""No Deal"" -- currently the legal default come March 29th -- to a free vote, with her Remainer-dominated Government having no fixed position on the issue, was a ""total failure of leadership"".

Richard Tice, co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign which was the larger of the two major Brexiteer groups during the EU referendum and now co-chairman of the Leave Means Leave campaign alongside Farage, said MPs were right to have voted down ""the worst deal in history"" but warned that they must not take No Deal off the table.

More specifically, he demanded that should the Prime Minister herself vote against No Deal, she must resign, having stated repeatedly that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" both during and after the 2017 snap election from which she derives her democratic mandate, such as it is.

Tory Brexiteers who sit in Parliament seem somewhat less combative, apparently dreading the prospect of their Remainer colleagues voting to effectively strangle a clean Brexit -- and possibly any Brexit at all -- in today's free vote on No Deal.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer Tories, told the BBC that the fundamental problem ""is that we have a historic disconnection between the House of Commons and the electorate; 52 percent of the voters voted to leave, but in the House of Commons probably 500 out of 650 MPs supported Remain, and this disconnect is actually quite troubling for our politics, because the House of Commons is ignoring the majority of the British people.""

Indeed, conservative philosopher Edmund Burke, whose famous Bristol address is often used by modern MPs as an excuse to ignore the wishes of their electors, warned in his Thoughts on the Present Discontents that the House of Commons ""was not instituted to be a control upon the people... It was designed as a control for the people.""

He added that it would be better ""that the House of Commons should be infected with every epidemical [frenzy] of the people, as this would indicate some consanguinity, some sympathy of nature with their constituents, than that they should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors,"" because ""By this want of sympathy they would cease to be a House of Commons.""

Other MPs appeared to be more sanguine, with former Brexit minister Steve Baker, who resigned from Mrs May's government along with Secretary of State David Davis over the terms she was proposing for the deal and accused her of having abused the constitution to put it together, using its defeat as an excuse to table to so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" as a parliamentary amendment.

Rees-Mogg's signature was appended to the document alongside Baker's, although apparently not in his own hand, alongside that of other prominent Brexiteers including former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith -- but the involvement of equally prominent Remainers including Nicky Morgan and Mrs May's former right-hand man Damian Green may give many Brexit supporters pause for thought about the scheme.

The Prime Minister was under no obligation to allow MPs to effectively overturn the British people's vote to Leave the European Union by offering them a vote on taking ""No Deal"" off the table -- handing Brussels the power to kill Brexit stone dead by refusing to offer anything but unacceptable terms -- as it would have been within her constitutional power to call on the Queen to prorogue (suspend) the parliamentary session until after March 29th, when No Deal would have occurred by default under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018.

That she is allowing her openly rebellious Remainer ministers a free vote on the issue -- while Brexiteers were not allowed to take a position against her deal -- has led many to question whether she ever intended to deliver a clean Brexit in any circumstances.",363,Breitbart,"Brexiteers Glad to See May's Deal Defeated, But Fear 'No Deal' Vote"
"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is headed this weekend to the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, fueling speculation that the two-term progressive mayor of America's largest city is seriously considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

De Blasio's political team announced late Tuesday night that the mayor and his wife, Chirlane McCray, would spend Saturday afternoon in Manchester, and on Sunday travel to Claremont, the birthplace of McCray's mother.

DE BLASIO BLASTS REP. OMAR'S ISRAEL COMMENTS

A release from de Blasio's team added that ""more stops may be added. A full schedule for the trip will be released later this week.""

The trip to New Hampshire follows a visit last month to Iowa, the state that votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar. And last weekend, de Blasio and his wife traveled to South Carolina, the state that holds the first southern primary along the road to the White House.

De Blasio planned a Feb. 15 visit to the Granite State, but canceled after the fatal shooting of a New York City police officer earlier that week. But he did travel to Massachusetts to speak at a forum at the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics on Feb. 14.

Last month, the mayor told New York City reporters ""I'm not ruling it out"" when asked about his 2020 intentions.

BIDEN STRONGLY HINTS AT 2020 RUN

DeBlasio's predecessor at City Hall in New York, former three-term Mayor Mike Bloomberg, announced last week that he would not run for the Democratic nomination after seriously considering a bid. Bloomberg made a two-day campaign-style swing through New Hampshire in late January, as he was weighing a 2020 run.

If de Blasio runs, he would enter a crowded field of candidates.

Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have launched bids.

Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama, are also running, as are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

"Alienated globalists, following political fashion, anticipate the death of the West.

Everything's confused now. Narratives are manipulated, ethics keeps shifting. This uncertainty should make German filmmaker Christian Petzold's Transit the revelation of the year. Here's why it's not:

Trend-follower Petzold (Barbara, Phoenix, Jerichow) has found another way to stay in step with progressive politics. His thriller Transit twists modern concerns about national identity, immigration, and fascism into a personal, artsy mystery.

Petzold starts with Georg (Franz Rogowski), an emotionally wounded German living in France, during a spookily contemporary, unspecified putsch, who seeks refuge in the Americas. (Ah, Mexico, gateway to the United States' open arms.)

Anna Seghers's 1942 novel Transit, about a man in spiritual and social flux, used ominous, empty European settings marked by urban graffiti.

Georg's statelessness is reflected in the disaffected transients he encounters: a friend who begs him to deliver a subversive writer's letter to the wife he left behind; an immigrant child with a mute mother (Lilien Batman and Maryam Zaree); a doctor (Godehard Giese) anxious to defect; and a mysterious, haunted beauty (Paula Beer) who might be the letter's intended recipient.

These wayfaring strangers evoke Casablanca's usual suspects minus Hollywood's vulgar sensationalism. Casablanca's director, Michael Curtiz, pitched every moment to a melodramatic peak, but Petzold aims for cool sophistication. His approach demonstrates the millennium's pallid existentialism.

Actor Rogowski's perpetually worried grimace resembles Joaquin Phoenix doing his tortured-soul routine in You Were Never Really Here, a nihilistic Taxi Driver remake by Britain's token female artiste, Lynne Ramsay. Ramsey emphasized grindhouse gore the same way Curtiz used corniness. Short of such low-down audacity, Petzold gives Transit globalist sentimentality.

The mother and child whom Georg befriends are refugees from the Third World, but in this film's vision of international ennui, the Third World has merged into all Europe. Transit's displaced-persons story is meant to be universal, capturing globalism's anti-patriotic mode -- the same progressive's sentimentality seen in Cold War and Never Look Away.

If Transit satirized today's European art-film tendencies, it might have achieved the zeitgeist shock of Brady Corbet's Vox Lux, but, instead, this movie proves that film culture at large has reached a stage where moviemakers and reviewers devote themselves to maundering and following social trends. That's why no good, original film has emerged from Sundance or South X Southwest in decades. Conservative filmgoers need to realize this fact and be wary of it. Hollywood and its wannabes work to keep filmgoers aligned with political fashion and hipster schmaltz.

Note that Georg evolves from Kafka as well as the classic German existentialist protagonist devised by Georg B√ºchner in Alban Berg's opera Wozzeck. Deep inside this Casablanca knock-off is a modern version of B√ºchner's fatalism, anticipating the death of the West. (Death-of-the-West sorrow also explains the American race-exploitation films Get Out and BlacKkKlansman.)

Reviewers who favor open borders are easily impressed with Transit. The Times calls it ""a labyrinth of a movie,"" The Wrap calls it ""a misery of a movie."" It's a little of both and nothing new. Alain Tanner's 1984 In the White City made similar European alienation erotic and life-affirming. Petzold's Casablanca-meets-Kafka exercise is a world-weary clich√©. He confirms Transit's unoriginality with the end-credits musical theme: Talking Heads' 1986 ""Road to Nowhere,"" an existential ditty that signaled the hip-cynical decline of that once great pop group.",365,nationalreview.com,"""Transit"" Is a Trendy ""Casablanca"" Knockoff"
"Only Fox News carries an alternative view, all other networks speak with one voice almost entirely in sync with the Democratic Party.

Ever notice how certain people have started to disappear? Not vagrants or runaways, the usual missing persons. But fairly prominent, well-educated people with dissenting political opinions. One day you're watching or reading them online. The next time you check, they're gone. You can't find their videos. They're not showing up in your Facebook feed. Suddenly you can't buy their books on Amazon.

You Google them to find out what happened and discover they've been banned. They're being called dangerous extremists, bigots and Nazis. For the public good, they've been shut down. Disappeared.

You're a little surprised to hear this. They didn't seem evil or radical to you. They were just free thinkers, saying something a little different from the party line on CNN. You don't complain about it, though. You don't want anyone to know you were watching forbidden videos. There's a penalty for that.

This is what an authoritarian society looks like. It's a place where the group in charge will tolerate no criticism at all. That's what we're becoming.

It was only a matter of time before they came for Fox News. Of the top dozen news networks in the United States, only Fox has an alternative view. The other channels speak with one voice. They are united on every issue, every time. They're in almost perfect sync with the priorities of the Democratic Party.

Fox News stands apart. The opinion shows on this channel have another perspective. You might consider that valuable diversity, something different in a sea of sameness. The left does not think that. They would like Fox News shut down tomorrow. The other news channels agree. They would like that too. They are trying to do it now.

It's worth explaining how the process of banning ideas works, the means by which so many voices have already been silenced. The first step is defining political disagreement as a mortal threat to the country. Something that's dangerous. That's the job of a group called the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization whose name intentionally masks its role as an enforcer for the Democratic establishment.

Groups or individuals who challenge the official story on virtually any subject find themselves designated as a ""hate group"" by the SPLC. This is a handy way to crush your political enemies. By definition, hate groups don't have legitimate ideas or positions. They spew only hate. You don't have to listen to them or debate their claims. You can ignore everything they say. Your only duty is to suppress them. That's the beauty of the SPLC: Once they call the people you disagree with a ""hate group,"" you can immediately move to shut them up by force. That's what they do.

That's where Media Matters comes in. Media Matters is a George Soros-funded lobbying organization whose sole mission is to punish critics of the Democratic Party. Media Matters often uses propaganda from the Southern Poverty Law Center to bully corporations, news executives and tech companies into punishing people it doesn't like. Not surprisingly, the media love Media Matters.

One former Media Matters employee described the group's relationship with MSNBC this way: ""We were pretty much writing their primetime."" When Media Matters issued a press release, MSNBC picked it up ""verbatim."" Media Matters staffers once explained the organization's close relationship with many journalists in the national press corps were vast. Here are some quotes:

""Greg Sargent of the Washington Post will write anything you give him.""

""Ben Smith [now at Buzzfeed] will take stories and write what you want him to write.""

""The people at Huffington Post were always eager to cooperate.""

Brian Stelter has since left the New York Times. He's now more CNN spokesman than journalist, specializing in announcing proclamations from his boss, Jeff Zucker. He takes his talking points from Media Matters.

They would like Fox News shut down tomorrow. The other news channels agree. They would like that too. They are trying to do it now.

""It's about decency!"" cries Stelter. ""We must have decency!"" By which, Stelter means, less disobeying. More obedience. ""Stop criticizing the program!"" Or else.

This is the face of state media. Why does Fox even exist, they wonder. We've got 11 other perfectly good channels, all of them approved by management and obedient to the people in charge. How could anybody watch something different? Fox can't be legitimate. They must be lying. Their viewers must be stupid. Listen to ""Don L'Mon"" and the New York governor's brother tell you why Fox News shouldn't even be allowed:

Don Lemon, CNN anchor: As journalists, we have to give you the facts, but what happens there (at Fox) is you don't talk about the substance of what you said or if it's factual or not. You don't talk about that. What you do is you say ""Everybody's out to get me. Everyone is out to get conservatives ... They just say, ""There's outrage on the left, and they have Trump derangement syndrome"" without ever addressing the substance.

Chris Cuomo: They're not about facts. They're about feelings.

Lemon: And then their audience just eats it up. ""Yeah! that's right!"" Not even caring about the facts.

Don L'Mon is calling you dumb. Savor the moment. But there's an ominous undertone to all this.

Don L'Mon doesn't have the power to have you arrested. Dana Nessel does. Nessel is the attorney general of Michigan. She has created a special ""hate crime unit,"" whose charter is to investigate any organization identified as a ""hate group"" by the SPLC. This is what weaponized politics looks like. Criticize the people in charge, and the SPLC will sick men with guns on you. It's terrifying.

Even worse, you're subsidizing it, without knowing it. Both the SPLC and Media Matters are, amazingly, tax-exempt organizations. In its original tax application to the IRS, Media Matters claimed that the American news media were dominated by a pro-Christian bias and that they were needed to balance it. Despite the obvious absurdity of this claim, the group received non-profit status. It has been violating the terms of that status ever since.

During the Obama administration, Media Matters held weekly strategy discussions with the White House about how to hurt its political enemies. Media Matters kept an ""enemies list"" of Republicans to destroy, including Steve King of Iowa. This is a violation of federal tax law. Tax-exempt non-profits can't function as an arm of a political party. Media Matters clearly does.

According to a piece in the liberal magazine The New Republic, Media Matters changed its mission during the 2016 Democratic primaries to campaign for Hillary Clinton. We were ""running defense for Clinton,"" one Media Matters staffer said. ""Defending Hillary from every blogger in their mother's basement."" In a leaked 2015 memo from inside Clinton's campaign, staff discussed cooperating with Media Matters to attack Republicans and accuse the press of biased coverage.

In an email from January 5, 2016, Hillary's staff discussed working with Media Matters to counter a Vanity Fair article on Huma Abedin. ""We have Media Matters and core surrogates lined up, which we can expand on tomorrow,"" the email read.

This isn't just unethical. It's illegal. Under IRS regulations, 501(c)(3), non-profits are totally prohibited from participating in the campaigns of political candidates. Media Matters broke the law. The group has never been punished. It retains its tax-exempt status.

That means you and every other taxpayer are subsidizing attacks on their own First Amendment. Why is this? How can this be happening? Someone should call the IRS and find out.",366,Fox News,Tucker Carlson: We're becoming an authoritarian society - and the group in charge is coming after Fox News

"Unmasking the Administrative State: The Crisis of American Politics in the Twenty-First Century, John Marini, Encounter Books, 337 pages

John Marini, who writes for the Claremont Review of Books and is a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, has devoted his newest book to the origins and growth of the American administrative state. Marini recognizes that he is dealing with a critical turning point in American government. To his credit, he refuses to examine it nonchalantly, as the natural development of a benevolent state that exists as an indispensable answer to our needs. According to Marini, rule by unelected administrators who are empowered to intervene in a wide range of human relations, to regulate the behavior of citizens and to enforce their own values, was not part of our original political design. It represents a dramatic departure from what our federal union was intended to be, and a deviant model that may already be beyond our control.

As someone who wrote a book on a related subject, I was eager to learn how Marini treated the growth of centralized public administration in the United States. It may be appropriate to divide his analysis into two sections -- one that shows how our administrative behemoth has eaten into social, cultural, and commercial activities; and another that focuses on the ideological preconditions for that development. His book in my view addresses the first better than the second.

Marini begins by examining the role of the federal government in helping to topple the Nixon administration, a topic that he's treated before. He argues compellingly that by ""the time of Nixon's reelection in 1972, he posed the greatest danger to the authority of the bureaucracy and the administrative state."" Unlike Reagan, who also awakened the deep state's ""political animosity"" but who managed to appear jovial, Nixon went after them with undisguised loathing. He stressed in his second inaugural address his intention to ""diffuse"" political power among various levels of government. His downfall, at least partly caused by his impetuous behavior, signaled to office-holders the danger of messing with powerful foes. Now Trump has broken with that unwritten rule and incurred the wrath of our unelected government and its far-ranging allies in the media, public education, and Hollywood. Anyone who threatens what Marini calls the ""new despotism"" posed by centralized administration runs the risk of being destroyed by it.

Marini is correct that the Progressives played a gigantic role in justifying and building an American administrative state. But he may go too far in indulging his own grievance about Progressives being racists, anti-immigrationists, and social Darwinists -- which is largely beside the point in any case. What made the Progressives a significant historical force was not that they held conventional views for their times. It was that, as Marini certainly knows, they identified popular government with public administration and a ""science of government."" And contrary to what the GOP media tell us, self-described Progressives belonged to and influenced both national parties.

Seemingly unaware of this, the author devotes an entire chapter to a questionable divide between FDR's political legacy and that of Ronald Reagan. Whereas FDR favored an administrative regime ""that would guarantee social and economic security for all,"" Reagan, as Marini put it elsewhere, ""succeeded in mobilizing a powerful sentiment over the excesses of big government. In doing so, he revived the debate over the importance of limited government for a free society. And his theme would remain constant throughout his presidency."" But did Reagan's rhetoric about ""limited government"" mean that he set out to reverse FDR's reforms? Guess again! Marini's model president mostly took for granted a vast administrative apparatus that he inherited from his predecessor. And this welfare state intruded into our daily lives to a far greater extent than the government bequeathed to posterity by the New Deal.

The Social Security program begun by FDR continued to grow under Reagan, expanding 15 percent during his eight years in office. Despite initial efforts to apply strict means tests to welfare recipients, the Reagan administration increased welfare costs by 25 percent between 1981 and 1987. There is, of course, nothing wrong with recognizing that both national parties have inherited a swollen administrative state and that it's been hard to cut back without alienating large numbers of voters and an entrenched bureaucracy. But let's not pretend that Reagan was a bold anti-New Deal revolutionary when the evidence for this hardly exists. A point that Marini might have mentioned is that in the early 1980s, most Western countries slowed the expansion of their social services, an expansion that had been going on since the 1960s. In the United States, this slowdown began during the latter half of Jimmy Carter's presidency and continued at a brisker pace in 1981 and 1982.

Marini's learned account of how we arrived at our present government, one that ""administers"" rather than deliberates, as the Founding Fathers hoped our federal legislature would do, reveals wide-ranging erudition. But he might have spared us his practice of repeating all the talking points of his colleagues at the Claremont Institute. Supposedly no one, including many defenders of Abraham Lincoln, understood as well as Harry Jaffa and Jaffa's students the natural rights basis of the American regime and indeed all decent governments. Lincoln fought the Civil War to realize the Claremont Institute's vision of American government, while rejecting alternative understandings of who we are as a nation.

Marini maintains that in Hegel's philosophy, individual rights vanish into the ""rational will of the state."" In the book's introduction, Ken Masugi lets us know (lest we miss the point) that the author is carrying forward the philosophical tradition of Jaffa, ""who took account of the radical assaults on constitutional government demanded by Rousseau and above all, Hegel."" Pace Marini and Jaffa, Hegel's main political work, Philosophy of Right, defends the force of individual contracts and the inviolable existence of civil society. Hegel's vindication of historical rights and the ""ethical state"" does not come at the expense of property or family rights. Marini's fellow Straussian (although not of the West Coast persuasion) Steven B. Smith makes this argument quite cogently in Hegel's Critique of Liberalism: Rights in Context.

Marini also quotes Progressive theorists who tell us that rights are the products of particular historical traditions. It is strongly suggested that these commentators were morally or intellectually defective. With few exceptions, however, they were telling us what is obvious about the evolution of political rights. According to Marini, ""contemporary ideology and politics become intelligible only with reference to a philosophy of history, which originated in the political thought of Kant and Hegel."" As someone who has written on both German philosophy and the administrative state, I am truly puzzled by this statement. Am I supposed to think that German philosophers, who failed to adopt Marini's view of natural rights, brought about our runaway public administration? Some Progressives like John Dewey read Hegel (and also Kant) but did so selectively in order to confirm what they already believed about ""democratic administration.""

Marini gets one point perfectly right, and it is his main one. He cites German political theorist Carl Schmitt about ""the crisis of German parliamentary government"" in order to buttress his key point, that legislatures have been forced into doing what they were not meant to do. For Schmitt, this fact illustrated the ultimate weakness of the interwar German experiment in parliamentary government. What was intended to be a deliberative body, namely the Reichstag, was, according to Schmitt, pushed into performing a different function because of an often indecisive executive. (Schmitt was famously arguing for a presidential dictatorship to save the German republic from its enemies.)

In the American case, as Marini points out, Congress in its present incarnation oversees administration and makes business deals by leveraging its influence with the public bureaucracy. Rather than serving as a deliberative body, it has become a deal-making one. The rise to power of the modern administrative state under technical congressional oversight has led to this undesirable arrangement. Let me repeat: Marini is dead on in his analysis of ""legislative bureaucratic supremacy."" He is correct when he argues that our main problem at the federal level is not the abandonment of power by Congress. The real problem is that we are being technically ""administered"" by congressional agencies that run roughshod over our historic liberties. Even more alarming is that there may be no way out of this situation.

"Leaders of the new Blue and White Party: Moshe Ya'alon (Wikimedia); Lt. General Benny Gantz (IDF); Gabi Ashkenazi (public domain)

Imagine if almost all the Democrats running for president were ex-generals, and their main claim to rule was that, well, they were ex-generals. That's the situation Israel has found itself in, about which is said: ""Israel is an army with a country rather than a country with an army.""

Military officers, both in and out of uniform, have played an outsized role in every aspect of Israeli life. Moshe Dayan, with his fetching eyepatch, established the archetype. Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon both overcame mixed military legacies (as defense minister, Sharon was officially admonished for his role in the Sabra and Shatila massacre of Arabs in 1982) to make history as prime ministers. The martyred Rabin was the architect of the uneasy rapprochement with Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Sharon, who was denied Israel's top military job, stopped the peace process begun by Rabin in its tracks.

Shimon Peres was never a member of this club. His lifetime of leadership in Israel's security system, including his central role in creating the Israeli nuclear arsenal, failed to erase the sense that he was somehow an outsider. Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not himself a career soldier but he was an officer in the storied special forces of the Sayeret Makhtal, and his brother, Yoni, was an outsized casualty of Israel's famed rescue at the airport in Entebbe.

With few notable exceptions, the record of Israel's military chiefs as political and national leaders is less than stellar. For every Yitzhak Rabin, there are numerous pretenders like Yigal Yadin, Amram Mitzna, Shaul Mofaz, and Dan Shomron, whose stars sparkled brightly before quickly flaming out. Israel's generals may have indeed proved their mettle on the battlefield, but their best days in politics were usually their first.

The latest example of the effort to spin military leadership into political gold is the creation of ""Blue and White,"" a coalition headed by -- you guessed it -- a former chief of staff, Benny Gantz, who retired from the military in 2015.

The election on April 9 remains Netanyahu's to lose, but Gantz is treading a well-worn path. Since combining with another party to form Blue and White, he is winning public support less because of his political program, which in Gantz's case is on the right side of anodyne, than of what he represents: the responsible stewardship of Israel's military prowess in its never-ending battle against the Arabs.

Gantz, wrote one observer in the Jerusalem Post, ""is an ideological free agent, which only increases his political value.""

Though they are increasingly fewer in number, there are Israelis who still favor a retreat from the West Bank and the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. On this, Blue and White is definitely not their party. Indeed, one party leader described the movement as the new Likud. Bottom line: a vote for Gantz is not a vote against the program of the long-ruling Likud, but merely against Netanyahu's leadership of it.

Joining Gantz are two other ex-chiefs of staff in the military troika at the head of the new faction, Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Ya'alon.

Ya'alon was an undisguised opponent of Secretary of State John Kerry's negotiating effort, calling Kerry ""delusional."" Ashkenazi's sympathies are less hard-edged. In Israel today, this translates into support for what used to be viewed as a right-wing national security agenda.

Ya'alon was Netanyahu's minister of defense and famously opposes any retreat on the West Bank or the creation of a Palestinian state. His political journey reflects that of the nation itself. Born and raised in the nurturing cradle of the long-ruling Labor Party, after leaving the Army's top job in 2005, Ya'alon became a star in Likud, which suffered Labor's uncontested rule for decades until 1977 when Menachem Begin and his settlement agenda prevailed.

Earlier this week, Gantz led a train of ex-military, intelligence, and security leaders, including former Mossad and Shabak (internal security) bosses, and the three other ex-chiefs of staff on the party list, to the Golan Heights.

They traveled to the Syrian border to declare that Israel would never retreat from the Golan Heights and would continue pushing for international recognition of Israel's sovereignty over the territory -- a new favorite idea of Republicans in the Senate -- which Israel captured in the June 1967 war.

""We will increase the settlement of the Golan in a way that shows the world clearly -- we will not come down from the Golan; the opposite -- it will be developed and [its population] doubled,"" Gantz said.

None of this is news to Bashar al-Assad. But of course, sitting in Damascus 269 kilometers away, he wasn't the audience.

Gantz's campaign strategy appears to be producing electoral dividends, so much so that he is considering how to form the next Israeli government after elections on April 9 -- with Bibi's party, but without the battle-scarred political veteran himself.

Netanyahu's strategy to confront this challenge is an improbable one, which nevertheless has proven effective before. He is trying to convince voters that these standard-bearers, who have spent a lifetime in service to the country -- Gantz's was selected by Bibi himself to lead the army -- are in fact dangerous leftists. A Likud campaign video cautioned that the former generals are in league with those who would ""hand the Gaza periphery to Hamas,"" and ""will sit with [Arab lawmaker Ahmad] Tibi in an [electoral] bloc"" if he wins the April election.

Netanyahu's credentials as ""Mr. Security"" and Arab baiting are standard fare on the prime minister's election strategy menu. The generals commanding Blue and White may find his troops harder to defeat than the Palestinians.

"""Does Nancy Pelosi Know Something?"" asks Charlie Cooke. He's talking about Pelosi's highly publicized remark to the Washington Post Magazine that she's against impeaching President Trump because ""he's just not worth it."" Why would Pelosi announce her position now? She's under fire from her younger, more radical colleagues. And Robert Mueller's report is yet to be released.

What Pelosi knows is just how unpopular impeachment is likely to be. She's in the rare position, at least in the House, of having institutional memory -- of knowing how polarizing and difficult earlier attempts at impeachment have been. And she can read. Democrats might tell pollsters they want to impeach Trump, but Democrats, thank heaven, do not make up the entirety of the country. Pelosi's majority rests on districts that have voted for Republicans in the recent past, districts where voters are resistant to sudden change, whether it be eliminating private insurance or removing a president from office prior to an election. Last November, voters told exit pollsters that Congress should not impeach Trump, 56 percent to 39 percent. Half of respondents in a December CNN poll were against impeachment. A March Monmouth poll had support for impeaching rising slightly, but still at only 42 percent.

The calendar also works against impeachment. The first Democratic presidential debate is three months away. Beginning a process to remove Trump, first by House vote and then by Senate trial, would roil the primary. The Senate would vote for acquittal just around the time the parties are readying their conventions. Voters, already sour on impeachment, may rebel against the Democratic attempt to force the president from office months before the public has its say. The politics aren't right. Impeachment might be the rage at the Women's March and on some cable networks, but it's exactly the sort of thing that could backfire and send Pelosi home to San Francisco.

There's something else Pelosi knows. The publicly available information about President Trump does not warrant his impeachment. Shady contacts with Russian operatives and a potential campaign-finance violation aren't enough. Nor can Mueller be counted on to provide the smoking gun. That's why the House has embarked on its fishing expedition, why the New York state attorney general's office is poring over the president's business record. They're getting desperate. Pelosi's against impeachment because she understands that the Democrats' best chance at overturning the 2016 result remains the 2020 election. Now all she needs to do is convince the radicals who increasingly drive the agenda of the Democratic party.",371,nationalreview.com,What Pelosi Knows about Impeachment | National Review
"Today, Senators Mike Lee and Joni Ernst are introducing the Child Rearing and Development Leave Empowerment (CRADLE) Act, which will enable new parents to access their Social Security benefits to help them take time off from work following the birth or adoption of a child (this ""Social Security Earned Leave"" concept was first introduced in this IWF paper, written by Kristin Shapiro, and similar to legislation proposed by Senator Marco Rubio last year)

Conservatives have long opposed the idea of government involvement in the provision of paid-leave benefits, recognizing its tremendous downsides, but the approach taken by Lee and Ernst avoids those downsides: It simply reforms an existing entitlement program so that people have greater flexibility and control over when they can access benefits. It does not require new tax revenue. It does not affect the benefits or obligations of anyone other than those who opt to take parental leave benefits -- so it's fair to everyone who doesn't have children and doesn't need or want this kind of leave. It will not meaningfully discourage employers from offering paid-leave benefits on their own. It does not increase government's overall obligations.

And it has tremendous upsides: It would help new parents who face financial pressure when having a baby, giving them more time to recover and bond, which is associated with better health for baby, mom, and the family. It will make it less likely that people turn to government assistance, thereby decreasing pressure on other safety net programs and saving taxpayers money. Women are more likely to stay in the labor force, increasing their earnings and family incomes.

This is good politics, in addition to good policy. Americans overwhelmingly want workers to have access to paid time off following the adoption or birth of a baby. As IWF's Hadley Manning wrote last week on NRO's homepage, more states (such as Colorado) are working to pass paid-leave entitlement plans -- which impose new taxes on all workers, will make workplaces drop their current paid-leave packages in favor of government plans, and discourage true flexibility. As more states go in this direction, it becomes more likely than businesses will support a federal solution to relieve them of a patchwork of state and local programs. Democrats, including the presidential candidates, will push for a sweeping and costly new paid-leave entitlement programs, and work with the complicit media to paint those who oppose paid leave as heartless and indifferent to the challenges of working families, particularly women.

The Lee-Ernst proposal shows that conservatives do care about struggling working moms and dads, and want to modernize the safety net. This isn't a step away from the conservative principles of limited government and economic liberty, but a way to make good on those ideals by making government better, rather than bigger.",372,nationalreview.com,Senators Ernst and Lee Introduce Conservative Earned-Leave Bill | National Review
"Theresa May has lost her latest 'meaningful vote' on Brexit - as of course, we all knew she would.

Nobody liked her Withdrawal Agreement when parliament voted it down in January - humiliatingly rejecting it by a 230 vote margin.

Nobody liked her Withdrawal Agreement this time either - not least because it was the same Brexit In Name Only (BRINO) fudge as before, only with added legalese pretending that there was some kind of built-in exit clause.

Brexiteer Boris Johnson once famously described Theresa May's first Withdrawal Agreement as a ""polished turd""

The new one, you could say, was the same turd rolled in glitter.

Given that everyone, but everyone, knew exactly what was lurking beneath that twinkling exterior, it's a wonder that it yet managed to garner as many 242 votes (40 more than last time).

Why did they do so?

Fear, mainly. They had been persuaded by the argument that Theresa May's BRINO deal was the closest to Brexit they were ever going to get and that if they rejected it, it's only going to suffer death by a thousand cuts administered by Remain-dominated parliament.

It is entirely possible that in this analysis, champions of Theresa May's glitter-dipped turd are correct.

These Champions of the Shimmery Turd include such luminaries as my old friend Environment Secretary and former leading Brexiteer Michael Gove and my Spectator colleague, political editor James Forsyth. They know far more about politics and parliamentary procedure than I'll ever know, so I'm really not questioning either their expertise or their intellectual integrity.

I'm quite sure that they genuinely believe that the Shimmery Turd really was the nation's only hope of getting anything close to the Brexit we voted for on June 23 2016 - and that now it has been flushed away we'll soon come to miss its merry stench.

But Britain, thank God, is not primarily made up of people who are experts in politics and parliamentary procedure and the ""art of the possible.""

Rather, mainly, it is made up of people like you and me. People who on the whole think that Westminster is a cesspit of liars, chancers, trimmers, troughers, time servers, spivs, compromisers and charlatans. And cowards: most of all, cowards.

People who on being told that they can't be given the Brexit they voted for in June 2016 because ""reasons"" don't roll over and go: ""Ah well. If the experts say we can't have Brexit, we can't have Brexit."" People who instead go: ""Sod that for a game of soldiers. I want what I voted for and I'm not going away till I get it.""

This is why I found myself so heartily applauding one of the reader comments below one of Forsyth's Spectator blogs yesterday headlined ""There may be a Brexit breakthrough on the backstop.""

(This breakthrough never happened by the way. The European Union, led by the intransigent and frankly evil Martin Selmayr, is determined to give us less than nada)

Oh do shut up, Forsyth, This is pathetic. If the EU were anything but a bunch of crooks, we wouldn't need this obscure, secondary legal ""perhaps"" argument.

Your sort have produced this, you myopic little turd. A great nation reduced to arguing over whether some back-of-the-fag-packet bullshit can perhaps (given a load of maybes) guarantee our ancient liberties?

The WA is appalling - worse than the terms foisted on Germany, for waging genocide. Only traitorous scum could even consider signing it. If we need legal interpretations that are ""defensible"" to ensure our freedoms - what a ""shameful conquest"" we (or rather you) have made of us.

It's not the rudeness to Forsyth I'm applauding. (He's a very amiable chap). Just the forthright expression of what so many of us feel.

We look at Westminster - and most of the attached media class - aghast at how such a bunch of cowardly sell-outs can be representing us.

Given the choice, surveys show, more British would go for a No Deal Brexit than any other option.

The EU's contemptuous treatment of us has only hardened our resolve.

So if all the Remainer MPs in parliament are feeling pleased with themselves about the prospects tomorrow of voting No Deal Brexit out of contention, they are living in a fool's paradise.

No good can come of it when parliament is so badly out of tune with the electorate it is supposed to serve.",373,Breitbart,Delingpole: Good Riddance to May's Withdrawal Agreement - a Turd Rolled in Glitter

Trump might prove incapable of engineering such a dramatic reversal of fortune. But if the economy continues to hum and he racks up a couple of wins on foreign policy, the public's perception of his presidency could shift. Democrats can't bank on voters being more dismayed by him than they are enamored of us. For that reason, Democrats need to take a strategic approach to the next 20 months. In the last election, Democrats were too quick to dismiss the possibility that voters would take Trump 'seriously, not literally.'

TIME OUT: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT SOCRATES

NatGeo: ""Socrates is considered by many to be the founding father of Western philosophy -- as well as one of the most enigmatic figures of ancient history. He wrote nothing himself, so all knowledge of the Greek philosopher has been handed down through the writings of his contemporaries and his students, primarily his star pupil, Plato. Scholars still grapple with 'the Socratic problem': how to distinguish the historical Socrates from the individual portrayed and interpreted by various authors through the ages. But as any law student will attest, his interrogative 'Socratic method' of teaching is as alive and well today as it was when the great thinker questioned everything and everyone in Athens in the fifth century B.C. Socrates first distinguished himself as a hoplite, or heavily armed infantryman, in the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. ...

Our balanced budgets at the end of the previous century were the result of the dawn of the information age and the end of the Cold War, but they were also caused by the independent candidacy of Ross Perot, who poked both major parties with a very sharp stick on the subject of debt and borrowing. Voters want balanced budgets and creative candidates will sooner or later find a way to make it a winning issue.]

""As a [Massachusetts] resident perhaps I'm in no position to ask this question but... what is up with the ... districts which elected Reps. [Ilhan Omar] and [Rashida Tlaib]? Was there really no viable opponent in either case? Or was it a matter of low turnout deciding for the district as a whole, as was the case with [Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez]? Thanks!"" - Frank Townley, Dover, Mass.

[Ed. note: Omar's Minneapolis district and Tlaib's Detroit district are among the most Democratic in the nation. It would be about as likely for a Republican to win there as it would be for a Democrat to prevail in North Georgia or Eastern Kentucky. And as is the case in many such districts, red and blue, the primary is the only real contest. In the case of both Omar and Tlaib, crowded primary fields and a breakdown in party machinery allowed unlikely winners to slip past more mainstream choices. In Tlaib's case, the situation was compounded by the resignation of longtime Congressman John Conyers amid a #metoo scandal. While Ocasio-Cortez felled an entrenched incumbent in New York, her fellow insurgents had easier rows to hoe.]

WKRC: ""The season of Lent means Christians are fasting and giving up certain pleasures or vices. One Ohio man is taking a page from history. For 46 days, Del Hall is drinking only beer. ... Hall says he's taking a nod from monks in the 1600's that would fast during the season by a bock beer diet. 'Being master brewers, they decided they would take a popular style of beer in Germany, bock beer, make it extra hearty and that would be their liquid bread and that's what they call it,' Hall said. 'So the monks in Bavaria, they would call doppelbock liquid bread and basically it would sustain them through the 46 days of Lent.' ...

"The controversial group's anti-Carlson campaign may be more personal. Carlson previously caused severe credibility issues for Media Matters when, as the founder and editor of The Daily Caller, he released a seminal series of investigative reports in 2012 first exposing controversial Media Matters tactics, including reportedly assembling an enemies list and discussing a plan to possibly investigate the personal lives of Fox News employees.

The Daily Caller series was launched with a news-making piece co-authored by Carlson himself citing internal memos and sources revealing close coordination between Media Matters and the Obama White House, reportedly including holding a weekly strategy call with Obama administration officials.

That piece by Carlson was titled, ""Inside Media Matters: Sources, memos reveal erratic behavior, close coordination with White House and news organizations.""

The investigative report took direct aim at longtime Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, who founded Media Matters seven years earlier. Carlson's article cited sources describing the Media Matters founder as displaying erratic behavior and fostering a workplace environment of paranoia. Some sources described as being in Brock's ""orbit"" even alleged illicit drug use:

Extensive interviews with a number of Brock's current and former colleagues at Media Matters, as well as with leaders from across the spectrum of Democratic politics, reveal an organization roiled by its leader's volatile and erratic behavior and struggles with mental illness, and an office where Brock's executive assistant carried a handgun to public events in order to defend his boss from unseen threats.

...

Friends say Brock, who has publicly admitted drug use in the past, was working obsessively and staying out late with compatriots. ""They'd close [local bars] and party till six in the morning,"" said one. A number of people in Brock's orbit believe he was regularly using illegal drugs, including cocaine. ""It's not like he was trying to keep it a secret,"" says a female friend of Brock's.

Sources back at the Media Matters offices describe an atmosphere of tension and paranoia. ""Many of us lived in fear that at any point we could be fired,"" one said. Brock believed he had received credible death threats, and employed a two-man security detail, at least one of whom was armed and acted as his driver. A new security system was installed in his house. He became concerned that one of his bodyguards was plotting against him.

Carlson's article was followed up by another Daily Caller investigation, this one citing internal Media Matters memos that revealed a comprehensive enemies list.

The Daily Caller reported:

An internal Media Matters For America memo obtained by The Daily Caller reveals that the left-wing media watchdog group employs an ""opposition research team"" to target its political enemies. Included in the list of targets are right-leaning websites, conservative think tanks, prominent financiers and donors, and more than a dozen specific Fox News Channel and News Corporation employees.

""We will conduct extensive public records searches and compile opposition books on individuals,"" declares the memo, likely written in late 2009. Investigations, it says, ""will focus on the backgrounds, connections, operations and political and financial activities of the individuals.""

Yet another Daily Caller expos√© followed, reporting that a Media Matters memo had advocated for a project that would, among other things, investigate the personal lives of Fox News employees.

""We must take Fox News head-on in a well-funded, presidential-style campaign to discredit and embarrass the network, making it illegitimate in the eyes of news consumers,"" the memo read, according to the report.

""We should hire private investigators to look into the personal lives of Fox News anchors, hosts, reporters, prominent contributors, senior network and corporate staff,"" the memo continued.

The Daily Caller's probes of Media Matters received widespread attention within conservative and independent media spheres, including prominent links at the Drudge Report, coverage at Fox News and numerous articles by this reporter.

Carlson himself appeared as a guest on Fox News to discuss his Media Matters investigations.

Fast forward seven years. Media Matters released two attack posts documenting statements about women, Iraqis, and minorities that the organization characterized as offensive. The comments were made by Carlson during regular segments in which he called into the Bubba the Love Sponge Show, a radio program known for wild stunts and politically incorrect cultural and political conversations.

""Media Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago,"" Carlson responded in a statement, suggesting critics are angry because he declined to ""express the usual ritual contrition.""

Carlson opened up his highly-rated Fox News show, ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"", with a seven minute monologue deriding what he described as mob tactics while accusing Democrats of engaging in a ""deadly serious"" campaign to ""crush"" opposing ideologies.

""We've always apologized when we're wrong, and we'll continue to do that,"" Carlson said. ""That's what decent people do. They apologize. But we will never bow to the mob, ever, no matter what.""

""Fox News is behind us, as they have been since the very first day,"" Carlson said. ""Toughness is a rare quality in a TV network, and we're grateful for that.""

Carlson spoke as graphics displayed on the screen read, ""The Mob,"" ""Crackdown on Dissent"" and ""Liberal Hypocrisy.""

The Fox News host criticized Republican politicians as doing ""a fairly credible imitation of an opposition party.""

""But on the deepest level, it's all a pose,"" he said. ""The mob demands a response. Very often, the first people calling for the destruction of that person are Republican leaders. You saw it with the Covington Catholic High School kids. You see it all the time.""

Media Matters is known for deploying controversial tactics against outlets like Fox News, Breitbart and talk radio.

Soros has financed Media Matters, including by providing a $1 million donation in 2010 ""to hold Fox News accountable for the false and misleading information they so often broadcast.

David Brock once described Media Matters as aiming to wage an all-out campaign of ""guerrilla warfare and sabotage"" against Fox News.",375,Breitbart,Revenge? Tucker Carlson Exposed Media Matters' Smear Campaign Against Conservatives in 2012 | Breitbart
"Beto expected to announce bid; reaction from 'Watters' World' host Jesse Watters on 'The Story.'

Beto O'Rourke's headed to Iowa this weekend. He just made the rounds at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin. He's stayed in the headlines with creative, at times unusual, gimmicks like live-streaming his dental appointment and posting soulful blogs from the road.

And ahead of his trip to the state that votes first in the presidential caucus calendar, O'Rourke has launched over 300 Facebook ads touting that he's made his 2020 decision: ""People in communities across the country have been reaching out and asking me if I'm planning on running in 2020. I have made a decision on that. Sign up today to be first to know what's next. I'd like for you to be a part of it.""

O'ROURKE CALLS FOR RIPPING DOWN EXISTING BORDER WALLS

But amid rampant speculation that the former congressman from Texas turned rock star in the eyes of many Democrats is preparing to launch a White House run is concern that the waiting game is taking its toll on his unique brand. As the deadline for O'Rourke to first make a decision and now announce that decision keeps slipping, it's led some party pundits to wonder whether the candidate who nearly ousted conservative GOP Sen. Ted Cruz last November may have missed his moment to capture the Democratic nomination.

Timing is everything in politics - think then-Sen. Barack Obama catching lightning in a bottle as he captured the Democratic presidential nomination and eventually the White House in the 2008 election cycle.

Should O'Rourke have jumped into the race in December or January, when 'Beto mania' was at a fever pitch?

""I do think that Beto O'Rourke's star was much stronger a few months ago and the polls indicate that every week that goes by, that he plays this game, he drops even further,"" said a longtime Democratic consultant, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely.

But veteran Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson strongly disagrees.

""He may win or lose the primary, but it's hard to see any primary voter in winter 2020 voting against him because they held a grudge that he spent too long thinking in winter 2019,"" argued Ferguson, who served as a senior spokesman on the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign but remains neutral this cycle.

""As we watch Trump announce things that don't exist and irrationally react to conspiracy theories, voters won't resent someone who takes the time to be sure about a decision. Being thoughtful isn't a vice, being rash and irrational is,"" he emphasized.

""Anyone claiming it's too late for candidates to jump into the race either has an agenda or is just plain stupid,"" said the strategist, who also asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

Still, the drawn-out pre-announcement period has allowed other big names to dominate the conversation, including numerous high-profile senators who have already declared candidacies as well as former Vice President Joe Biden -- who also has not announced his decision but is polling much better than O'Rourke at this early stage.

O'Rourke's trajectory from here is anyone's guess.

The three-term congressman from El Paso first rose to national attention last summer and autumn, as he challenged Cruz in the 2018 midterm elections. O'Rourke raked in an eye-popping $80 million during his campaign, thanks in part to his uplifting message and his mastery of social media.

He immediately became a Democratic rock star. And like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another darling of the party's progressive base, O'Rourke quickly reached celebrity status, being referenced only by his first name.

O'Rourke narrowly lost to Cruz -- by just over 200,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast. After his better-than-expected performance against the GOP incumbent, there were immediate calls by some Democrats for O'Rourke to run for president.

After saying days after the November elections that ""I will not be a candidate for president in 2020,"" O'Rourke quickly changed his tune, explaining that ""I haven't made any decisions about anything yet.""

By mid-December, he acknowledged at a town hall that he was considering a White House run.

In early January, with Beto mania heating up, O'Rourke live-streamed a visit to his dentist, which while going viral was also greeted with plenty of derision on social media.

Days later, as the Democratic presidential contenders were busy building organizations and making frequent stops in the early voting states, O'Rourke tried to find clarity. So he embarked on a solo road trip across the country, posting rambling dispatches on Medium.

BETO O'ROURKE'S 'PRIVILEGE' MAY BE HURTING HIS WITH WOMEN

That trip came under attack from New York Times reporter Lisa Lerer, who argued that no female politician could get away with O'Rourke's style of exploring a presidential campaign bid.

""Imagine, they say, if Beto were Betsy,"" Lerer wrote in the Times. ""What would the reception have been if a female candidate left her three small children home and spent several weeks traveling the country, posting stream-of-consciousness diary entries? Or if she chose to forgo a Senate race that would provide a greater opportunity for victory?""

O'Rourke, in a much-anticipated early February interview with Oprah Winfrey, said he'd make a 2020 decision ""really soon ... before the end of this month.""

But that deadline came and went.

Two weeks ago came word that O'Rourke had ruled out a 2020 Senate challenge against Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and would announce his decision on a presidential bid ""soon.""

O'Rourke then told reporters that he had made a decision, but remained mum on what he had decided.

""I want to make the announcement to everyone at the same time,"" O'Rourke explained. ""I want to do it the right way.""

This past weekend, the apparent O'Rourke tease continued, as he attended South by Southwest for the premiere of a documentary about his 2018 Senate campaign.

He avoided revealing or detailing his 2020 intentions.

""I want to make sure I do it the right way and I tell everyone at the same time, so I'll be doing that,"" he once again told reporters when questioned about the delay in any announcement. ""I've got to be on the timeline that works for my family and for the country.""

On Monday night, a video from O'Rourke on Twitter indicated that he would head this upcoming weekend to Iowa to lend a hand to a Democratic state Senate candidate running in a special election. The news came as O'Rourke reportedly had started staffing up in the Hawkeye State.

A new national poll from Monmouth University, meanwhile, indicated a slight deterioration in his popularity. O'Rourke enjoyed a 41 percent-9 percent favorable/unfavorable rating in January. Monmouth's latest survey, released on Monday, showed O'Rourke with a 38 percent-12 percent favorable/unfavorable rating.

The longtime consultant critical of his approach argued that by waiting, O'Rourke is ""just going to be one more candidate because he didn't strike when he was hot.""

But others point to a lack of a breakout candidate so far in the large field of Democratic presidential contenders. They argue that a campaign launch by O'Rourke could shake things up.

A consultant who spoke anonymously pointed to Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont topping the Democratic nomination polls, arguing that ""the primary is a complete free-for-all with the two so-called frontrunners artificially inflated by name ID and the fact that their records have yet to be vetted. No one has any idea which candidate is going to ultimately connect with early state voters until they're well into doing it.""",376,Fox News,O'Rourke builds anticipation for 2020 announcement - but will Beto bubble burst?
"Hollywood A-list actor Samuel L. Jackson held nothing back when talking about politics in a new interview, attacking President Donald Trump, his supporters, and the Republican Party.

In an interview with Esquire, Samuel L. Jackson says that he hears the people who called him the N-word as a kid in the voices of President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY):

I always ask people in my family this: Did growing up in segregation make you feel angry?

I don't think I was ever angry about it. I'm angrier now about it than I was then just because I see these guys and I know these are the same guys: Trump and all those assholes, Mitch McConnell. But they're the same fucking guys. And when I hear their voices, I hear the same voices. Those twangs where they didn't specifically call you ""nigger,"" they said ""nigra."" ""The nigras."" There was no doubt about where they stood, that you were never going to be their equal and, if possible, they were going to make sure you never had as much shit as they had. And they were worried about the chasteness of their women, and miscegenation, and not having enough of them, there being more of us than there are of them.

Jackson also attacked President Trump, saying that he is ""ruining the planet.""

""This motherfucker is like ruining the planet and all kinds of other crazy shit,"" the Captain Marvel star said.

""And the people think that's okay. It's not fucking okay. And if you're not saying anything, then you're complicit,"" Jackson continued. ""And I wouldn't give a fuck if I was a garbageman and I had a Twitter account; I'd tweet that shit out. I'm not thinking about who I am and what my job is when I do that shit.""

Finally, the Django Unchained actor declared that he doesn't ""give a fuck"" if fans stop watching his movies because he's vocal about his left-wing political views.

Do you worry about antagonizing fans?

I know how many motherfuckers hate me. ""I'm never going to see a Sam Jackson movie again."" Fuck I care? If you never went to another movie I did in my life, I'm not going to lose any money. I already cashed that check. Fuck you. Burn up my videotapes. I don't give a fuck. ""You're an actor. Stick to acting."" ""No, motherfucker. I'm a human being that feels a certain way."" And some of this shit does affect me, because if we don't have health care, shit, and my relatives get sick, they're going to call my rich ass. I want them to have health care. I want them to be able to take care of themselves. This is how I feel. And I count to one hundred some days before I hit ""send,"" because I know how that shit is.

Indeed, Jackson is not shy about his political opinions. Last month, he openly compared Trump to a plantation slaveholder.

In January, Jackson appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and rapped to Trump, ""No way, Jose! So cut it out, 'cause we ain't no suckers. Cough up the money yourself, you cheap motherfucker.""",377,Breitbart,"Samuel L. Jackson: Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell The 'Same F**king Guys' Who Called Me N-Word As a Kid"
"The House of Commons, Britain's lower legislative chamber, is voting again on whether to accept Theresa May's slightly modified Brexit deal which it already rejected in January.

The vote comes 32 months after the British people voted to leave the European Union by a margin of over a million votes, the largest democratic exercise in British history. The decision was a major upset to the British political class, which all but totally supported keeping the UK inside the EU, and has since been working on Brexit negotiations at near-snail's pace, running down the clock on finding an answer on how to leave the European Union until the very last days until the country is legally mandated to leave the Union.

I profoundly regret the decision this house has taken tonight. I continue to believe that by far the best course of action is the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in an orderly fashion with a deal, and that the deal we've negotiated is the only and best deal available.

Two weeks ago I made a series of commitments from this dispatch box regarding the steps we would take in the event this house rejected the deal on offer. I stand by those commitments in full. Therefore tonight, we will table a motion for a debate tomorrow to test whether the house supports leaving the European Union without a deal on the e29th of March.

This is a matter of grave importance for the future of our country. Just like the referendum, there are strongly held and equally legitimate views on both sides. For that reason, I can confirm that this will be a free vote on this side of the house.

I have personally struggled with this choice... I am passionate about delivering the result of the referendum but I equally passionately believe that the best way to do that is to leave in an orderly way with a deal. And I still believe that there is a majority in the house for that court of action.

I'm conscious also of my duties as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and of the potential damage to the union that leaving without a deal could do, when one part of our country is without devolved government. I can, therefore, confirm the motion will read: 'This House Declines to Approve Leaving the European Union Without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework on the Future Relationship on the 29th March 2019, and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this house and the EU ratify an agreement.

...the government will tomorrow publish information on essential policies which would need to be put in place should we leave without a deal. These will cover our approach to tariffs, and the Northern Ireland border among other matters. If the House votes to leave without a deal on the 29th of March, it will be the policy of the government to implement that decision. If the House declines to approve leaving without a deal on the 29th of March, the government will bring forward a motion on Thursday on whether Parliament wants to seek an extension to article 50.

If the House votes for an extension, the government will seek to agree that extension with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.

But let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension, and this house will have to answer that question.

Does it wish to revoke article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal? These are the unenviable choices, that thanks to the decision that this house made this evening, they are choices that now must be faced.

UPDATE 1930 -- The Prime Minister Speaks

Prime Minister May said that she ""profoundly regrets"" the outcome of the vote, confirming that the government will table a motion for the debate tomorrow whether the house supports leaving the EU without a deal.

May added that that would be a free vote and she would not be whipping MPs to back leaving the EU in a clean break, reiterating she ""passionately believes"" the best way to leave the EU is with a deal and still believes there is a majority in the house to do so.

Leaving without a deal remains the legal default unless the House and EU ratify the agreement, May said. If the house votes to leave without a deal, the government will follow that vote. If it votes against, it will seek a vote on Thursday on extending Article 50, she explained. If Parliament backs an extension, Mrs May she would seek such an extension with the EU.

Mrs May ended by saying, ""Let me be clear: voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problem we face. The EU will want to know what use we want to make of such an extension; and this house will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal? These are the unenviable choice that thanks to the decision that this house made this evening, they are choices that now must be faced.""

The fact tomorrow's vote will be unwhipped means with almost perfect certainty that the House of Commons will vote to reject a no-deal Brexit. Given this is basically the only remaining negotiating position the British government has left -- that it retains the right to walk away from the negotiating table if the European Union won't be reasonable -- this would effectively sign the death warrant of any future improvement in Britain's departure settlement.

UPDATE 1915 -- Theresa May's Brexit deal defeated by 391 to 242 votes

As expected, the Brexit deal derided as a betrayal of Brexit by many has been defeated for a second time, likely by a coalition of anti-Brexit diehards from both sides of the house believing this is the best way to stop Britain leaving the EU, and pro-Brexit members of the ERG who see this as an opportunity to get a better Brexit.

Tonight's vote was basically doomed since the Attorney General published his revised advice on Theresa May's updated deal this morning. While the AG was clearly supportive of the Prime Minister in his writing and statement in the chamber, he concluded that there was not enough change to say the risk of Britain being trapped in a Brexit limbo had vanished.

While this has been anticipated, it does not make it any less of a major seismic event in British politics -- it could not be less clear, very nearly, what will happen with Brexit and the British government now. Will Jeremy Corbyn call a vote of no confidence against May to try and force a general election?

As an aside, an interesting glimpse inside the building where the political sausage is made: potentially breaking Parliamentary conventions on taking photographs inside the chamber and the lobbies, SNP MP Hannah Bardell gave an indication of how packed the no lobby -- where MPs go to vote against the government -- was during the count.

UPDATE 1900 -- Parliament Votes

The Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has defended the government's Brexit deal, to perhaps surprisingly animated cheering from the government benches and boos from the opposition. The Members of the British House of Commons are now filing into the division lobbies to be counted for the vote which will, likely, dictate the future of Brexit and possibly Theresa May's leadership.

The original story continues below...

Broadcaster Sky News, citing their headcount of Members of Parliament who have made their intentions known, predicts that the government will lose by over 100 votes. While this is an improvement in fortunes for the Prime Minister who was defeated by 230 votes in January -- the heaviest defeat of a Prime Minister in modern British political history -- it is still well short of being enough to save May's deal.

Theresa May has threatened that to oppose her deal would, rather than create space for a better deal, jeopardise Brexit itself. While the majority of Members of Parliament voted against the UK leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum, they are also aware that in many cases their electors are majority pro-leave, and hence their promises to execute the will of the electorate may be threatened by the Prime Minister's claim.

Among those rejecting that is key Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said Tuesday that May's claim was merely a ""phantom"" meant to scare, and ""...it is safe to vote against this deal again tonight and look to leaving on the 29th of March without a deal.""

While Parliament passing May's deal Tuesday would lead Britain to a Brexit of sorts, it has been decried as a betrayal of the spirit of the Brexit vote, and a 'Brexit in name only' by critics. Brexit leader Nigel Farage has called it ""the worst deal in history"", and said what she's arranged came only after years of Brexit delays and betrayals.

What the government being defeated a second time on its Brexit deal will mean is not exactly clear, but there are several routes forward being discussed. Most immediate are the associated further votes in the coming days promised by Theresa May if her deal was defeated -- one to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and the other to cancel the legal date for Brexit to extend negotiation time.

As MPs are expected to defeat May, they would almost certainly also vote against a so-called no deal -- the option of actually unilaterally, fully leaving the European Union and all its associated bodies is one treated with horror by most MPs despite it being the most popular option for the British public -- and then to suspend Brexit, too.

Westminster is also alive, once again, with discussion over the future of the Prime Minister as well. Labour may table a vote of no confidence in the government, but it is unclear whether even the hardest of Tory rebels would vote for a general election.

While Theresa May herself is theoretically safe from a leadership contest from her own party, as Conservative rules mean only one can take place every 12 months, she may also feel unable to lead the party further following tonight's vote.

"Facebook temporarily blocked users from posting articles from finance and politics blog Zero Hedge this week, calling the blacklisting a ""mistake.""

Zero Hedge, which often publishes critical articles about Big Tech companies including Facebook, reported on Monday that the social network had been blocking users from posting its articles.

""Over the weekend, we were surprised to learn that some readers were prevented by Facebook when attempting to share Zero Hedge articles,"" the blog reported. ""Subsequently it emerged that virtually every attempt to share or merely mention an article, including in private messages, would be actively blocked by the world's largest social network, with the explanation that 'the link you tried to visit goes against our community standards.'""

""We were especially surprised by this action as neither prior to this seemingly arbitrary act of censorship, nor since, were we contacted by Facebook with an explanation of what 'community standard' had been violated or what particular filter or article had triggered the blanket rejection of all Zero Hedge content,"" Zero Hedge explained, adding, ""it is just as possible that Facebook simply decided to no longer allow its users to share our content in retaliation for our extensive coverage of what some have dubbed the platform's 'many problems', including chronic privacy violations, mass abandonment by younger users, its gross and ongoing misrepresentation of fake users, ironically - in retrospect - its systematic censorship and back door government cooperation (those are just links from the past few weeks).""

Public figures, including Infowars Editor-at-Large Paul Joseph Watson and Thiel Capital Managing Director Eric Weinstein, also reported problems with posting Zero Hedge links.

The block prompted condemnation from President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., MEP Nigel Farage, and others, with Trump Jr. declaring, ""The censorship continues. How does ‚Å¶@zerohedge‚Å©'s content not 'meet community standards?' FB doesn't agree with them and they hit the platform's obvious flaws at times. That's it and it's disgusting!""

""This is a total disgrace,"" posted Farage, while journalist Ben Norton expressed, ""This is a huge threat to civil liberties.""

The Facebook block, however, was eventually reversed, with a Facebook spokesman claiming the problem was a ""mistake.""

""This was a mistake with our automation to detect spam and we worked to fix it yesterday,"" claimed the spokesman. ""We use a combination of human review and automation to enforce our policies around spam and in this case, our automation incorrectly blocked this link. As soon as we identified the issue, we worked quickly to fix it.""

As reported by Bloomberg, ""Since being founded in the depths of the financial crisis, Zero Hedge has built a dedicated following by serving up a mix of hardcore financial analysis and populist political commentary,"" and the blog is ""known for its bearish bent and anti-establishment commentary.""

"Former Vice President Biden will run for president against President Donald Trump, according to a senior House Democrat lawmaker in the last week.

Biden reportedly called the House lawmaker and asked if he could discuss campaign strategy with the congressman and invited the member to sit down with him shortly. The former vice president also asked the lawmaker for his support, which the member did not say he could give at this time.

Biden and his wife, Jill, just came back from vacation in the Caribbean, where they allegedly discussed potential problems if he were to run for president.

Bill Russo, a Biden spokesman, said that the former Delaware senator has not announced his decision yet.

""He has not made a final decision. No change,"" Russo said.

At an event with firefighters on Tuesday, Biden allegedly teased a presidential run as the crowded chanted, Run, Joe, run!""

""I appreciate the energy you all showed when I got up here,"" Biden said at the International Association of Fire Fighters' annual conference in Washington, D.C. ""Save it a little longer, I may need it in a few weeks. Be careful what you wish for.""

A source familiar with Biden's thinking suggested that Biden often likes to ""check all boxes"" before he officially announces his decision.

""He's basically in. He's just running the traps, as he says,"" the source said.

Biden, 76-years-old and older than President Trump, could announce his third and final presidential bid as soon as the next couple weeks.

A recent Monmouth University poll had Biden leading Democrat presidential contenders at 28 percent, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in second at 25 percent, followed by Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA) at ten percent, and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at eight percent.

However, Biden's age and moderate politics may serve as a disadvantage if he were to come into the Democrat presidential primary fray as many younger, more diverse, and more progressive candidates have embraced proposals such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.

Biden's team also recently hired Cristobal Alex, the former head of the Latino Victory Fund, who ran the controversial ad during the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial campaign which featured a white Donald Trump supporter attempting to run down minority children.

Antoine Lewis, 40, of Matteson, Ill., was a passenger on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 when the jetliner crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people onboard, according to Matteson Mayor Sheila Chalmers-Currin.

""I was devastated. Shocked and devastated,"" she told FOX32. ""He was a humanitarian, a faith-driven man.""

Lewis was in Africa doing Christian missionary work at the time of the air disaster. The 40-year-old enlisted in the army as a third-generation family member before going on to serve in Afghanistan, WGN reported.

His father, Rodney Lewis, told WLS-TV he was stationed in Ottawa before leaving to go to Ethiopia.

""He was also stationed in South Korea, he was a military man, he loved it, he was moving up through the military,"" he said. ""He went in as an enlisted man and he got his undergraduate degree and his graduate degree.""

Lewis had planned to start a business or charity and build a home in Africa following his retirement from the military in a few years, according to family members. He leaves behind a wife and 15-year-old son.

One last trip before fatherhood turns deadly

Brothers Mel and Bennett Riffel were on one last adventure before Mel was expecting to become a father in May when they were killed in the crash.

The brothers from Redding, Calif. had been in Australia before visiting Africa, Redding Chamber of Commerce President Jake Mangas told the Record Searchlight. Mangas said he is close friends with the brothers' parents, Ike and Susan Riffel.

""Our family is devastated for Ike and Susan and certainly for Melvin's wife, Brittney,"" Mangas told the newspaper. ""They are wonderful, faith-filled people and if there is any encouragement to me, it's in this difficult circumstance, I know they are surrounded by a community that loves them very much.""

Parishioners at St. Joseph Church and School spent Monday placing flowers in the brothers' memory. Both attended the church elementary school and their mother is the parish secretary, according to KRCR-TV.

A man originally from New Jersey who worked for a company that develops air quality products was also among the dead.

Matt Vecere grew up in Sea Isle City and studied ocean engineering at the Florida Institute of Technology. He later moved back to New Jersey when he transferred to Stockton University, FOX29 reported.

In 2005, Vecere moved to California, where he was living at the time of the crash while working for IQ Air, a Swiss-based company that develops air quality products. In a statement posted to Twitter, the company said it was ""greatly saddened by the loss of our friend and colleague.""

"WASHINGTON - President Trump's campaign on Tuesday called on his Democratic challengers for 2020 to say whether they support House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's stance against impeachment.

""Every single Democrat running for president should be made to answer: do they agree with the Speaker who stands in opposition to baseless impeachment charges, or will they risk fracturing the country by bowing to the radical elements in their party who want to disenfranchise the American people and overturn the legitimate and lawful result of the last election?"" said Trump campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

Pelosi made waves Monday when she told the Washington Post that she was ""not for impeachment.""

""I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he's just not worth it,"" she said.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), one of the Democratic contenders, was quick to say that she wasn't shutting the door on impeachment.

""I want to look at the Mueller report before I make a decision about whether I believe he should or should not be impeached,"" she told reporters outside the Capitol on Monday night.

But like many of her fellow 2020 hopefuls, she preached caution -- or disinterest.

""I would like to see this president and the style of politics that he represents sent off through the electoral process, decisively defeated at the ballot box,"" said South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg Sunday night at a CNN presidential town hall.

A spokeswoman for the 37-year-old 2020 contender pointed to that remark when asked specifically about Pelosi's comments.

Some progressives are still pursuing impeachment -- but wouldn't criticize Pelosi.

""I am beginning the investigation,"" Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said Tuesday. ""That doesn't mean we're voting on it. It means we're beginning the process to look at some of these alleged crimes, these impeachable offenses.""

Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) also wouldn't rebuke Pelosi when he vowed to reintroduce new articles of impeachment.

""There will be another vote on the floor of the Congress of the United States of America,"" Green told reporters in his office Tuesday.

""There were 66 people last time [who voted for it]. If I had to guess now and give you a prognostication given the way the opinion makers and opinion shakers have handled this, my guess is they've done a pretty good job among the members and you probably won't get 66,"" the Texas Democrat said.

Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who was among those who voted alongside Green last year, called the congressman's push ""premature"" and said he didn't know if he could vote with him again for impeachment.

"Dissenters from campus orthodoxy often need a rare kind of personal fortitude.

Last October, Sarah Lawrence College professor Samuel Abrams wrote an important and insightful essay in the New York Times. While critics of higher education have often focused on faculty bias -- in part because a small subset of professors is prone to say ridiculous things -- a larger problem has gone mostly unnoticed. Abrams's research revealed that college administrators are more uniformly progressive even than college faculties. ""Liberal staff members,"" he wrote, ""outnumber their conservative counterparts by the astonishing ratio of 12-to-one,"" making them the ""most left-leaning group on campus.""

At the conclusion of his piece, Abrams made an argument that rang true to my more than 20 years of litigation experience -- ""ideological imbalance, coupled with [administrators'] agenda-setting power, threatens the free and open exchange of ideas.""

This is exactly right. Administrators draft and enforce speech codes. Administrators are responsible for creating campus kangaroo courts. Administrators kick Christian student groups off campus, and administrators often take the lead in designing campus programming that features overwhelmingly progressive voices. While conservative media often focus their ire on random radical professors, administrators are busy engaging in the overwhelming majority of campus censorship.

Simply put, Abrams told an important truth. And he's been punished for it. As our Madeleine Kearns reported last November, his office door was vandalized, students called for him to be punished, anonymous individuals falsely accused him of sexual misconduct, and when Abrams urged the college president, Cristle Judd, to take a strong stand in favor of academic freedom, he said that she ""asked whether he thought it was appropriate to write op-eds without her permission and further suggested that his article had been hostile toward his colleagues.""

It turns out that Abrams's ordeal isn't over. Yesterday, a group of students calling themselves the ""Diaspora Coalition"" began a sit-in and issued an extraordinary set of demands, including demands aimed directly at Abrams. The protesters called on the college to ""confront how the presence of Sam Abrams . . . affects the safety and wellbeing of marginalized students."" And they wrote this paragraph, which must be seen to be believed:

On October 16, 2018, politics professor Samuel Abrams published an op-ed entitled ""Think Professors Are Liberal? Try School Administrators"" in The New York Times. The article revealed the anti-Blackness, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-woman bigotry of Abrams. The article specifically targeted programs such as the Our Liberation Summit, which Abrams did not attend, facilitated by the Office of Diversity and Campus Engagement. The Sarah Lawrence community deserves an administration that strives for an inclusive education that reflects the diversity of our community. Abrams' derision of the Black Lives Matter, queer liberation, and women's rights movements displays not only ignorance but outright hostility towards the essential efforts to dismantle white supremacy and other systems of oppression. This threatens the safety and wellbeing of marginalized people within the Sarah Lawrence community by demonstrating that our lives and identities are viewed as ""opinions"" that we can have a ""difference in dialogue"" about, as if we haven't been forced to debate our very existences for our entire lives. We demand that Samuel Abrams' position at the College be put up to tenure review to a panel of the Diaspora Coalition and at least three faculty members of color. In addition, the College must issue a statement condemning the harm that Abrams has caused to the college community, specifically queer, Black, and female students, whilst apologizing for its refusal to protect marginalized students wounded by his op-ed and the ignorant dialogue that followed. Abrams must issue a public apology to the broader SLC community and cease to target Black people, queer people, and women. (Emphasis in original.)

Crazed student demands are not new on American campuses. Outrageous mischaracterizations of opposing views are par for the course (really, read Abrams's essay and see if he's guilty of any of the charges against him). Yet matters get more alarming when professors and presidents take radicals seriously. Reportedly, the president of the college has already met twice with the protesters, and 25 professors have signed a petition declaring they ""stand in solidarity with the student activism happening this week.""

Years ago, when I'd speak about the larger dangers of the campus culture wars, I'd often hear adults dismiss my concerns by confidently stating that these students would ""grow up"" when they encountered the harsh and unforgiving ""real world."" Well, campus radicals have encountered the ""real world,"" and they're remaking it in their own oppressive image.

The call-out culture has migrated from campus to corporations, and now everyday Americans live in fear that their words -- even words uttered in good faith and with great respect -- can cost them their livelihoods. And on campus, dissenters from campus orthodoxy often need not just tenure but a rare kind of personal fortitude, including the ability to withstand repeated calls for their termination, repeated disruptions of their work, and sometimes even outright slander.

Publishing truthful information about ideological imbalances threatens no one's ""safety."" Questioning the priorities of progressive administrators endangers no one's ""wellbeing."" Colleges should not ""protect"" anyone from New York Times essays. And the fact that even a syllable of this nonsense is taken seriously by professional academics indicates that our culture of free speech is already in decline.",384,nationalreview.com,"A Professor Spoke the Truth, He Still Pays the Price | National Review"

"Former Vice President Joe Biden dropped a major hint on Tuesday that he'll likely launch a Democratic presidential campaign in the coming weeks.

Biden was greeted with chants of ""run Joe, run"" as he took the podium in Washington, D.C. at the annual convention of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) union. Many in the crowd also were waving 'Run, Joe, Run,' and 'Fire Fighters for Biden' signs.

A few minutes later, during his keynote address, Biden said: ""I appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here. Save it a little longer. I may need it in a few weeks.""

""Be careful what you wish for,"" Biden joked. ""Be careful what you wish for.""

Biden - who represented Delaware in the Senate for nearly four decades before becoming vice president under President Barack Obama - has been moving closer and closer to launching what would be his third bid for the White House.

Sources familiar with the planning of Biden's inner circle last week confirmed to Fox News that top advisers to the former vice president are getting their ducks in a row, figuring out a campaign structure and reaching out to veteran Democratic operatives who would be involved. Those sources pointed to a likely April campaign launch.

An endorsement by the politically powerful IAFF also is likely in the works.

The IAFF, which represents more than 300,000 workers, has had a long and friendly relationship with Biden, dating back to his years in the Senate. And the union's longtime general president Harold Schaitberger has been very vocal about his desire to see Biden run for the White House again.

Biden praised the firefighters in the audience, saying ""there is really literally no group of men or women I'd rather stand with than all of you.""

""You are the heart and soul, the sinew and the backbone of this country,"" he emphasized.

During his address, the former vice president made a spirited pitch for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. The fund, which was opened in 2011 and compensates for the deaths and illnesses of people - including many first responders - due to exposure to toxins at the sites of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, has seen it payouts cut by as much as 70 percent.

""It must be permanently funded. Period!"" Biden argued.

Biden went on to say that ""I think about that time after 9/11 a lot these days. We were so united,"" as he lamented the current state of politics. ""Today we seem to be at each other's throats. ... Mean pettiness has overtaken politics.""

"LONDON -- Pro-Brexit British lawmakers were deciding Tuesday whether last-minute changes to Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal were enough to overcome their opposition to her plan to lead the U.K. out of the European Union.

The House of Commons is due to vote later on the divorce deal, a day after talks with the EU produced assurances that a contentious section of the agreement couldn't be used to tie Britain to the bloc indefinitely -- and less than three weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29.

Lawmakers defeated May's deal by a whopping 230 votes in January, and it's far from clear whether the changes would be enough to persuade enough to change their minds. May says the changes are legally binding, but Brexiteer politicians still need convincing.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox dealt a blow to May's hopes with a legal opinion saying the changes ""reduce the risk"" Britain could be stuck inside EU regulations indefinitely -- but did not eliminate it. The two-page opinion said the U.K. could still not extract itself from the deal unilaterally, a key demand of pro-Brexit British politicians.

Cox said that if U.K.-EU negotiations became stalled through ""intractable differences,"" Britain would have ""no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol's arrangements, save by agreement.""

The pound, which had risen on hopes the deal would be passed, slumped by more than 1 percent against the dollar after Cox's assessment, to trade at $1.3014.

Even before Cox gave his opinion, leading pro-Brexit Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg expressed skepticism.

""I'm not sure that the agreements with the EU are a major change,"" he said.

Other EU nations welcomed the overnight agreement, and urged British politicians to seize the chance to back the deal and ensure an orderly departure.

German EU affairs minister Michael Roth, called it ""a far-reaching compromise."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in a Twitter message that he was ""pleased with the agreement,"" adding: ""An orderly #Brexit is crucial for both the EU and the UK. There is no alternative.""

But the main opposition Labour Party maintained its opposition to the deal. Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer expressed skepticism about whether May had won substantive concessions.

""Having studied the documents, I would be surprised if they are sufficient to enable the Attorney General to change the central plank of his December legal advice,"" Starmer said on Twitter.

May flew to Strasbourg, France, late Monday for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. At a news conference following the meeting, they announced changes designed to overcome lawmakers' concerns about provisions designed to ensure the border between EU member Ireland and Britain's Northern Ireland remains open after Brexit.

The mechanism, known as the backstop, is a safeguard that would keep the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent new trading relationship is in place. Brexit supporters in Britain fear the backstop could be used to bind the country to EU regulations indefinitely.

May said documents to be added to the deal provided ""legally binding"" assurances that the backstop would be temporary and that Britain would have a way to get out of it if the EU failed to negotiate in good faith. The two sides also agreed to continue working on technology that would do away with the need for border checks. However, the text of the 585-page withdrawal agreement remains unchanged.

""Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and deliver on the instruction of the British people,"" May said.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the deal agreed Monday night provided ""additional clarity, reassurance and guarantees sought by some to eliminate doubt or fears, however unreal, that the goal was to trap the U.K. indefinitely in the backstop.

""It is not, these doubts and fears can be put to bed,"" he said.

The EU warned British politicians that negotiations will not be reopened if Parliament rejects the deal again.

""In politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what you do with this second chance that counts. Because there will be no third chance,"" Juncker said

""Let's be crystal clear about the choice: it is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all,"" he said.

If Parliament throws out May's deal again on Tuesday, lawmakers will vote over the following two days on whether to leave the EU without an agreement -- an idea likely to be rejected -- or to ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond the scheduled March 29 departure date.

Some British lawmakers underscored that warning, telling their Brexit-backing colleagues that rejecting the deal could lead to Britain's departure being postponed indefinitely.

""Today is our Hotel California moment. If we don't check out tonight, we may never leave,"" tweeted Conservative legislator Bob Seely.",388,New York Post,Theresa May's Brexit deal faces new vote with UK lawmakers
"Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic Getty Images for The Laver Cup

Roger Federer revealed he was stood up by World No. 1 Novak Djokovic over the controversial decision to ax ATP Tour boss Chris Kermode.

The war that has been playing out in the backroom of men's tennis -- and was brought into the spotlight at the Australian Open in January -- came to a messy ending Friday, when it was announced Kermode would not be extending his six-year term at the helm.

The Players Council -- led by Novak Djokovic -- voted Kermode out, and while Djokovic has refused to confirm publicly whether he spearheaded the charge to get rid of the ATP leader, reports have widely claimed the Serb was the driving force behind the change.

In his first public media opportunity at Indian Wells, Federer refused to discuss Djokovic's role specifically, but piled pressure on the council as a whole to explain the decision to slash the tour's chief executive.

Speaking after his win over Peter Gojowczyk at the tournament, Federer took his thinly veiled criticism of the council and Djokovic a step further when he revealed the Serbian star balked on a meeting with the Swiss ace in the lead-up to Kermode's sacking in a bombshell player revolt.

Federer even suggested in his Swiss press conference that he may consider returning to the governance side of the ATP Tour because he is concerned by recent developments.

One of his biggest concerns is that Djokovic and the rest of the council have not communicated why they decided to swing the ax. Despite both players arriving at Indian Wells before the weekend, they still have not met up.

""I tried to meet Novak on the deadline [before the meeting],"" Federer said. ""Unfortunately he had no time. That's hard to understand for me. He certainly had a lot to do with the whole story. I asked him if he had time to meet me, it was so busy. He suggested that we see each other the day after -- but everything was already decided. We have not met yet and the tournament has started.""

He said he and Rafael Nadal are concerned that the council hasn't publicly defended the decision to look for a new Tour boss.

""It's just important that I know why it happened, and what should happen now,"" Federer said. ""I want to know what the motive was. What it is Kermode does not seem to have done well. I would have tended to be more for him. In the past, there were always situations in which one had to say, 'He or she just has to go' -- but that was not the case with Kermode. Only politics is in turmoil.

""I also talked to Rafa. We are on the same page, that's important to him and me. Many were behind Kermode. Not all have the same priorities. Some think primarily of money, others of the tournament calendar, others are more concerned with power, that's always a big story. I still have the feeling the tour is going well, we have great matches, the prize money went up, the stadiums are full.""

Federer stepped down as the ATP Tour Council president in 2014, but he suggested he may look to make a comeback over how Kermode's sacking has been handled.

""It is hard for me to express a clear opinion because I am no longer politically active,"" Federer said. ""I'm already interested in what's behind it, why it happened like that. I have to think about whether I should get more involved again in the future, for the sake of the tour. Or if I should just get involved a bit instead of going through politics.""

Some stars like Players Council member Vasek Pospisil wanted Kermode gone, but others such as Stan Wawrinka and Nadal were firmly against the change in leadership because they believe men's tennis has been booming in recent years.

In public, Federer had previously stayed out of the debate and distanced himself from any talk about pushing for Kermode's removal. Federer also said he's worried those leading the sport don't have a clear idea of where they want to go or how they plan to get there.

""I'm not quite sure to be honest,"" Federer told journalists Leif Shiras and Jon Wertheim on The Tennis Channel when asked what the future of tennis looks like. ""We're in a very interesting time where we need to have a clear plan and I'm not sure what the plan is. That's the big thing I worry about. I do believe we have unbelievable players, great matches, new guys coming through, stadiums are full, prize money has gone up. Everything's great, it seems like.

""From that standpoint everything's actually great and then you talk about politics and you're like, 'Oh my God, what's going on here?' We need to really figure it out and I'd like to feel the pulse a little bit about where we're about to go, because clearly we're going to need to decide who the new CEO [of the ATP] is going to be, or the political side of the game has got to do that.""

Nadal has been a vocal critic of those demanding a leadership change at the ATP, saying just last week Kermode had done a ""good job"" and deserved to stay on. He also warned any drastic changes could derail the path tennis is on and risk future prosperity and growth.

Nadal raised those concerns after earlier complaining at the Australian Open nobody from the Players Council had even bothered to reach out to him and ask for his thoughts on Kermode or the state of the sport.

The Spaniard's pleas clearly fell on deaf ears but he's found a willing ally in Federer, who said the pair shared coffee at his house soon after Kermode was dumped to digest the political upheaval and discuss what lay ahead.

Federer said he and Nadal were on the same page when it came to wanting more clarity.

""What I am happy about is we're aligned and we agree that we should be talking and coming up with a proper plan,"" Federer said of their meeting. ""I'd like to hear that from the council and some more players and people just to get an idea what's really going on, to be quite honest.""",389,New York Post,Roger Federer fuming at Novak Djokovic in high-stakes ATP Tour feud

""The fear of being cast with damning labels and feeling ostracized is genuine for conservatives on campus,"" Zheng said. ""It's also why 55.1 percent of Republicans are closet conservatives who don't tend to share their political orientation with their friends. For Democrats, being part of a college campus that mostly shares their views could be what contributes to feeling accepted in inner and wider circles.""

The survey comes about two weeks after a suspect in the UC-Berkeley attack was taken into custody.

UTAH STUDENT 'FEELS BAD' FOR TEACHER WHO MADE HIM TAKE OFF ASH WEDNESDAY CROSS

Zachary Greenberg, 28, was arrested by university police March 1 after a judge issued an arrest warrant in the Feb. 19 attack on Hayden Williams, the school's public affairs department said in a statement.

Arrest records from the sheriff's office say Greenberg was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and attempting to cause great bodily injury.

The arrest came on the same day that officials decided to reopen the investigation, which had initially concluded a week earlier.

Williams, 26, who is not a student at the university but is a field representative for the conservative group The Leadership Institute, was approached by two men who, he said, reacted with antagonism to his signs. One of them is said to have punched Williams several times. The recruitment table was knocked over and several signs were ripped, according to a UC-Berkeley alert posted to its website. Williams told Fox News last week his attacker also threatened to shoot him.

The attack sparked outrage on social media over what many critics saw as the university's largely muted and delayed response to the footage of the attack.

"British Prime Minister Theresa May is hoping recent revisions to her Brexit deal will finally persuade the British Parliament to pledge their support on Tuesday, nearly two months after suffering the largest defeat in House of Commons history.

May has been pushing a plan that lists the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union for more than two years -- since the country's historic 2016 referendum that resulted in the decision to depart the E.U. In January, members of Parliament voted 432-202 against May's deal, said to be the largest defeat in House of Commons history.

The House of Commons is once again due to vote on the divorce deal later Tuesday, a day after talks with the E.U. produced assurances that a contentious section of the agreement couldn't be used to tie Britain to the bloc indefinitely.

THERESA MAY FACES CATASTROPHIC DEFEAT IN MAJOR BREXIT VOTE AS ALLIES WARN: 'WINTER IS COMING'

Time is running out: Britain is due to leave the E.U. on March 29. It's possible the country could leave the bloc without a deal, which economists have warned could have devastating effects on the British economy. But May believes new legally binding tweaks to her Brexit deal will be enough to secure the votes she needs to pass the bill.

""In politics sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with that second chance that counts. There will be no third chance.""

-- Jean-Claude Juncker

However, the deal continues to face deep opposition from both sides of Britain's divide over Europe.

""In politics sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with that second chance that counts. There will be no third chance,"" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, recently told the BBC.

Here's what you need to know about Brexit and the departure agreement.

Brexit -- or ""British Exit"" -- refers to the U.K.'s choice to leave the E.U., which is an ""economic and political partnership"" that currently consists of 28 countries in Europe, according to the BBC.

A list of countries that are part of the E.U. can be found here.

May and other U.K. leaders have worked with the E.U. to negotiate and agree on the terms of the country's exit from the E.U., which will occur on March 29 whether or not there is a deal, the BBC reported.

Negotiations between the two sides have led to a 585-page withdrawal agreement. The agreement, in part, details the terms of the U.K.'s departure from the E.U.

Namely, this includes how much money the U.K. is required to pay the E.U., (estimated ¬£39 billion or more than $49 billion), what will happen to the E.U. citizens living in the U.K. and vice versa, and how to prevent a physical 310-mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""when it becomes the frontier between the U.K. and the E.U.,"" the BBC reported. This has also been referred to as the ""backstop plan.""

UK GOVERNMENT CLAIMS TO WIN BREXIT DEAL CHANGES IN LAST-MINUTE TALKS

The E.U. says that there can be no deal without the backstop to guarantee an open border along the U.K.'s only land frontier with an E.U. member state. But pro-Brexit supporters say this part of the agreement will bind the U.K. to many E.U. laws, CNBC previously reported.

Since her devastating defeat in January, May said she's secured a joint declaration from the European Union, U.K. and Northern Ireland that ""commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements"" by the end of 2020, according to the BBC.

""The Parties recall their determination to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland by a subsequent agreement that establishes alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing,"" the March political declaration states.

Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington says changes to a portion of the deal regarding the Irish border should overcome lawmakers' concerns about a mechanism in the deal designed to keep an open border between Britain's Northern Ireland and E.U. member Ireland.

The new guarantee ""provides confirmation that the E.U. cannot try to trap the U.K. in the backstop indefinitely,"" Lidington explained.

Members of the British Parliament will vote on May's updated Brexit deal around 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

If the vote is passed then the U.K. will leave the E.U. with a deal on March 29.

If the vote is rejected again then Parliament will vote on Wednesday to determine whether the U.K. should leave without a deal. If approved, the U.K. would exit without a deal on March 29. If Parliament doesn't agree to the ""no deal"" option then members would vote again Thursday on delaying the Brexit plan. If members disagree over the delay, the U.K. would leave the E.U. without a deal. But if they do vote for a delay, then May would have to ask the E.U. for an extension beyond the scheduled March 29 departure date.

May warned last week that any delay could mean ""we may never leave the EU at all.""

HARDCORE BREXIT GROUP WON'T BACK MAY'S DEAL

Alan Wager, a Brexit expert at the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank, said Parliament this week could decisively rule out both May's deal and a no-deal departure.

That, in turn, would make such options as a new Brexit referendum or a ""softer"" withdrawal from the EU lot more likely, he said.

""Finally, the House of Commons is going to have to make a final judgment on what it wants in terms of Brexit,"" he said.

The transition period is a period of time between March 29 and Dec. 21, 2020 that will allow businesses to adjust to the new rules between the U.K. and E.U. after Brexit formally begins.

But the transition period will only occur if a deal is met between the E.U. and U.K.

"Rep. Ilhan Omar suggested that President Trump is not ""human"" when questioned about her criticisms about the commander-in-chief and former President Barack Obama.

The freshman Democrat from Minnesota assailed Obama's stance on immigration in an interview published Friday by Politico, telling the news outlet that his administration was responsible for the ""caging of kids"" along the US-Mexico border.

When asked by a Fox News reporter Monday whether she thought ""Obama is the same as President Trump,"" she said, ""Absolutely not. That is silly to even equate the two. One is human and one is really not.""

In an audio recording of the Politico interview Omar tweeted over the weekend, she said, ""I think for many of us, we think of ourselves as Democrats. But many of the ways that our Democratic leaders have conducted themselves within the system is not one that we are all proud of.

"" ... And when we talk about waking people up from complacency, it's to say that we can't be only upset with Trump because he's not a politician who sells us his policies in the most perfect way. His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was.""

Omar later blamed Politico reporter Tim Alberta of twisting her words.

""Exhibit A of how reporters distort words. I'm an Obama fan! I was saying how Trump is different from Obama, and why we should focus on policy, not politics. This is why I always tape my interviews,"" she said in her tweet, which she later deleted when it apparently confirmed her statement, according to Fox News.

"I wrote a book, The Case for Trump, in an effort -- as an outsider who has no career investment in Trump and has never met him or visited the Trump White House -- to analyze how and why Donald J. Trump was elected president and why his agenda so far has been successful. One Gabriel Schoenfeld has just published a hysterical attack on that effort in the Bill Kristol-Charles Sykes new Bulwark, and it is emblematic of that venue's promised Never Trump ad hominem assault on individual supporters of the president. A writer for The Atlantic recently interviewed Sykes, noting:

But in the coming months, he [Sykes] tells me, The Bulwark will home in on a specific class of ""grifters and trolls"" -- those opportunistic Trump enablers who still get invited on Meet the Press and write for prestigious newspapers. To Sykes, these are the true sellouts, and he wants to ensure that their public flirtations with Trumpism leave a stench on them.

Though wishing to leave ""a stench on them,"" Schoenfeld instead gives us a sad exercise in self-abasement. And his review offers an illustration of the poverty of Never Trump personal venom and incoherence.

In his review, Schoenfeld tosses out names such as Carl Schmitt and Martin Heidegger, the Third Reich Jew-haters in service to Hitler, to suggest, with a wink and nod, that I play a comparable role in relation to Trump.

Schoenfeld certainly has an odd sense of timing. The same day that Schoenfeld, an adjunct Hudson fellow, leveled his smears in The Bulwark, I was speaking at his own home Hudson Institute about the book. I discussed, among other things, Trump's support for Israel and the dangerous anti-Semitic drift of the Democratic party, a theme I repeated again that evening on television. I guess by dropping the names of Nazi sympathizers Schoenfeld wants to imply that I am anti-Semitic (how odd from a former supportive editor of Commentary, where I have authored a number of essays) -- an unhinged trope that he ran into the ground in the past, especially in despicable attacks against Trump supporters such as Roger Kimball.

In amateurish praeteritio style, after indirectly comparing me to Third Reich anti-Semites, and in general to those who praised Stalin, Hitler, and Mao, Schoenfeld then clears his throat and says he is not really saying that I am a Stalinist, a Nazi, or a genocidal Maoist. As a two-bit practitioner of apophasis, he claims he referenced such names, you see, only to suggest there is a long tradition of traitors (such as myself) of the intellectual class who abased themselves in writing propaganda.

And again, what was my Nazi-like thought crime?

I offered an analysis of how Donald Trump, despite often crude rhetoric and behavior, won the primary and general election of 2016, and for his first two years, enacted a successful agenda of economic growth and foreign-policy recalibration while ensuring superb judicial picks and seeking to address the stagnation of the American interior.

Schoenfeld concedes that in explaining the conditions of Trump's rise, The Case for Trump offers a ""compelling"" account of the progressive disdain for the red-state and rural interior.

But what he conveniently does not tell his readers is that I also presented a far more disturbing account of what some so-called Never Trumpers have said and written about rural and working-class Americans. Whereas elite leftists harbor a snobbish disdain for the working classes, they have not, to my knowledge, like an array of bitter Never Trumpers, dreamed of swapping out their fellow ""deplorable"" Americans for immigrants, both legal and illegal, arriving en masse. I suppose such a population exchange would be their ideal revenge on millions of clingers for ignoring a year of Never Trump screeds that had zero effect on Republican voters in 2016.

Schoenfeld further insinuates that I am a racist for not calling out Donald Trump's alleged bigotry. For a supposed racist enabler, I have an odd way of living -- in the house where I was raised in an impoverished multiracial rural community, part of an extended family that is far from exclusively ""white,"" and teaching for over 20 years at a state university attended mostly by minority students, many from communities near my home. If advocating melting-pot policies of assimilation, integration, and intermarriage -- and living in minority neighborhoods and putting one's children in underperforming but diverse public schools -- is also proof of past ""service to a genuine evil,"" I plead guilty.

More important, Trump's economic agenda has done far more for minority job seekers than have the policies of past Republican or Democratic presidents. Unlike many of his opponents in the Democratic party, Trump does not deprecate Catholicism. He has been on the forefront in calling out the new generation of progressive anti-Semites in Congress. No president has been more adamantly opposed to abortion on demand, which has devastated the African-American community, and which a number of black leaders have called black ""genocide,"" and whose effects in the past have earned either at best liberal assent or at worst outright progressive support for eugenics. In 2020, for all those reasons and others, Trump may well receive a higher percentage of the black, Hispanic, and Jewish vote than, for example, Mitt Romney in 2012.

As for Schoenfeld's sillier suggestion that I am racist for not deploring Trump's policy of following the law that resulted in temporary family separations at the border, he, of course, omits my references in the book to Barack Obama's early ""sent back"" warnings: ""Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they'll get sent back."" Nor does he note that I cite Hillary Clinton's similar warning: ""We have to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So, we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.""

I offered such quotes to remind readers that children were long ago being cynically used by adults to obtain illegal entry for themselves and others, and that both Obama and Clinton were willing to send children home if it deterred them from trying to illegally cross again. In short, that families seeking to enter the U.S. illegally by knowingly abusing refugee loopholes would themselves suffer consequences was a pre-Trump progressive warning -- and to such an extent that Obama was broadcasting that the U.S. would send unescorted children back on their own.

I wish that Schoenfeld, when he was a self-described adviser to the 2012 Romney campaign, had been so indignant about the plight of illegal aliens already here. Amid the various political flip-flops and gyrations of that failed effort, the Romney campaign at one time advocated an unworkable plan of sending some 11-20 million illegal aliens home en masse, to stand in line and reapply legally for visas. Had a President Romney enacted such ""back of the line"" policies, fairly or not, population transfers would have made temporary separations at the border seem a minor issue. Is this supposedly enlightened notion of removing people a Never Trump tic, perhaps a punishment for not listening to their betters?

Schoenfeld also claims that I do not condemn (e.g., I practice ""sophistry in the service of a genuine evil"") Trump's alleged racist attack on Judge Curiel when Trump called him out as a ""Mexican"" judge. Again, he does not quote what I wrote. But here is the passage, and I will let the reader decide:

Trump, of course, himself had offended Mexican Americans with his rants from the first day of his campaign, and a later allegedly pejorative reference to US district judge Gonzalo Curiel (""of Mexican heritage"") who was assigned to a civil suit against ethically challenged Trump University. Outrage followed over Trump's correct but na√Øve identification of Curiel's heritage as ""Mexican"" (in the sense that there was no commensurate outcry about identifying Swedish Americans as ""Swedes"" or using ""the Irish"" for Irish Americans).

Worse followed from Trump's charge that ""he is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine."" As often was the case, Trump was certainly clumsy in his phraseology, likely wrong about the idea of innate racial or cultural bias on the part of Judge Curiel against Trump, and probably had the weaker case in the civil suit. But on the other hand, Curiel had indeed belonged to a ""club"" or ""society"": the California La Raza Lawyers Association. In the even-steven Trump world, an Anglo judge who had sought membership in a linguistically equivalent chapter of ""The Race Lawyers Association"" certainly would have faced charges of bias, especially in a case involving a highly controversial public figure.

So I made a number of points: Trump probably had the less persuasive legal case. In sloppy fashion, Trump did not grasp that in our politically correct culture, calling a Swedish-American a ""Swede"" or an Irish-American an ""Irishman"" is fine, but not so when describing a Mexican-American as ""Mexican."" (Yet if Schoenfeld traveled beyond Manhattan, he would discover that Mexican-Americans often casually refer to Mexican-American citizens as ""Mexican"" without the politically correct hyphenation.)

Schoenfeld omits my point: Trump's chief complaint was that Curiel himself was a member of a La Raza lawyers' organization, whose name, despite denials, quite literally translates as ""The Race."" The term found currency in the turmoil of 1960s, but we forget that the sloganeering was in popular usage before, in Francisco Franco's Fascist Spain. Using a pseudonym, the dictator himself wrote a novel called ""Raza,"" a racist and anti-Semitic tract claiming that the racial essence of Spain, not residence or language, defined an Iberian. The racialist messaging of ""The Race"" is why the National Council of La Raza recently bowed to popular pressure and changed its name to UnidosUS, apparently to convey an inclusive message exactly opposite from the inferences of its prior tribalist nomenclature.

But where Schoenfeld, the supposed scholar of intelligence operations, becomes incoherent is in his surprising ignorance about the overreach of the administrative state in general, and, in particular, the role of the Steele dossier in ginning up Russian-collusion hysteria:

Hanson has also drunk deeply from the gourd of conspiratorial thinking. He goes on for pages about the nefarious ""deep state,"" which he claims has ""the unlimited resources of government at its call,"" and whose ""operating premises have embraced multiculturalism, feminism, and identity politics."" It is this deep state, he argues, that has been engaged in an all-out effort to kneecap Trump and remove him from the White House, with the Mueller investigation at the center of the conspiracy.

Elaborating and amplifying a stock Trump talking point, Hanson maintains that it was not Trump's but Hillary Clinton's campaign that was tacitly colluding with Russia to manipulate the 2016 election. Trump, he insists, was actually ""a victim of Russian collusion at the very time he was being accused of it.""

This theory rests on the idea that the Steele dossier, the document compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele to explore Trump and the Trump campaign's various links to Russia, was actually Kremlin disinformation designed to help Clinton capture the White House. But this defies logic, not to mention common sense. As it happened, the sensational material in the dossier only came to public attention via Buzzfeed in January 2017, on the eve of Trump's swearing in. If Clinton and high officials in the FBI were in cahoots to sabotage Trump, why did they not leak the dossier, already in their possession, to the media before the election when it could have done the Trump campaign serious damage? Unsurprisingly, this is a question that Hanson opts not to entertain.

There is unfortunately a lot of ignorance in just those three silly paragraphs.

What exactly was the intent of the serial lawsuits challenging voting machines immediately following the election, the initial articles of impeachment, the efforts to subvert the Electoral College voting, the desperate efforts to invoke the emoluments clause, the 25th Amendment, and the ossified Logan Act, followed by the Mueller investigation, the tragicomic McCabe-Rosenstein palace coup, and the dozens of present House investigations -- if not to abort a presidency by means other than an election?

Rarely have such intentions been so shamelessly stated as in the September 5, 2018, New York Times op-ed by ""Anonymous"" -- timed to coincide with the release of Bob Woodward's latest insider account, this one of the supposedly imploding Trump White House. The unnamed Trump-administration official boasted that he and his patriotic #Resistance confederates were deep within the Trump administration and were stealthily using their bureaucratic powers to nullify any presidential efforts that they in their superior wisdom and morality found disagreeable. (""It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,"" Anonymous reassured readers.) According to the unelected and disgraced former FBI director Andrew McCabe's own admission, both he and DOJ deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein discussed -- to the point of Rosenstein contemplating wearing a wire -- the possible 25th Amendment mechanisms under which they might remove an elected president. The zealous careerist McCabe also tells us that he had to send his FBI minions after Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- again for the good of us all.

Why did DOJ and FBI officials seek surveillance on American citizens without fully apprising a FISA court that the basis for such requests was an unverified dossier, compiled by a retired foreign national, who purchased unverified Russian sources, who himself had been fired from the FBI as a consultant, who was paid by the Clinton campaign, albeit stealthily through two firewalls, and who was the circular source for news accounts used to substantiate the dossier?

What business does the FBI have communicating with an informant prying into an ongoing presidential campaign? Why exactly did U.N. ambassador Samantha Power, mostly in her last year in office, make more than 260 requests to unmask the names of American citizens surveilled by the U.S. government (some of them mysteriously leaked) and then claim, under oath, that she, in fact, did not herself make those requests but that someone (unidentified) made them ""in her name""? There is a reason, although ignored by Schoenfeld, that more than 20 FBI and DOJ officials have been fired, reassigned, demoted, retired, or resigned. And there is a reason that, on 245 occasions, the former director of the FBI claimed under oath to Congress that he either couldn't remember or did not know the answers to congressional questions. Try that tactic sometime with an IRS auditor.

Where Schoenfeld seems unfortunately delusional is in his weird claim that the dossier did not matter because there was no effort to spread its unverified smears before the election when it might have done damage:

Why did they not leak the dossier, already in their possession, to the media before the election when it could have done the Trump campaign serious damage? Unsurprisingly, this is a question that Hanson opts not to entertain.

Should we laugh or cry at that? I did not ""entertain"" that question because I did not think anyone could be so clueless as to ask it.

Does he not know that journalists such as David Corn of Mother Jones and Michael Isikoff of Yahoo News were running news stories before Election Day alleging Trump-Russian collusion, sensationalism largely derived from dossier smears leaked to them with the help of wink-and-nod government sources? Both unsubstantiated leaked stories were widely circulated and amplified. They did do damage to the Trump campaign, and they did reflect an effort on the part of Obama-administration officials to plant the dossier and see its unverified allegations spread -- consistent with an ongoing FBI bad habit of leaking narratives to advance personal and political agendas.

FISA court warrants -- at least one of which was issued before the election -- were in part based on news accounts of the Steele dossier, which in circular fashion had been leaked to those very news organizations. And so why and how was it that the media were reporting in September 2016 on Carter Page as a veritable Trump-Russian colluder -- at about the time that the U.S. government was using the Steele dossier to prepare an impending October FISA warrant request to surveille Page? Or as Politico's Julia Joffe put it, during the autumn 2016 pre-election frenzy to tie Trump to Russia on the basis of Carter Page:

Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page's trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign. . . . I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post.

British court filings reveal that FBI contact Steele himself was leaking the dossier to Yahoo News and would later claim he'd done so as an insurance policy to thwart an unlikely Trump presidency or to provide grounds to question ""the legal validity of the outcome"" in the unlikely event that he won. Even the New Yorker's Jane Mayer reported that Steele had seeded his allegation among a number of Obama officials before the election, before himself leaking it to the media in late October:

At Fusion's urging, Steele decided to speak, on background, to the press. Identified only as a ""former Western intelligence officer,"" he told David Corn, of Mother Jones, that he had provided information to the F.B.I. as part of a ""pretty substantial inquiry"" into Trump's ties to Russia. He noted, ""This is something of huge significance, way above party politics.""

Bruce Ohr, a high-ranking Justice Department attorney, who had not disclosed on federal forms that his wife was working with Steele on the dossier, had met with both Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele. He also held additional meetings with high-ranking FBI and Justice officials -- well before the election.

So there was also a reason for Glenn Simpson to lie to a congressional committee, claiming that he did not meet with Justice official Ohr until after the election.

Of course, government leaking surged to new heights after the election -- but only because prior to Nov. 8, 2016, the FBI top brass had seen the dossier only as an ""insurance policy"" that was not essential to the expected Clinton landslide. Immediately after Trump's victory, Steele's smears were planned not to stop candidate Trump but to derail his unexpected presidency.

Schoenfeld only fuels the popular perception of The Bulwark Never Trumpers as an angry, coastal elite who are anguished that their warnings about Trump were ignored by both hoi polloi and their conservative ""grifters and trolls."" In careerist fury, he now damns others for his own self-immolation -- as if the country must suffer for the sins of not listening to his own genius, which would probably have given the country a 16-year Obama-Clinton regnum.

That Never Trumpers at The Bulwark were wrong about the Trump nomination, the general election, and the first two years of the Trump administration seems only to have fueled their spitefulness. If Schoenfeld is representative of this rump movement, then they are engaging in projection.

How strange to suggest that writing a book about why Trump got elected and why he has done well is proof of one's careerist effort to gain favor with a politician or perhaps find employment in his administration. This is a charge against those who have never worked in a campaign or sought administration employment, leveled by those who most certainly have done one or both in the past and no doubt will in the future -- at least if they can pull off yet another careerist contortion in 2024.

The bitter hostility of Schoenfeld reflects the Trump-assassination theme pushed by celebrities. Just as Madonna, Kathy Griffin, and Johnny Depp vie to see who can most grotesquely envision Trump's death, so too Never Trumpers seek ever-more-creative ways to gnash their teeth at Trump and his supporters. Instead of trying to smear those with whom they disagree, they might have at least offered a coherent defense of their own creed, such as it is.

Instead of shrill charges and exclamations, Schoenfeld might have explained why Trump got elected, and why the preferred candidates of The Bulwark did not. And why have Republicans not won 51 percent of the presidential vote since 1988, in an era when they've done well at the state and local level? And, most important, why exactly do Schoenfeld and his associates oppose a president who has enacted a conservative menu that was once mostly their own? Why do they attack a president who is trying to stop a neosocialist agenda that was once likewise anathema to them?

Were some always closet progressives, and have they now found Trump hatred a convenient entr√©e into the progressive world? Or is it that Trump's agendas must be stopped because his handprints on them soil what they once favored? But for that paradox to be credible, the Never Trumpers would have to show us that past successful presidents have not engaged in behavior comparable to Trump's during his tenure and therefore did not earn commensurate outrage from them, or that the current hatred of Trump is not due in part to singular media bias and a new electronically wired age.

Would they argue that the mostly unreported details of the White House behavior of FDR, JFK, or Bill Clinton, or the past business and career practices of Harry Truman or LBJ, nullified their presidencies, or that the behavior of these presidents was more reprehensible than Trump's in the White House?

Or are they making an argument that Jimmy Carter and Jerry Ford were effective presidents because they were both men of exceptionally sterling character? Or do they assume that effective presidents of sterling character (such as Ronald Reagan) are commonplace candidates?

Like it or not, most Americans do not always have the choice to vote for presidents largely on the basis of their personal comportment rather than on the issues the candidates embrace and the likelihood that they will keep campaign promises and seek to carry them out -- and can win the election. Nor do non-elites see candidates in a vacuum, without regard to the alternative.

""Little rocket man"" may or may not be a puerile presidential outburst, but not achieving annualized 3 percent GDP growth for a decade, or leaving the border wide open, or writing off the industrial heartland, or doing little to address minority unemployment -- or for 20 years soberly and judiciously giving billions to the Kim dynasty as it sought its present arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles pointed at the West Coast -- may be a far greater moral sin.

If America had listened in 2016 to such Never Trump advocacy, we would now be in the eleventh year of a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton continuum, a tenure well on the way to completing the much-vaunted fundamental progressive transformation of the country -- to the detriment of millions of Americans. Donald Trump for the time being has interrupted that arc of history. In 2020, he will likely be the Republican nominee. The Manichaean choice will be between his policies of 2017-20 and what is shaping up as a radical neosocialist agenda not seen in 90 years that will include, but not be limited to, an anti-Israel and anti-Semitic venom, veritable legal infanticide, reparations, the Green New Deal, the abolition of ICE, virtual open borders, a wealth tax, a 70-90 percent top income-tax bracket, Medicare for all, and who knows what else in the next two years.

Most voters, admirably or not, do not always believe that their president must be morally perfect to do good, but only that, in practical terms, he must at least appear better than the alternative. A prior generation wanted the mercurial General George S. Patton leading the Third Army in France, and thereby saving American lives -- a rare military genius who made Trump's personal life, speech, and behavior appear quite tame in comparison.

The final irony? Schoenfeld claims that The Case for Trump indicts me as a treasonous sophist. But at least I can say that as a realist I seek to advance conservative causes that are transparent about their agendas and funding.

Schoenfeld was once a professed conservative who now conveniently adopts positions he once refuted, and he does so while in pay to a billionaire leftist who in large part underwrites The Bulwark's invective to damage conservatives.

Since the malleable Schoenfeld is fond of historical allusion, so be it. There was once a proper Cold War term for what he has sadly turned into -- a useful idiot, whose loud but transient and minimal utility to the Left will abruptly cease when Donald Trump leaves office.",393,nationalreview.com,"Case for Trump, Never Trump, Bulwark Never Trump"

Then you sit back, and brace for a wave of stories about your apology, all of which simply provide a pretext for attacking you again.

In the end, you get fired, you lose your job. Nobody defends you. Your neighbors avert their gaze as you pull into the driveway. You are ruined. And yet, no matter how bad it gets, no matter how despised and humiliated you may be, there is one thing you can never do -- one thing that is absolutely not allowed. You can never acknowledge the comic absurdity of the whole thing. You can never laugh in the face of the mob.

You must always pretend that the people yelling at you are somehow your moral superiors. You have to assume what they say they are mad about is what they are actually mad about. You have to take them at face value. You must pretend this is a debate about virtue and not about power. Your critics are arguing from principle, and not from partisanship.

No matter what they take from you in the end, you must continue to pretend that these things are true. You are bad, they are good. The system is on the level.

But what if we stopped pretending for a minute? What if we acknowledged what's actually going on?

One side is deadly serious. They believe that politics is war. They are not interested in abstractions or principles, rules or traditions. They seek power, and they intend to win it with whatever it takes. If that includes getting you fired or silencing you, or threatening your family at home, or throwing you in prison, okay. They know what their goal is. If you are in way, they will crush you.

What's interesting is how reliably the other side pretends that none of this is happening. Republicans in Washington do a fairly credible imitation of an opposition party. They still give speeches. They tweet quite a bit. They make certain noises about how liberals are bad.

But on the deepest level, it's all a pose. In their minds, where it matters, Republican leaders are controlled by the left. They know exactly what they are allowed to say and believe. They know what the rules are. They may understand that those rules are written by the very people who seek their destruction, but they ruthlessly enforce them anyway.

Republicans in Washington police their own with a never-ending enthusiasm. Like trustees at a prison, they dutifully report back to the ward, hoping for perks. Nobody wants to be called names. Nobody wants to be Trump.

How many times have you seen it happen? Some conservative figure will say something stupid, or incomplete, or too far outside the bounds of received wisdom for the moral guardians of cable news? Twitter goes bonkers. The mob demands a response. Very often, the first people calling for the destruction of that person are Republican leaders. You saw it with the Covington Catholic High School kids. You see it all the time.

Kevin McCarthy spends half his day telling Republican members not to criticize progressive orthodoxy. Paul Ryan did the same before him. A couple of years ago, the entire Democratic Party decided to deny the biological reality of sex differences, an idea that is insane as it is dangerous. Republican leaders decided to not criticize them for it. They might get upset.

This is a system built on deceit and enforced silence. Hypocrisy is its hallmark. Yet in Washington, it's considered rude to ask questions about how exactly it works. Why are the people who considered Bill Clinton a hero lecturing me about sexism? How can the party that demands racial quotas denounce other people as racist? After a while, you begin to think that may be their criticisms aren't sincere. Maybe their moral puffery is a costume. Maybe the whole conversation is an absurd joke. Maybe we are falling for it.

Since the day we went on the air, they [the left] have been working hard to kill this show. We haven't said much about it in public; it seemed too self- referential. The point of this show has never been us. But now, it's obvious to everybody. There is no pretending that it is not happening. It is happening, and so, going forward, we'll be covering their efforts to make us be quiet.

You sometimes hear modern progressives described as ""New Puritans."" That's a slur on colonial Americans. Whatever their flaws, the Puritans cared about the fate of the soul and the moral regeneration of their society. Those are not topics that interest progressives. They're too busy pushing late-term abortions and cross-dressing on fifth-graders.

These are the people who write our movies and our sitcoms. They are not shocked by naughty words. They just pretend to be when it's useful. It's been very useful lately.

The left's main goal, in case you haven't noticed, is controlling what you think. In order to do that, they have to control the information that you receive. Google and Facebook and Twitter are fully on board with that. They are happy to ban unapproved thoughts, and they don't apologize for it. Same with the other cable channels and virtually every major news outlet in this country.

One of the only places left in the United States where independent thoughts are allowed is right here at Fox News -- the opinion hours on this network. Just a few hours in a sea of television programming. It's not much, relatively speaking. For the left, it's unacceptable. It demands total conformity.

Toughness is a rare quality in a TV network, and we are grateful for that. Second, we've always apologized when we are wrong and we will continue to do that.

"The founder of 63red says he wants conservatives to feel safe while they are dining and shopping.

A new app is aiming to help conservatives find eateries and establishments where they would be ""safe"" from having their political opinions critiqued while dining.

""We feel like there's a general unease among conservatives out there, about whether they'll be protected and safe as they go out to restaurants and local businesses,"" the app's founder, Scott Wallace, said on Monday's edition of ""Fox and Friends.""

Sometimes referred to as a ""Yelp for conservatives,"" the new app - called ""63red Safe"" - asks users to rate restaurants based on four criteria.

RESTAURANT OWNER ISSUES APOLOGY AFTER BANNING BANNED DINERS WITH MAGA HATS

""It's just four quick questions, yes or no questions,"" said Wallace. ""Number one: Does this location serve all customers regardless of political beliefs? Will they protect their customers if they're under attack by others in the restaurant? There's a concealed carry question, and [if] the location [has] a political presence in their social media,"" he said.

It was not clear how customers would go about obtaining some of the information, or confirming they had obtained the necessary info from restaurant owners, before reporting the answers to the criteria to the app, which then deems the establishment ""safe"" or ""unsafe.""

MAYOR OF BOLOGNA SICK OF TOURISTS ASKING FOR DISH THAT 'DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST'

Wallace added that the app was not designed to ""find restaurants that are conservative, or pro-Trump,"" but rather to ""get politics out of local businesses, local restaurants, and make everyone feel comfortable when they go out.""

However, he also said he was ""deeply concerned"" about ""the rise of the socialist goon squad"" in the months leading up to the 2020 election, he told The Daily Beast.

""I think Antifa was nothing compared between now and what's coming in 2020.""

"The debate among Democrats as to whether they should impeach President Donald Trump took another turn after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, revealed during an interview that she opposed based on the known evidence.

Pelosi told the Washington Post that impeachment is ""so divisive to the country"" and insisted that there has to be ""something so compelling"" that would pave the way for a bipartisan vote. She said Trump is ""just not worth it.""

During the Special Report ""All-Star"" panel, NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt, and Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York weighed in on the fight within the Democratic Party and if impeachment is a viable option.

Liasson noted that Pelosi was ""inching up to this declaration for a while,"" and that she and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-NY, are on the same page regarding the necessity of waiting for evidence and for bipartisanship before proceeding.

""This is why they pay her the big bucks, this is why she's the leader and for people who want to impeach him, they can now blame it all on her,"" Liasson told the panel. ""She's gonna take the hits, but what she said was this could backfire on Democrats politically and it's not worth doing that.""

The NPR correspondent elaborated the political consequences Republicans faced after the House impeached President Bill Clinton in the 90s, which boosted his popularity in the final years of his presidency and warned that history can repeat itself with President Trump.

TLAIB SAYS SHE'LL INTRODUCE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMP THIS MONTH

""What people forget is impeachment is not removal. He is not going to be removed from office because Republicans in the Senate are not going to vote for that. The voters will have a chance in 2020 to render a verdict on Donald Trump,"" Liasson continued.

Stirewalt told the panel that Pelosi is ""setting the bar high"" and that she's ""of course right"" in the broad interest of the Democratic Party as opposed to freshman congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich, who keeps pushing for impeachment in what he insisted would be a ""unsuccessful effort.""

Meanwhile, York expressed that the ""impeachment machine was up and running"" on Capitol Hill, pointing to Nadler's declaration that Trump was ""guilty"" of obstruction of justice.

"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on how the new generation of Democrats in Congress are pushing the party further left, which gives ample ammunition to President Trump to attack them as socialists.

The Democrats are in a leftward lurch that could ruin their chances of retaking the White House.

Rahm Emanuel, now stepping down after two terms as mayor of Chicago, knows something about winning elections. He was a key White House operative for Bill Clinton and chief of staff for Barack Obama.

It was Rahm, as chairman of the Democratic campaign committee, who engineered the party's takeover of the House in 2006 -- and is known for his hardball brand of politics, with all the subtlety of his frequent F-bombs.

If Mayor Emanuel believes the Democrats are in danger of self-destructing, as he argues in a piece for the Atlantic, his party might want to pay attention.

I've been arguing that the Democrats, who regained control of the House in November mainly on the strength of more moderate candidates, are increasingly being defined by their most extreme members.

Just look at the last few weeks, and the stances embraced by some of its presidential contenders and younger members: Slavery reparations. Green New Deal. Medicare for All. Free college tuition. A 70 percent tax rate on income over $10 million. Break up Amazon, Facebook and Google.

2020 DEM CONTENDERS HARRIS, SANDERS, GILLIBRAND FACE #METOO BACKLASH

Is that how they win back Trump Democrats in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin?

Add to that various self-inflicted wounds, such as delaying and then watering down a resolution to denounce Rep. Ilhan Omar after her latest anti-Semitic comments, and you've got a party with a problem. (President Trump went way overboard in saying the Democrats have become ""an anti-Jewish party"" and telling donors that ""the Democrats hate Jewish people,"" given that perhaps three-quarters of Jews vote Democratic. But he was seizing on an opening.)

At the South by Southwest conference, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez offered the standard left-wing critique of capitalism by saying that ""we're reckoning with the consequences of putting profit above everything else in society."" But she added that ""to me capitalism is irredeemable,"" the kind of sound bite that goes viral, given the enormous media attention she attracts.

And on ""Morning Joe"" the other day, 2020 contender John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, repeatedly refused to call himself a capitalist. When did that become a dirty Democratic word?

In the Atlantic, Emanuel says Trump could win over swing voters by constantly branding the Democrats as socialists.

HILLARY CLINTON HUDDLES WITH 2020 DEMS, INCLUDING BIDEN, HARRIS AND BOOKER

""The last thing we should do is serve him slow pitches over the plate that allow him to define us on his terms. Unfortunately, that's exactly what Democrats have been doing since he went before Congress in early February. It's almost as if we've been duped into reading from his ready-made script.

""Earth to Democrats: Republicans are telling you something when they gleefully schedule votes on proposals like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, and a 70 percent marginal tax rate. When they're more eager to vote on the Democratic agenda than we are, we should take a step back and ask ourselves whether we're inadvertently letting the political battle play out on their turf rather than our own. If Trump's only hope for winning a second term turns on his ability to paint us as socialists, we shouldn't play to type.""

He's not pulling punches.

While saying the party shouldn't abandon its core priorities, Rahm says Democrats and independents are so desperate to win that they'll support a candidate who doesn't agree with them on everything, as long as that person is seen as able to win.

""So the ideological debates often shroud what voters really want -- a nominee capable of standing steady and strong as Trump tries to bully his way into an Election Night victory. The president's low approval ratings suggest that, if he wins a second term, Democrats will have no one to blame but ourselves.""

SANDERS CAMPAIGN HITS BACK AT CASTRO'S 'REPARATIONS' DIG, ACCUSES LONGSHOT 2020 DEM OF PLAYING POLITICS

What began as a broadside from the right has now gone decidedly mainstream as the stumbles continue. The argument even made the front page of Sunday's New York Times:

""The sharp left turn in the Democratic Party and the rise of progressive presidential candidates are unnerving moderate Democrats who increasingly fear that the party could fritter away its chances of beating President Trump in 2020 by careening over a liberal cliff.""

The challenge for Pelosi is to rein in her more lefty members who are sharply changing the public face of the party. But she can't control the Bernie-style presidential candidates who seem to believe that a hard left turn is the way to win the nomination.

Fox News Chastises Pirro

Jeanine Pirro, the Fox weekend host who is friendly with President Trump, has drawn a strong rebuke from the network.

She took on Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, in remarks that crossed a line.

Judge Jeanine said Saturday night that Omar is ""Sharia-compliant"" and engages in ""Sharia-adherence behavior."" Why? Because the freshman Democrat wears a hijab.

She asked: ""Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which is antithetical to the U.S. Constitution?""

In a statement, Fox News said: ""We strongly condemn Jeanine Pirro's comments about Rep. Ilhan Omar. They do not reflect those of the network and we have addressed the matter with her directly.""

I've been critical of Omar for making anti-Semitic comments about money, then apologizing, then making more remarks about pro-Israel advocates having ""dual loyalty"" -- an old anti-Semitic canard that is one of the worst things you can say about Americans.

CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

But the congresswoman should be able to wear whatever she wants in accordance with her religious beliefs. That shouldn't result in her loyalty to the Constitution being questioned. And the comments were in Pirro's scripted opening remarks, not something uttered off the cuff.

Omar thanked Fox for the statement, tweeting: ""No one's commitment to our constitution should be questioned because of their faith or country of birth.""

Pirro, a former prosecutor, is not backing off, however. In a statement Sunday, she said, ""I did not call Rep. Omar un-American. My intention was to ask a question and start a debate, but of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don't support the Constitution."" She invited Omar to appear on her show.

As the Hollywood Reporter noted, Pirro's slam drew criticism from a staffer for ""Special Report with Bret Baier."" Associate producer Hufsa Kamal tweeted: ""@JudgeJeanine can you stop spreading this false narrative that somehow Muslims hate America or women who wear a hijab aren't American enough? You have Muslims working at the same network you do, including myself. K thx.""

"""I feel that -- I feel it very strongly,"" Trump replied when asked by Breitbart News's Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle about his pledge in the State of the Union address that the United States would never become a socialist country.

Trump continued by explaining that many Democrats are campaigning on socialism, however, because it is ""easy"" to campaign on but difficult ""to govern on.""

""Now with that being said, you always have to be very careful, because socialism is easy to campaign on but tough to govern on, because the country goes down the tubes,"" Trump said. ""But when you tell people free medical, free education, no more student loans -- all of the different things that you say -- it's a great thing to campaign on, but then ten years later the country is down the tubes. It's gone. So, you always have to be careful with it, because you know you talk about single-payer, it sounds very seductive -- single-payer -- say what you want, but it's a very seductive thing. But it means you're not going to have good healthcare, it means the country is not going to be able to afford it. Not only is the country not going to be able to afford it, but it's more than the entire revenue stream taken in for the entire -- it's like not even close right? But nobody thinks about that. They think, free healthcare isn't that wonderful? But the truth is when you're up on the debate stage, and they say we're giving you free education, we're giving you free healthcare, we're giving you everything you want and a Rolls-Royce in everyone's pocket, it's not an easy situation. But what happens is ten years later the country is gone. Okay, whether it's this country or any other country.""

In response to a follow-up question from Breitbart News senior White House correspondent Charlie Spiering, Trump said that the pendulum swings in politics frequently. Trump said that if the left somehow took control down the road, the voters would eventually course correct and choose a Republican next.

""Then what happens is you take a violent turn to the other direction,"" Trump said.

When Spiering asked if Trump is worried about a ""violent turn"" toward socialism after two years of his administration's policies, Trump said he is not. He pointed to his rising approval rating poll numbers, which he pointed out he has achieved despite overwhelmingly negative media coverage.

""I don't think so,f because we've had our best poll numbers,"" Trump said. ""You saw them -- we've had our best poll numbers. We had nothing but fake news. Fox treats me well -- and when I say well, I define well as fairly. It's not -- some of it's not so good at all. But at least it's fair. I do really well with local -- you know, the local stuff is shockingly good. It's almost like not even to be believed. But CNN and MSNBC and NBC, ABC, and yeah CBS, they're all extraordinarily bad. I would say NBC is maybe the worst and very dishonest. It's not even like bad, like bad reporting. It's totally dishonest reporting. It's really pretty incredible what they can get away with.""

Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow noted that many on the left are now coming ""out"" as socialists, publicly revealing themselves as such for the first time. When asked by Marlow whether he thinks there is a rise in support for socialism in the country, Trump questioned whether there actually is one happening. In his response, he pointed to how different Democrat presidential candidates have handled the question of supporting capitalism or socialism. Trump said the next election may very well be a referendum on socialism versus capitalism.

Trump specifically cited one candidate whom he mockingly said he would not name (he later whispered ""Hickenlooper"") for dodging a question on capitalism. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat running for president in 2020, dodged when asked whether or not he is a capitalist on MSNBC.

""Well I don't know if there will be a rise, we have to see that -- and that we will only know in an election,"" Trump said. ""So far, if you add it all up, you know, I watched a certain gentleman -- I won't mention his name,f but he made a couple of bucks, he refuses to acknowledge capitalism. You saw that over the weekend -- Hickenlooper. He was ashamed of the word, and yet I've seen others maybe going in the other direction.""

Trump's comments came during a more-than-40-minute exclusive interview in the Oval Office in the White House on Monday afternoon.

"In all but one of the last seven presidential elections, Republicans lost the popular vote. George W. Bush and Donald Trump won only by capturing narrow majorities in the Electoral College.

Hence the grand strategy of the left: to enlarge and alter the U.S. electorate so as to put victory as far out of reach for national Republicans as it is today for California Republicans, and to convert the GOP into America's permanent minority party.

In the Golden State, Democrats control the governors' chair, every elective state office, both U.S. Senate seats, 46 of 53 U.S. House seats and three-fourths of each house of the state legislature in Sacramento.

How does the left expect to permanently dispossess Middle America?

Let us count the ways.

In 2018, over 60 percent of Floridians voted to expand the electorate by restoring voting rights to 1.5 million ex-cons, all of Florida's felons except those convicted of sex crimes and murder.

Florida gave Bush his razor-thin victory over Al Gore. Should Trump lose Florida in 2020, he is a one-term president. If the GOP loses Florida indefinitely, the presidency is probably out of reach indefinitely.

Florida's Amendment 4 is thus a great leap forward in the direction in which the republic is being taken. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of the swing state of Virginia restored voting rights to 156,000 felons by executive order in 2016, calling it his ""proudest achievement.""

In California and Oregon, moves are afoot to reduce the voting age to 17 or 16. Understandable, as high schoolers are more enthusiastic about socialism.

Last week, a bold attempt was made by House Democrats to lower the U.S. voting age to 16. It failed -- this time.

Some House Democrats apparently feel that with ""Medicare-for-all"" and the Green New Deal of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez on the table, they have enough progressive legislation to satisfy the socialist base.

Thanks to Gov. Jerry Brown, every adult citizen in California who gets or renews a driver's license, gets a state ID card, or fills out a change of address form with the Department of Motor Vehicles is automatically registered to vote. Purpose: expand voter rolls to include those who have shown no interest in politics, so they can be located on Election Day and bused to the polls.

Ari Berman of Mother Jones writes that Nancy Pelosi's 700-page For the People Act that did pass the House contains ""a slew of measures designed to expand voting rights, which ... include nationwide automatic voter registration, Election Day registration, two weeks of early voting in every state ... restoration of voting rights for ex-felons, and declaring Election Day a federal holiday.""

House Republicans offered an amendment to the bill with language that said, ""allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.""

All but six Democrats voted against the GOP proposal.

The Democratic Party does not want to close the door to voting on migrants who broke our laws to get here and do not belong here, as these illegals would likely vote for pro-amnesty Democrats.

If the new U.S. electorate of, say, 2024, includes tens of millions of new voters -- 16- and 17-year-olds; illegal migrants; ex-cons; new legal immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America who vote 70 to 90 percent Democratic, the political future of America has already been determined.

California, here we come.

As a Democratic insurance policy, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen has introduced a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College.

Some Republicans support statehood for Puerto Rico, which would add six electoral votes that would go Democratic in presidential elections about as often as Washington, D.C.'s three have, which is always.

Ben Franklin told the lady in Philadelphia, ""We have a republic, if you can keep it."" Our elites today, however, ceaselessly celebrate ""our democracy.""

Yet John Adams was not optimistic about such a political system: ""Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes exhausts and murders itself. There never was a Democracy yet, that did not commit suicide.""

Thomas Jefferson, a lifelong believer in a ""natural aristocracy"" among men, was contemptuous: ""A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where 51 percent of the people may take away the rights of the other 49.""

Madison wrote in Federalist 10, ""democracies ... have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.""

If one day not far off, as seems probable, tax consumers achieve a permanent hegemony over the nation's taxpayers, and begin to impose an equality of result that freedom rarely delivers, the question of who should choose the nation's rulers will be tabled anew.

"In the latest case of the left's misplaced priorities, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio kicked off the workweek touting ""meatless Mondays"" mandating vegetarian diets at public schools. Meanwhile, economists were sounding the alarm that the finances of the city de Blasio is supposed to be running were getting carved up.

De Blasio has no problem lecturing kids at New York's public schools about ""cutting back on meat"" to save the environment. But he's shown less interest giving up the fleet of SUVs that bring him to and from the gym. Or reducing the pork in his stewardship of the taxpayers' finances. According to the New York Post, city spending has increased 32 percent in the de Blasio years, with an estimated $3 billion more expected in Hizzoner's latest budget.

NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO ORDERED HIS POLICE DETAIL TO PULL OVER TEXTING DRIVER

The mayor has grown fond of saying, ""There is plenty of money in this world. It's just in the wrong hands"" as a means of justifying his expansion of government into every aspect of life. No word if he counts he and his wife in the ""wrong hands"" camp after a recent media report suggesting the duo has squandered more than a billion dollars of unaccounted-for taxpayer dollars.

What else could be driving de Blasio's war on meat? It's one way to try and reclaim the mantle of most progressive New York pol. De Blasio has been outwitted and outflanked by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The freshman phenom from Queens didn't let her status as a newcomer deter her from defeating the Amazon deal backed by de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who suffered a stinging political defeat.

De Blasio isn't taking the hint that voters just aren't that into him.

If neither his diminished fanfare nor his abysmal record is enough to convince de Blasio to abandon White House ambitions, the polls should. His early campaign visits to Iowa aren't moving the needle one iota, with a new poll from the vaunted Des Moines Register putting him at zero percent - tied for dead last. Nationally, the picture is even worse. A Monmouth University survey showed Hizzoner as the only Democrat in the packed field with a net negative rating - an impressive feat.

But de Blasio isn't taking the hint that voters just aren't that into him. He's on the campaign trail, taking shots at his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, who was eyeing a 2020 bid before (correctly) concluding there was no path for a centrist in today's hard left Democratic nominating process.

Never content to take the high road, de Blasio sniped at Bloomberg's progressive credentials, adding he had ""no chance"" to capture the nomination. Call it a case of envy because whether you agree with him or not, Bloomberg accomplished far more on issues near and dear to the left than de Blasio ever will, both in and out of politics. On guns, climate change, immigration, Bloomberg outpaced de Blasio at every turn. Ditto with his overall leadership of the city.

Even those who know him best think de Blasio's White House ambitions are nonsensical. Politico quoted a friend calling the idea ""idiotic"" in a brutal story with a headline not fit for a family publication.

Still, with his titanic ego and facing term limits as mayor, de Blasio may very well press forward. He long ago lost interest in his day job.

"MANCHESTER, N.H. - Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's headed next month to the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, increasing speculation that the GOP governor is seriously considering a 2020 primary challenge against President Trump.

Fox News on Monday confirmed that Hogan will be in New Hampshire on April 23 to headline ""Politics and Eggs."" The speaking series hosted by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics and the New England Council is a must-stop for White House hopefuls.

HOGAN STOKES TRUMP PRIMARY CHALLENGE SPECULATION

Hogan, who won re-election last November to a second four-year term steering the reliably blue state of Maryland, indirectly criticized the president during his January inauguration.

And, last month - in an interview with CBS News - he said that ""I'm being approached from a lot of different people"" about launching a primary challenge against the president. ""And I guess the best way to put it is I haven't thrown them out of my office.""

BIDEN, SANDERS, TOP LATEST 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY POLLS

He also took aim at Trump's chances in 2020, saying, ""I'm not saying he couldn't win, but he's pretty weak in the general election.""

Still, Hogan acknowledged the extremely long odds against an intra-party challenge to a sitting president, highlighting that ""nobody has successfully challenged a sitting president in the same party in the primary since 1884.""

The 62-year-old governor also told Politico last month that ""at this point in time, I don't see any path to winning a Republican primary against this president, or anybody doing it. But things have a way of changing ... I don't know what the lay of the land is going to look like this summer, or in the fall.""

It's unprecedented. And in my opinion it's not the way we should be going about our politics.""

It's a remarkable time for America.

If our economy keeps growing, we will break the record this summer for the longest period of growth in our history, 10 unbroken years of economic expansion.

We are at full employment, with essentially every American who wants a job able to find one. And workers are earning more. February saw the fastest wage growth in a decade, with private sector workers earning an average of $27.66 an hour. Poverty rates haven't been this low since the late 1990s.

We are safer in our homes and lives than we've been in ages. Crime rates have plummeted in the past 25 years. Violent crime is down by almost half since 1993. Property crime rates have fallen by even more.

We are safe as nation, too. There are certainly long-term and strategic threats to the Pax Americana, but this is a remarkably peaceful moment in our recent history by any measure. Combat deaths, overall deployments and terror attacks are all at post-9/11 lows.

So answer us this: If the federal government can't get its fiscal house in order under such sublime circumstances, when do you suppose that it ever would?

We've got peace and prosperity enough to be the envy not just the whole world but of our own ancestors, and yet somehow our government continues to live dramatically beyond its means, borrowing about a quarter of the money it spends.

The White House today released a spending plan for the next decade that calls for adding another $10.5 trillion to our $22 trillion federal debt. And the administration's debt forecast is wildly optimistic, assuming as it does not just another decade of uninterrupted growth but growth at booming levels.

It's quite a lot of chutzpah for this White House to even talk about balanced budgets, but it gets into out-and-out farce to have government economists talking about doing so in the year 2034.

We just need another 14 years of peace and a booming economy and then we'll quit spending more than we have. Oh yeah, and we'll totally find the political will to cut entitlements and domestic spending along the way. Just not now.

Cool, cool.

This administration should be credited at least for following the law that requires presidents to submit budgets, something the Obama administration abandoned rather than having to produce politically damaging laughers like this one.

Of course it's Congress that's actually tasked with minding the books and setting spending priorities, and there you'll find an equally unserious attitude about fiscal matters. As their party veers toward confiscatory tax policy to finance astonishingly large new spending programs, now is hardly the time that mainstream Democrats want to get caught talking about restraint.

House Democrats today denounced the Trump budget blueprint for being too miserly while Senate Republicans mostly just ignored the matter. They know, as we all do now, that there will be no serious effort to address sending.

Congress will just wait until the end of September when the current spending legislation and borrowing authority will expire. Another shutdown. Another bloated deficit. Another year of budgetary drift.

Every serious person in politics and government knows what the consequences will be and that there will be a moment when the interest payments on our swollen debt mean disaster, likely in the form of massive tax increases and, eventually, default. But they will mortgage the futures of the next three generations anyway because there's no political gain in being a good steward.

When we are judged for our failings in this era of political disruption and realignment, high on the list will be the fact that while we were obsessing over the manufactured outrages of the moment we wasted a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put our finances in order.

The next era of real crisis and recession - and it will surely come - will make for a hard lesson about the foolishness of our current political class.

Smithsonian: ""The spot where Julius Caesar was murdered by members of the Roman Senate is one of the most infamous sites in world history. As a tourist spot, however, it's infamous in a different way: The ruins in the Largo di Torre Argentina, where dozens of stray cats now call home, are currently crumbling and fenced off from the public. But that's set to change. Julia Buckley at Conde Nast Traveler reports the area will soon undergo renovations before opening to the public in 2021. Rome's mayor, Virginia Raggi, announced that the restoration is being funded by the fashion house Bulgari, which will drop about $1.1 million on the project, funding earmarked to go toward cleaning up and securing the ruins, building walkways through the site and installing public restrooms, TheLocal.it reports. Though the spot of Caesar's murder was immortalized by ancient historians and, later, William Shakespeare, it was actually covered over by the expanding city of Rome and lost to history until the 1920s.""

Bernie's inroads with folks who didn't support him in 2016, however, suggest that he has a genuine opportunity to broaden his appeal and credibly compete for the nomination despite persisting resistance from the party establishment. ...

After the interview, Abrams insisted in a tweet that the comment did not mean she has ruled out running for president next year. 'In #LeadFromTheOutside, I explore how to be intentional about plans, but flexible enough to adapt. 20 years ago, I never thought I'd be ready to run for POTUS before 2028.

'I trusted and leaned on this statement that you made: 'You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable.'

Trump's campaign aims to be a behemoth - WaPo: ""President Trump and his advisers are launching a behemoth 2020 campaign operation combining his raw populist message from 2016 with a massive data-gathering and get-out-the-vote push aimed at dwarfing any previous presidential reelection effort... The president's strategy, however, relies on a risky and relatively narrow path for victory, hinged on demonizing Trump's eventual opponent and juicing turnout among his most avid supporters in Florida, Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest -- the same areas that won him the White House but where his popularity has waned since he was elected. Some advisers are particularly concerned about the president's persistent unpopularity among female and suburban voters, and fear it will be difficult to replicate the outcome of 2016 without former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as a foil.""

'Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he's just not worth it.' The speaker's remarks ran counter to sentiments expressed by some freshman members of her caucus, most notably Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who vowed to Democratic activists that she would help 'impeach the motherf---er' hours after she was sworn in this past January.""

House Dems push for Mueller report - Roll Call: ""House Democrats intend to send a message this week that the full report of special counsel Robert S.

The Rules Committee is scheduled to meet Monday evening on the concurrent resolution introduced by House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, with the backing of other Democratic chairmen. The Nadler resolution 'calls for the public release of any report special counsel Mueller provides to the attorney general, except to the extent the public disclosure of any portion thereof is expressly prohibited by law.' Unlike former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, William P. Barr, his replacement, is not recused from the Mueller probe... The resolution would also express the sense of Congress that the entire report should be transmitted to members of Congress.""

Dem 2020 hopefuls sweat the Mueller moment - New York Magazine: ""By now you shouldn't be surprised to hear that Robert Mueller almost never comes up on the 2020 campaign trail. ... Many of the campaign teams have, at some point in recent months, sat down to discuss what exactly they should do or say when the report drops, but each has also run up against a seemingly insurmountable problem: There's very little telling what's in it, and no lean and overstretched campaign staff is realistically going to be able to draw up useful road maps for so many different scenarios. ... The result is a partial paralysis for some campaigns: More than one candidate's advisers said they're holding off on scheduling major speeches, newsmaking announcements, or TV town halls until after the initial Mueller dust has eventually settled, concerned that their news will be completely overwhelmed if they inadvertently schedule something for the day the report is eventually filed, or revealed.""

"Gillibrand defends office's handling of aide's sexual harassment complaint

Several Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls -- including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and now Kirsten Gillibrand -- are defending their self-professed commitment to the ideals of the #MeToo movement against a series of accusations they recently mismanaged sexual-misconduct claims against their subordinates.

As the three prominent senators each have sought to draw a sharp contrast with President Trump, who has faced his own misconduct allegations, the claims highlighted vulnerabilities that could become major liabilities not only in a heated Democrat Party primary, but also in the general election.

Back in 2017, Gillibrand and others ramped up the pressure for then-Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., to resign amid sexual misconduct allegations. He ultimately stepped down.

Gillibrand, who has been described by GQ Magazine as ""the face of the MeToo movement,"" said at the time that Franken's alleged conduct had ""shocked and disappointed her"" and that he should ""step aside"" because ""enough is enough."" But, it emerged on Monday that last summer, an aide in her mid-20's who was working in Gillibrand's Senate office also apparently decided that enough was enough, as she resigned in protest over the office's handling of her sexual-harassment complaint against a senior male adviser to Gillibrand.

""I have offered my resignation because of how poorly the investigation and post-investigation was handled,"" the woman, who resigned less than three weeks after reporting the purported harassment, wrote to Gillibrand in a letter obtained by Politico. Gillibrand, responding to the allegations on Monday, said an appropriate investigation was launched -- and her office later said the male staffer had been fired after other unreported, ""deeply disturbing"" comments surfaced.

The woman was granted anonymity because of fears of retaliation.

Gillibrand faced immediate friendly fire after calling for Franken's resignation -- in 2018, liberal billionaire megadonor George Soros argued that Gillibrand turned on Franken to ""improve her chances"" in the 2020 presidential race -- and some of those hard feelings among her fellow progressives have not subsided.

For Sanders, the Vermont Independent who caucuses with Democrats, looming resentment from establishment progressives also has posed a major challenge. A January report in The New York Times outlining what one former Sanders delegate called an ""entire wave of rotten sexual harassment that seemingly was never dealt with"" during his 2016 presidential run seemed only to bolster on-the-record claims from Democrats that Sanders was too impersonal and arrogant to lead the party.

Asked by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper earlier this year whether he was unaware of the sexual harassment allegations, Sanders replied: ""Uh, yes. I was a little bit busy running around the country, trying to make the case."" He then appeared to smile.

EX-SPOKESMAN FOR SANDERS CALLS CLINTON TEAM 'BIGGEST A--HOLES IN AMERICAN POLITICS,' SAYS NEITHER HILLARY NOR HER SUBORDINATES ARE 'NICE' PEOPLE

The next week, after reports surfaced that a top aide was accused of sexually assaulting a female subordinate during Sanders' campaign, he issued a strong apology and a vow to change.

""To the women in that campaign who were harassed or mistreated I apologize,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""Our standards and safeguards were inadequate.""

Allegations of sexism also briefly surfaced contemporaneously during Sanders' 2016 bid, as some of his young, white male supporters -- known as ""Bernie Bros"" -- attacked Hillary Clinton and her followers online, contributing to a hostile atmosphere between the campaigns. In her book, the election retrospective ""What Happened,"" Clinton slammed Sanders for using ""innuendo and impugning my character"" such that she suffered ""lasting damage"" into the general election, although Clinton did not accuse Sanders of orchestrating the gender-based attacks.

The back-and-forth has continued into 2019. Late last month, after former members of Clinton's team leaked details concerning Sanders' expensive travel on behalf of the Clinton campaign after she secured the Democratic nomination, Sanders 2016 campaign spokesman Michael Briggs returned fire. ""You can see why she's one of the most disliked politicians in America,"" Briggs said, referring to Clinton. ""She's not nice. Her people are not nice."" Briggs went on to call Clinton and her team among the ""biggest a--holes in American politics.""

ROSEANNE BARR CALLS #METOO FOUNDERS 'HOS,' SAYS 'HARRIS SLEPT HER WAY TO THE BOTTOM'

But, although Gillibrand and Sanders have made public overtures to the alleged victims who worked for them, California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris acknowledged earlier this month that she still had not spoken to a woman who sued her former top adviser for sexual harassment, leading to a $400,000 settlement.

A spokeswoman for Harris insisted last December the team was ""unaware"" of the harassment allegations while Harris was California's attorney general, but the agency that she oversaw, California's Department of Justice, reportedly was informed about the complaint three months before she exited in early 2017.

The lawsuit, filed by Danielle Hartley, accused Larry Wallace of demeaning her based on her gender while she worked for him as his assistant. Hartley said Wallace placed his computer printer under his desk and often asked her to crawl under and refill it with paper as he sat and watched, sometimes with other men in the room.

""In this specific case, I have not talked to the victim,"" Harris told Univision. ""That case is being handled by the Attorney General's Office and I've left it up to that office to handle the case as they've seen fit, which included a settlement.""

KLOBUCHAR, WHO REPORTEDLY ATE SALAD WITH COMB, DOESN'T DENY TOSSING BINDER IN ANGER AS HORRIFIED STAFF LOOKED ON

In an uncomfortable twist, Harris' autobiography, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,"" which was released in January, praised Wallace's ""leadership"" in orchestrating a bias training program. Wallace, the former director of the Division of Law Enforcement in California, resigned last December.

"The war of words between Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Julian Castro over their disagreement on proposed reparations for descendants of slaves isn't showing any signs of letting up.

The independent senator from Vermont's 2020 presidential campaign manager - in a conference call Monday with reporters - accused Castro of playing politics and doing ""a disservice"" to Sanders' lifelong advocacy ""for racial and economic justice.""

CASTRO SAYS HE SUPPORTS REPARATIONS FOR DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES

Castro, the former San Antonio mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama, supports the idea of reparations for the descendants of slaves -- which could come in the form of tax credits, subsidized education costs or other ideas. Two other Democratic presidential candidates - Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - also back reparations.

Sanders rejected the idea of reparations during his 2016 White House bid, and earlier this month once again pushed back against the proposal.

""I think that right now, our job is to address the crises facing the American people and our communities, and I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check,"" Sanders said during an appearance on ""The View.""

BIDEN, CASTRO, TOP LATEST 2020 DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION POLLS

Castro on Sunday took a jab at Sanders' comments that a check wasn't the best way to address the issue.

""To my mind, that may or may not be the best way to address it,"" he said in an interview on CNN.

Targeting two of Sanders' signature proposals, Castro argued that ""it's interesting to me that, when it comes to 'Medicare for All,' health care, the response there has been, 'We need to write a big check,'"" Castro said of Sanders. ""When it comes to tuition-free or debt-free college, the answer has been, 'We need to write a big check.'""

""And so, if the issue is compensating the descendants of slaves, I don't think the argument about writing a big check ought to be the argument that you make, if you're making an argument that a big check needs to be written for a whole bunch of other stuff,"" Castro added.

Asked about those comments, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir told reporters ""no one's got a magic solution. We've had an awful legacy of slavery, an awful legacy of racial disparities across so many different areas. Anyone who tells you they have a magic bullet here is lying to you.""

And apparently zeroing in on Castro, Shakir added ""I do think that this effort to play politics with it does a disservice to the fact that Sen. Sanders...has been a lifelong advocate for racial and economic justice.""

Castro, who's said he would create a commission or task force to look into all possible ways to provide reparations if elected, is a long-shot to win the Democratic presidential nomination. The latest polls suggest that Sanders - along with potential contender former Vice President Joe Biden - is one of the front runners in the race.",404,Fox News,"Sanders campaign hits back at Castro's 'reparations' dig, accuses longshot 2020 Dem of playing politics"
"Young Americans are more likely to embrace socialism than past generations, according to a poll published by Axios on Monday.

According to the poll, conducted by the Harris Poll, 61 percent of Generation Z -- Americans aged between 18 and 24 -- have a positive reaction to the word ""socialism.""

That is compared to 58 percent of Generation Z who have a positive reaction to the word ""capitalism."" And among all Americans, 39 percent are ""well-disposed toward socialism.""

Axios reported:

Why it matters: The word ""socialism"" does not carry the same stigma it did in the past, now that it has been resurrected by celebrity politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Young people's political views often change as they grow older, but their support for socialistic policies is a sign that the old rules of politics are changing fast.

Ocasio-Cortez, a former Sanders organizer, ran and won on a Democratic-Socialist platform in her district.

However, older generations had a less positive view of socialism. Millennials, defined as between age 25 to 34, viewed socialism positively at 51 percent.

Positive views dropped dramatically among those in Generation X, defined as between ages 35 to 44. Only 38 percent had a positive view of socialism.

Those ages 45 and up were even less positive about socialism with numbers going into the 20s.

According to Harris, Generation Z and millennials are projected to make up 37 percent of the electorate in 2020.

Harris also took a look at top voting issues for each generation.

The top three voting issues for Generation Z were mass shootings, racial equality, and immigration policy and treatment of immigrants.

For millennials, it was access to health care, global warning/climate change, and mass shootings.

For Generation X, the top issues were health care, terrorism/national security, and the national debt -- the same issues for baby boomers and older generations.

"Today in the New York Times, columnist Jamelle Bouie offers a blistering attack on the racial politics of . . . Joe Biden, arguing his election as president would continue ""Trumpism"" in some ways:

For decades Biden gave liberal cover to white backlash. He wasn't an incidental opponent of busing; he was a leader who helped derail integration. He didn't just vote for punitive legislation on crime and drugs; he wrote it. His political persona is still informed by that past, even if he were to repudiate those positions now. Biden could lead Democrats to victory over Trump, but his political style might affirm the assumptions behind Trumpism. The outward signs of our political dysfunction would be gone, but the disease would still remain.

Last week, the Washington Post ran an article with the headline, ""Biden's tough talk on 1970s school desegregation plan could get new scrutiny in today's Democratic Party."" Clearly, a lot of progressives who prefer other candidates see this as a potential vulnerability. Current Affairs declared Biden's ""record on racial integration is indefensible."" Paste calls it his ""pro-segregation past.""

(Biden's anti-busing stances were one of the 20 Things profile of Biden.)

While there was a little bit of discussion about these parts of Biden's record back in 2008, there was no significant outcry from African Americans then when Obama picked Biden to be his running mate. Biden's runaway mouth -- ""first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"" ""you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent"" -- was well-known back then, and the Obama campaign overcame that challenge twice. The overwhelming majority of Democrats voted to put him a heartbeat away from the presidency twice.

Biden didn't lose the love of most Democrats after ""gonna put ya'll back in chains,"" ""my state was a slave state"" or ""these Shylocks.""

Just how much will African Americans, the Democratic-primary electorate, and the voters as a whole buy into the idea in 2019 that Joe Biden was somehow racist or pandered to racists? As luck would have it, McClatchy has a new article today, reporting that ""African-American faith leaders, state legislators, voters and party operatives in South Carolina"" believe that Biden shouldn't be underestimated among that demographic in that early primary state.

There's a chance that at some point, either one of Biden's rivals or a surrogate tries to press the former vice president on this, and he responds with something like:",406,nationalreview.com,Who Wants to Play the Race Card Against Joe Biden? | National Review
"In principle, I strongly support President Trump's plan to issue an executive order to protect freedom of speech on campus. Yes, there are many potential problems with federal intervention, but there is really no good alternative.

I don't know what will become of our ever more bitterly divided nation, but I do know there'll be no peaceful coexistence for our warring camps without a cooling of the campus free-speech crisis. It's no use looking to universities for a resolution. They are caught in a quicksand of their own creation and are well past the point of self-extraction. This isn't just a university problem either. The extremism of our politics; its historical na√Øvet√©; the bitter mutual recriminations that dog our every debate; the country's rising divisions along lines of religion, ethnicity, sex, and race; and the endangered liberties even of Americans well past college age; are all outcomes of the noxious spirits the academy has been injecting into the body politic for nearly six decades.

There are certainly good reasons to be wary of federal intervention in matters of local concern. We would much prefer our campuses to heal themselves. Yet it is foolish and blinkered at this point to believe that they will. That does not remove the dangers of ham-handed, biased, or counter-productive federal action. Yet it is equally mistaken to treat campus free speech as just another case in which unfettered markets will flourish in the absence of outside interference. The campus is the opposite of a free market. It's protected from market forces by tenure, and further insulated from public dismay -- and bursting economic bubbles -- by hundreds of billions of dollars in annual government subsidies.

In effect, American society over the years has struck a kind of bargain with the academy. Colleges and universities get special treatment and privileges: loads of free money; the right to insulate faculty hiring and the content of courses from public pressure; and an informal but powerful cultural norm of public non-interference. In return, all the academy has to do is conduct itself according to the accepted norms of liberal education. It must choose its faculty based on intellectual merit rather than politics; strive to present students with the best thinking from a wide range of sometimes conflicting perspectives, while avoiding ideological pressure and indoctrination; and it must protect the liberties of students and faculty to think and speak as they see fit, while taking care to instruct students in the fundamental principles of free speech, including freedom's foundational relationship to liberal education itself.

The problem is that the implicit bargain undergirding liberal education in America has been consistently and egregiously violated for decades. In fact, the old liberal bargain has now largely ceased to inform the spirit of American higher education. In place of that liberal bargain there has grown a fundamentally illiberal perspective in which freedom of speech and the various liberties upon which our constitutional system rests are dismissed as smokescreens for ""oppressive power,"" ""white supremacy,"" ""heteronormativity,"" ""neo-colonialism,"" etc.

From this new perspective, the principles of classical liberalism -- free speech, disinterested study, the search for truth, universal standards of excellence, neutral interpretation of law and principle, due process rights, etc. -- do not form a legitimate framework within which political contestation or authentic education can take place. They are instead sham excuses by which the dominant powers gull the oppressed into accepting their subordination.

The new university takes its mission to be the stripping away of this liberal smokescreen, and the empowering of oppressed groups and their allies to resist the system that dupes and disadvantages them. This is the ideology of the students who shout down visiting speakers, pull down displays that they don't like, and in various ways ostracize and intimidate students who disagree with them. These supposedly oppressed students and their allies act without scruple, fully convinced that they are justified in suppressing the speech of others because they view the very ideas of ""individual rights"" or ""rule of law"" as flimsy cover-stories for ""white supremacy,"" and such.

Students absorb these ideas from their teachers, the most active and influential of which have largely abandoned classical liberalism in exchange for the blend of postmodernism and neo-Marxism described above. There are whole departments now -- various forms of racial, ethnic, and gender studies programs -- where this ideology permeates and predominates. And the ethos of the ""studies"" programs, once peripheral to the university, now dominates even mainstream humanities and social science disciplines. The faculty once stood as a check against administrators too weak to protect free speech. Now faculty in the ""studies"" programs purvey an ideology that actually inspires speech suppression.

Administrators either share this ideology or are too afraid to explain to bullying students convinced of their own righteousness that shout-downs violate the principles upon which liberal education rests. Standing up to the bullies would require a commitment to classical liberalism, and a willingness to discipline students who disregard it. In the short term, this would yield additional angry and perhaps violent protests, which would in turn require still more determination and backbone from administrators. Knowing they are possessed of neither the courage nor the conviction to rein the bullies in -- and afraid of being thrown onto the defensive by accusations of racism, sexism, or bigotry of one sort or another -- administrators preemptively capitulate.

In fact the administration itself has been vastly expanded -- often after building takeovers by demonstrators -- by ""diversity"" bureaucrats who stoke the grievances of the coalition of the ""oppressed,"" and act as a kind of internal check on the college president. Worse, the new diversity bureaucracy now supplements restrictive speech codes and tiny, Orwellian ""free-speech zones,"" with ""bias-reporting systems"" that encourage students to anonymously turn each other in. Reports can and do lead to terrifying investigations of perfectly permissible speech.

The outcome is an atmosphere of self-censorship and fear, not only on the part of conservative and moderate students but even many liberal professors. With leading administrators afraid to stand up to accusations of bigotry from the intersectional coalition, students subject not only to peer-pressure but to unconstitutional speech codes, zones, and bias-reporting systems have little recourse. Their calculation is to speak their mind and perhaps face bogus accusations of bigotry, formal investigation, and punishment, or just stay silent and safe. Most choose silence.

In this way, a coalition of activist student groups animated by an extremist ideology keeps the rest of the campus in check. Ultimately, the student bullies are creatures of the radical faculty and the vastly expanded diversity bureaucracy. A coalition of activist faculty, administrators, and students holds the whip hand on campus, keeping dissenters silent and afraid.

The shout-downs at the center of the campus free speech crisis are merely the cherry on top. The shout-downs say to students and faculty: ""Shut up or we'll do this to you."" Shout-downs are spectacular public police actions, but the day-to-day reality is self-censorship, silence, and fear for anyone on the wrong side of the intersectional elite.

This system won't change on its own. Every year it deepens its hold on our campuses. The ""studies"" programs were once side-shows. Now they run the show. Once there were only speech codes. There followed cramped free speech zones. Now there are bias reporting teams. Whenever one of these pernicious devices is ruled unconstitutional by a court, the college looks for ways to reinstitute them by another route. Trigger warnings and safe spaces didn't exist until a few years ago. Now they're expected and demanded. I can't think of a single case in which a shout-down has been punished in a manner likely to deter future occurrences. In the few instances where discipline has been handed down, it's either a wrist slap, or has been paired with an action likely to nullify its deterrent effect.

We've been nearly 60 years getting to this point. Alabama governor George C. Wallace was disinvited from a talk by the president of Yale in 1963. That began a decade-long string of shout-downs and disinvitations, finally addressed, condemned, and rectified by Yale's famous Woodward Report of 1974. The Chairman of the commission that issued that report was historian C. Vann Woodward, perhaps the most respected faculty member at Yale in that era. Woodward's book, The Strange Career of Jim Crow, had been dubbed the ""historical bible of the civil rights movement"" by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And Woodward had advised Thurgood Marshall's legal team on the Brown vs. Board of Education case. Woodward was a legitimate civil rights hero. Yet just because of that, he saw that everyone's freedom depended upon the universality of basic rights. Undoubtedly, Woodward recalled that minority demonstrators during the civil rights era had often been protected when courts upheld their rights to free speech and free assembly. Woodward recognized that if Wallace could be stifled, support for everyone's rights -- minorities most of all, would be endangered. Today's shout-downs, where demonstrators chant ""liberalism is white supremacy"" or ""rule of law equals white supremacy,"" show the collapse of this understanding on campus.

When the Woodward Report came out in 1974, classical liberalism clawed its way back to the university's commanding heights and the excesses of the sixties were temporarily held at bay. Yet as the sixties radicals worked their way through graduate school and the junior faculty, eventually securing tenure, speech codes emerged, shout-downs went unpunished, the terms ""political correctness"" and ""multiculturalism"" came into wide use, and classic liberal education fell into decline.

By 1990s, two decades after his famous report, Woodward had come to believe that the fundamental pillars of liberal education in America were under threat. He joined the National Association of Scholars (NAS), alarmed that an organization dedicated to upholding the classical liberal values of free speech, free expression, and academic freedom was being stigmatized as reactionary by the campus left. In a brief but revealing 1993 address in which he accepted an award from the NAS, Woodward criticized extremist liberals whom he said were ""denying academic freedom by acting to control and police academic appointments, admissions, curriculum, teaching, and thought in order to promote their political programs.""

Woodward was witnessing the beginning of the end of the liberal bargain upon which the university had long rested. By ""political policing of academic appointments"" Woodward meant the abuse of the tenure system to secure a controlling majority on the faculty for the hard-left. He called these leftists ""extremists"" who dismissed as mere propaganda the central tenets of liberal education -- pursuit of truth and academic excellence, study of the great books, and the refusal to indoctrinate. In 1993, Woodward was convinced that majorities among both liberal and conservative academics opposed extremist ""intruders and their converts"" within the walls of the academy. He called for liberal and conservative believers in classic liberal education to get off the defensive and assert themselves.

Two years prior, in 1991, Woodward's close friend and fellow liberal, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., had published The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society. Schlesinger's prophetic and best-selling warning against the fragmenting of the American national community into a ""quarrelsome spatter of enclaves"" was hailed by liberals and conservatives alike at the time. Curiously, however, Schlesinger focused almost exclusively on K-12, ignoring higher education. He explained: ""The situation in our universities, I am confident, will soon right itself once the great silent majority of professors cry 'enough' and challenge what they know to be voguish nonsense.""

The confidence of Woodward and Schlesinger that the traditionally liberal majority on campus would follow their lead proved ill-founded. The 'great silent majority' of liberal professors stayed cowed. More than a quarter-century later, their replacements have been chosen by the very ideologues Woodward and Schlesinger feared.

So it's too late for change from within. The obstacles are vastly greater than when the alarm was first sounded and the hoped-for reform failed, nearly three decades ago. A critical-mass of tenured radicals now controls appointments; the dominant ""studies"" programs provide an institutional base for the new regime; and administrations are swollen with diversity bureaucrats who police the system. A 2018 Gallup survey showed that 37 percent of students see shout-downs as sometimes acceptable, while 10 percent approve the use of violence against speakers in some cases. That's enough to keep the campus crisis cooking for a very long time -- and enough to tear the country apart once they graduate.

The University of Chicago's President Robert Zimmer warns that Trump's executive order will lead to bureaucrats in Washington sitting in judgement of universities. That's rich, since those same universities have hired huge bureaucracies dedicated to policing speech. But shouldn't private universities have that right? Not when they depend on multi-millions in taxpayer dollars to subsidize their regime of silencing and suppression. Second only to life itself, freedom of expression is our most fundamental individual right. Zimmer speaks with authority, but only because the University of Chicago is the great exception to the rule. Zimmer's famous because he's not like the others.

The real conservative position would be to cut the government subsidies altogether, but there is no chance whatever of that happening. Few conservatives even bother to press for it. Why should the public subsidize an ideological training camp dedicated to turning half the children in America against their parents' values? Free speech advocates have warned for decades that discarding the liberal bargain on which the university has long rested would invite public intervention. That day has finally come, and the attendant dangers notwithstanding, it is long overdue.

Meanwhile, America's warring camps are at each other's throats. Politicians are hounded from restaurants like speakers on campus, and distinguished judges are denied due process in the face of questionable accusations, like something out of a campus kangaroo court. The left half of the country sees bigotry in every policy position on the right, even or especially when it's a matter of upholding classic liberal neutrality -- such as opposition to preferences or disparate impact rules. Even Democrats are now split between old-style liberals and a left that coddles bigotry from those at the top of the intersectional pecking order. The marginalization of old-time liberals within the academy is now replaying itself within the Democratic party as a whole.

Classical liberalism grants the right to study radical leftist ideas that if fully embraced would put an end to liberalism itself. It does not, however, grant the right to suppress the teaching and expression of alternatives, above all the principles of classical liberalism itself. Having proven for decades that it will not -- and cannot -- protect our fundamental freedoms, the academy has left us no choice but to set things right with the blunt instrument of federal intervention. Success is far from guaranteed and the dangers are many. Yet failure to act guarantees that the academy's descent into illiberalism will endure, poisoning our discourse and imperiling our freedoms till we are past the point of no return.",407,nationalreview.com,Trump's Campus Free-Speech Order and Our Cold Civil War | National Review
"AUSTIN, Texas -- South by Southwest (SXSW) may be one of the largest music and tech conferences in the country, but this past weekend it became a major political hotspot.

At least six Democratic 2020 presidential candidates visited the conference this past weekend to appeal to millennials -- and take aim at major tech companies like Google and Amazon.

The 2020 hopefuls tackled issues like climate change, socialism, and the Green New Deal at the conference, but the future of technology emerged as a key part of the conversation.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) addressed numerous instances of privacy breaches and even suggested possibly taxing companies for sharing data without users' permission.

Facebook is currently under fire for several scandals involving data and privacy breaches, potentially compromising millions of user accounts.

FACEBOOK SAYS 50 MILLION USER ACCOUNTS AFFECTED BY SECURITY BREACH

""For so long, these companies have said we've got your back, and that's just not true. The first thing we do is privacy legislation. I have a bipartisan bill to do that with notice of breach,"" said Klobuchar.

Klobuchar emphasized cracking down on monopolies, too, but shied away from giving a definitive answer when asked by Recode's Kara Swisher on whether companies like Facebook or Google should be broken up.

""I would want to have it investigated. That is how I do things. I don't just come in, break this up, break that up. We just have not had adequate investigation,"" said Klobuchar.

Neither Amazon or Google have responded to phone calls from Fox News seeking comment.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, has recently proposed breaking up big tech companies like Google and Amazon.

ELIZABETH WARREN PROPOSES BREAKING UP APPLE, IN ADDITION TO GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AND AMAZON

""It's a little like baseball. You can be an umpire or you can own teams. But, you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game. I'm deeply concerned that the space around companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google is now referred to by venture capitalists as the 'kill zone',"" said Warren.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro acknowledged Warren's proposal saying ""Is it worth considering that kind of proposal? Sure. I agree we have to be much stronger in terms of our antitrust examination and enforcement.""

Castro added that more should be asked of ""people at the top and wealthy corporations.""

""I don't understand how Amazon made over $11 billion in profit last year, and they paid $0 in federal taxes. At the same time, New York was about to offer them a $3 billion package, including half a billion dollars in direct incentives to locate their second headquarters in New York,"" said Castro.

But, Tim O'Reilly, a tech expert and founder of O'Reilly Media, is wary of Congress rolling out new regulation laws without them first learning about the way these companies work. He said lawmakers must be informed before implementing new legislation.

""Before we even start talking about solutions, like break up or any particular regulation, do we understand? I think in many cases, they are going to get regulated. And their goal should be to regulate the right way by bringing expertise to the table,"" said O'Reilly.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) revealed a fascist vision for America at this weekend's South by Southwest film festival.

We should not be haunted by the specter of being automated out of work. We should be nervous about the toll booth collector not having to collect tolls anymore. We should be excited by that. But the reason we're not excited is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job you are left to die, and that is at its core, our problem. And there are a lot of different solutions, a lot of different proposed ideas about how we go about that.

Bill Gates has talked about taxing robots at 90 percent. What he's really talking about is taxing corporations at 90 percent, but it's easier to say ""tax a robot.""

...

Whether you want to call it ""Democratic Socialism"" or ""Techno Futurism,"" or like whatever it is, it is because our technological advancement as a society has outpaced our system for handling finite resources. Because now we are approaching infinite resources.

Much to unpack here, so let's start with the overall aspect of this.

Basically, Ocasio-Crazy envisions a world where the government takes 90 percent from the rich and distributes it to hundreds of millions of American who no longer need to work due to automation.

Her ignorance, at least on this specific point, comes from two places: 1) Ocasio-Crazy believes people fear automation because they fear starving to death, and 2) she believes the unemployed are left to die in America.

Sure, there are people out there who would love to have a robot take over their jobs, become wards of the State, and live happily ever after high on medical marijuana and cable TV -- but those people are in the minority.

Most people fear automation because their work, even if it is in a tollbooth, offers a sense of purpose and pride. For most people, work is more than just the means to survive, it enriches the human spirit and fulfills those of us who provide for ourselves and our families.

Now, my point is not that we should oppose the progress of automation; my point is that Ocasio-Crazy, like most on the extreme left, has no basic understanding of human nature, or at least no respect for it.

In her second point, the ludicrous notion people are left to die in America... What nonsense. Unless you are mentally ill or dealing with an addiction -- in other words, beyond help -- American capitalism has eliminated poverty.

Oh, sure, we can create an arbitrary number, an arbitrary poverty line, but here in America there is no actual poverty. Everyone has access to K-12 education, everyone has access to health care (yes, even if you cannot pay); there is so much food obesity is what plagues the so-called poor, and the poor not only have a comfortable place to live, they have microwave ovens, TVs, video games, air conditioning, and a number of other luxuries only the wealthy could afford 75 years ago.

Later in her talk, Ocasio-Crazy reveals what she means by this buzz-phrase ""infinite resources:""

Capitalism is based on scarcity and what happens when there is enough for everyone to eat, what happens when there is enough for everyone to be clothed, then you have to make scarcity artificial. And that is what has happened. We have created artificial scarcity and that is why we are being driven to work 80 hours a week when we are being our most productive at any point in American history. We should be working the least amount we've ever worked if we were actually paid based on how much wealth we were producing. But we're not. We're paid on how little we're desperate enough to accept, and then the rest is skimmed off and given to a billionaire.

This is even beyond socialism and capitalism, which are based on the idea the ""workers"" are in charge.

Ocasio-Crazy wants to sell us the snake oil of a world where workers are no longer necessary, where if we surrender to automation, we won't have to work. You see, the robots will produce the goods we need, complete the services we need, and the government will support us by taxing the robot-staffed companies producing those goods.

Obviously, we will still need people to maintain and produce the machines, but that is what illegal aliens are for. As far as the factories that manufacture the machines, that's what the Chinese are for -- at least until the factories that make the machines are automated Terminator-style.

Ocasio-Crazy's America is one where no one has to do anything; the machines and the government do it all.

Let's pretend, for just a moment, that this economic system is feasible. It's not. For a million big and little reasons, it's bonkers, but let's pretend otherwise... That does not change the fact that what Ocasio-Crazy is really selling has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics. Hers is a political philosophy, not an economic one.

What happens to us if no one works and the government supports us? Where does that leave us as a society? Well, obviously it leaves us totally reliant on centralized government for everything, which means the government (and those in it) have complete control over us.

That's Ocasio-Crazy's goal here, that's the true agenda -- CONTROL, and in order to achieve that monstrous end, she's spewing Brave New World gibberish about ""Techno Futurism,"" which reminds me of the Brave New World gibberish about Obamacare.

If you recall, Obamacare was supposed to make everything easier, more centralized, and less expensive. But look at what happened with Obamacare -- the reality of it: it's a disaster, a bloated, choice-killing, wildly expensive disaster, but -- and this is by design -- it is a disaster that gives centralized government more control over our lives through our health care.

It's the same thing with Ocasio-Crazy's ""Techno Futurism."" In order to grab more and more control over our lives, she's selling a lie about being able to organize and control human nature through altruistic automation and altruistic taxes and an altruistic government that knows what's best for you. There is another name for this...",410,Breitbart,"Nolte: The Dark, Fascist Vision of Ocasio-Cortez's 'Techno Futurism'"
"A manager for Dolly Parton called out Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saying she did not get approval to use Parton's song ""9 to 5"" at her campaign events.

At a recent campaign launch event Warren played the Dolly Parton song ""9 to 5,"" which features lyrics that describe working class concerns.

Parton sings in part:

Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'

Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind and they never give you credit

It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion

You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion

Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me

I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!

However, Parton's manager, Danny Nozell, told the Associated Press, ""We did not approve the request, and we do not approve requests like this of (a) political nature""

Nozell, CEO of CTK Management, did not respond to a question about whether Parton's team might register any formal complaint about Warren's use of the song, which she played during a Friday town hall meeting in New York City.

If Parton escalates the matter, there's no shortage of precedent: The late Tom Petty reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., over the use of his song ""American Girl"" in her 2011 campaign, and former President George W. Bush got a similar letter from Petty over his choice of the singer's ""I Won't Back Down"" during the 2000 campaign.

"President Donald Trump's $8.6 billion request for border-wall construction in 2020 should be denied, and the funds should be redirected to schools and ""rebuilding America,"" say top Democratic leaders.

The Democrats' statement comes one week after a top security official said the cross-border flow of job-seeking migrants threatens to reach 900,000 in 2019.

""Our country faces challenges about jobs for the future, this money would be better spent on rebuilding America, and on education and workforce development for jobs for the 21st Century,"" said a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Chuck Schumer. The statement also stated that Democrats will block funding even if Trump refuses to sign Congress' budget:

President Trump hurt millions of Americans when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall. Congress refused to fund it and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will happen if he tries this again.

The Wall Street Journal reported March 10:

The $8.6 billion request for barrier funding -- $5 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and $3.6 billion for Defense Department military construction -- would enable the Trump administration to complete its plans for new or replacement barriers for 722 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, an administration official said. Of that, 122 miles of barriers are complete or under construction, the official said. The southern border is about 1,991 miles in length overall.

Separately, the proposal would also restore $3.6 billion in funding for military construction that the president tapped as part of his emergency declaration, the administration official said.

But the Democrats' call for more education spending is contradicted by their determination to preserve the inflow of uneducated migrants from Central Amerca. The migrants force down wages for many Democratic and Republican voters, drive up welfare spending and also reduce investors' incentives to invest in American-made labor-saving technology.

But the cheap labor also spikes profits and stock-market gains by the Democratic Party's donors.

On March 6, Homeland security chief Kirstjen Nielsen suggested Congress has imposed a policy of open borders on the United States. ""The truth is that the politics and policies of open borders have failed the American people,"" she tweeted.

Nielsen tweeted her message after enduring a hearing in which Democrats lashed at her for recording the catch and release of economic migrants.

"MANAGUA, Nicaragua - Grasping the iron bars at his home, Alex Vanegas is taken back to the dark prison cells where he spent the previous four months talking to fellow inmates through holes in the walls that also let in rats, scorpions and cockroaches.

During the unrest that rocked Nicaragua last year, Vanegas became a prominent symbol of opposition to President Daniel Ortega, instantly recognizable for his salt-and-pepper beard and shirts emblazoned with anti-government slogans as he jogged through the streets of Managua in the blue and white of his country's flag.

Arrested again and again, he was conditionally released in late February after four months in jail but is now barred from leaving his house.

Being cooped up hasn't cooled Vanegas' defiant belief that Ortega must leave office, even if for now he has to eschew public protest.

""All Nicaragua is a prison,"" the diminutive 62-year-old told The Associated Press in an interview.

A longtime athlete, Vanegas competed in track tournaments until he was 46, when he retired due to various maladies. He worked as a business administrator and in sales, and he also managed a roving DJ business.

Vanegas was moved to run again when student-led demonstrators took to the streets nearly a year ago to demand that Ortega leave office and allow early elections -- only for hundreds to die in a crackdown by security forces and armed civilian militias backing the president.

""On April 20 I was watching television and I saw Alvarito Conrado die,"" Vanegas said, referring to a 15-year-old shot in the neck as he carried water to university students hunkered down at a barricade. ""I was filled with anger, and I decided to run as a way of releasing that rage and that sorrow.""

He began by running around traffic circles in the capital, many of which are adorned by huge, colorful ""trees of life"" metal sculptures that were sponsored by and have become synonymous with Ortega's powerful first lady and vice president, Rosario Murillo.

""At first I would do a lap for every young person killed. ... Then it was 10, 20, 30,"" Vanegas said. ""And as every day there were more and more dead, I ran more and more laps.""

Nicaraguans took notice. Many took to calling Vanegas ""el maratonista"" -- roughly ""marathon man."" Others mused he was Nicaragua's version of Forrest Gump, the title character in the 1994 Oscar-winning film starring Tom Hanks.

He started receiving unsolicited gifts: hats, flags, bottles of water, a pair of shoes. Independent media outlets portrayed him as a symbol of a spreading rebellion.

""I run to force Ortega out,"" read the message on one of his T-shirts that, along with his cellphones, were confiscated by police each time he was arrested. They also took from him dozens of Nicaraguan flags, a symbol favored by the opposition against the red-and-black flags of Ortega's Sandinista movement.

Vanegas didn't always feel that way. As a young man, he said, he supported Ortega's struggle that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza and was jailed for four months as an urban guerrilla fighting for the Sandinista National Liberation Front.

He celebrated the triumph of the Sandinista revolution in 1979, but soon soured on what he saw as its authoritarian politics.

""Alex has become a symbol due to his bravery and his rebellion. Thousands of people love him because he represents everything that the people would like to do but can't,"" said activist Carla Sequeira of the non-governmental group Permanent Commission on Human Rights.

The government, not surprisingly, takes a different view.

Ortega and his allies have characterized protesters as ""coup plotters"" and ""terrorists,"" and that has included Vanegas.

On Aug. 13, when Vanegas promoted a run under the slogan ""Nicaragua wants justice,"" Murillo alluded to him by saying he was ""making a fool of himself"" running around in shorts. ""The same ones as always -- those who sell out their nation, the traitors,"" she added.

""I think he felt motivated by those (opposition) mobilizations and discovered that the way to show his political feeling and his solidarity was to have that permanent marathon,"" said Cairo Amador, a member of a truth commission created by Nicaragua's Sandinista-controlled legislature at the direction of Ortega.

Asked about Vanegas' popularity, Amador said, ironically, ""It's because we don't have any other marathon runner in Nicaragua, at least not one with his constancy and perseverance.""

Vanegas was arrested five times and released. Then, on Nov. 2, he was taken into custody at a Managua cemetery while accompanying victims' relatives on Day of the Dead. He spent four months behind bars.

The first 60 days were at El Chipote prison. Vanegas said he was poorly fed and had no access to sunlight, and it partially harmed his vision. The next two months were at Modelo prison, where Vanegas said he was not tortured but lived with vermin as cellmates.

The ""marathon man"" was one of about 100 people deemed political prisoners by rights groups who were granted conditional release Feb. 27, the same day Ortega's government resumed long-stalled talks with the Civic Alliance opposition group.

While negotiators have agreed on a roadmap for the talks, Vanegas sees the process as fraught with pitfalls ""because reconciliation cannot be imposed by decree, and this government has committed crimes against humanity.""

According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, at least 325 people were killed in the unrest and more than 2,000 wounded, while more than 50,000 fled Nicaragua. The government puts the death toll at 198.

The day after he was released, Vanegas laced up his shoes and began running through his neighborhood, surrounded a pack of journalists. Twice police detained him and warned him not to leave home.

So he stopped. The tiny, dark and cluttered house in the working-class neighborhood of La Luz is being watched day and night, he said, with police patrols passing every half hour.

Vanegas lives alone because his partner was allegedly warned she should stay away from him. His four children visit and bring food, ""but they are also afraid,"" he said.

""I risked my life to put Daniel Ortega in power,"" Vanegas said, ""and now he has me locked up in my own home.""",414,Fox News,Nicaragua 'marathon man' protester defiant from house arrest

"Country legend Dolly Parton is clearing the air, making known her views on the #MeToo movement and feminism in general. Parton said she has experienced sexual harassment but most likely not to the extent as other women who have spoken up had. The country singer also says that she relates to feminists but is hesitant to label herself as one because she never saw herself in that way.

When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced her presidential run, she did so underscored by Dolly Parton's working-class anthem ""9 to 5."" The song seemed to sum up the spirit of a candidacy built on giving workers a fairer shake.

The only problem is that the artist didn't give her permission to use the hit.

Parton's manager, Danny Nozell, revealed that not only did Warren use the song without permission, but that the singer doesn't ever allow her songs to be involved with any political campaigns.

DOLLY PARTON OPENS UP ABOUT THE #METOO ERA: 'I NEVER SLEPT WITH ANYBODY UNLESS I WANTED TO'

""We did not approve the request, and we do not approve requests like this of (a) political nature,"" Nozell told The Associated Press.

Nozell, CEO of CTK Management, did not respond to a question about whether Parton's team might register any formal complaint about Warren's use of the song, which she played during a Friday town hall meeting in New York City.

Parton is notorious for keeping both her music and herself out of politics. Following an appearance at the 2017 Emmys alongside ""9 to 5"" co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, the two bashed President Trump live on stage. Parton lightened the mood, saying: ""Well, I know about support,"" the country legend said pointing at her chest.

""I don't voice my political opinions,"" she told Fox News at the time. ""I just get out there and entertain. To me, that's what I do. I don't condemn them.""

She elaborated in a recent interview with The Guardian saying:

""I've got as many Republican friends as I've got Democrat friends and I just don't like voicing my opinion on things. I've seen things before, like the Dixie Chicks. You can ruin a career for speaking out,"" she said. ""I respect my audience too much for that, I respect myself too much for that. Of course I have my own opinions, but that don't mean I got to throw them out there because you're going to piss off half the people.""

DOLLY PARTON'S SISTER SLAMS SINGER FOR NOT SPEAKING OUT ON #METOO MOVEMENT IN COUNTRY MUSIC INDUSTRY

If Parton escalates the matter, there's no shortage of precedent: The late Tom Petty reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., over the use of his song ""American Girl"" in her 2011 campaign, and former President George W. Bush got a similar letter from Petty over his choice of the singer's ""I Won't Back Down"" during the 2000 campaign.

President Trump has faced his own rejection from popular artists after taking office, most recently from Rihanna. She tweeted in November that ""not for much longer"" would her music be permitted to play at Trump rallies, and soon after her representatives reportedly sent their own cease-and-desist request.

"Michael Wear learned of his birth mother's love for him and her faith. It's a love story that continues.

""Michael was born after an eleven-hour labor . . .""

""The foster mother described Michael as a good baby who enjoyed being talked to and who smiled and cooed . . .""

Michael Wear read this clinical report about himself when as a teenager he stumbled on a folder in his parents' basement. A folder from Catholic Charities was a discovery of some of the answers, from the witnesses to his birth, to questions about where he came from, questions that other children naturally learn along the way, piecemeal. It was different for Wear, as it is for most children who are not raised by their birth parents.

Also in that folder was a loving letter to the parents who would adopt him: ""Never be threatened by my being his birth mother. The longing I feel for him is so intense that I could never explain it to you, but I cannot go back on my decision. I know I have made the right choice.""

His birth mother continued:

The reason I am going into all of this is because I want you to try to love him without any reservation. You see, he has my love, but he won't know that 1st hand. I have had to trust many people in this past year that I never would have met if not for my pregnancy and though I am a trusting person, this is different. This tiny life was in my care until just over 2 months ago. Now he is with people I don't even know. The separation is difficult but the worry is worse. I am trusting him to you and I am sure you will make wonderful parents to him, but it's not enough to give me peace of mind. What I have turned to is God. I am entrusting him first of all to God. This brings some comfort.

The four-page letter included this, too, drenched in love and heartache: ""I sang to him a lot rather than talking to him. Maybe I was trying not to become too attached. I guess that didn't work, huh?""

In an essay for an online magazine Catapult, Wear shares this and more. He discovered that day that, in their short time together, his birth mother loved to sing to him the song ""You Are My Sunshine."" He writes: ""I immediately thought back to the kindergarten assembly at which I'd sung that song. I thought of how my love of music eventually led me to Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and a whole catalog of songs that my grandparents fell in love to. I sang so many of those songs with them; these were some of my most treasured family memories. How much of this love of music -- one I had found and cultivated myself -- was, in part, a gift from my birth mother?""

Wear's essay is a reflection on hope. As the father of a newborn, he is still discovering things about the birth mother he has never met. Wear is making connections with her, as he holds his little girl in his arms. He writes, remembering the day during Lent last year when he and his wife discovered that they were parents of an unborn baby: ""There is a profound connection between hope and parenthood. Hope requires an openness to possibility, to vulnerability and to potential disappointment."" And Wear adds: ""Whatever I lack, . . . I have found that my history has not left me empty-handed. I, too, have a family legacy to share with my child -- it stretches back to my beginning, when my birth mother would sing to me, an act of audacious, generous, and loving hope as she anticipated my arrival and our parting. It recalls countless car rides with my grandparents. I have carried it forward with the songs I sing to her mother as we dance, or as we do the dishes.""

Wear worked in the White House office of faith-based initiatives when Barack Obama was president and is the author of Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House about the Future of Faith in America. He himself is an instrument of hope, seeking to work on issues (adoption chief among them) that can bring people together, rather than tear us further apart.

It's no mistake or coincidence that Wear's reflection appeared during the penitential season of Lent, and at a time when we're having some brutally graphic public debates about life in its earliest stages. Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe, a friend of Saint Augustine, early bishop and one of the fathers of the Church, instructed: ""Let no one despair of the mercy of God, . . . but let the confidence of the person with hope seek the harbor of penance without faltering in such a way that the humility of the one with hope may drive away the deadly shipwreck of despair.""

In his sharing of some of the most intimate experiences of his life, Wear is recognizing our need for heralds of hope -- he certainly is one, in that humble confidence Fulgentius mentioned. Rather than the prideful exuberance that our media and politics breed through their seeming omnipresence in our lives (which we allow by keeping the screens in front of our faces long beyond what could possibly be helpful to anyone), Wear offers something different, leading with gratitude about the heroic sacrifice of one woman, his birth mother, that has made every day of his life possible. The still-unfolding story of his life and the life of his family is a reminder and a gift to the rest of us that the health of our politics reflects the health of our lives. First things first, and there may be hope for our politics yet.",418,nationalreview.com,Where Charity and Love Prevail | National Review
"Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez aim to disrupt and retool our entire economic and social system.

This week New York Magazine posed an interesting question: Has the ""socialist"" moment in the Democratic party arrived? Maybe so. The popularity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among journalists and social-media types suggests that socialism's appeal is growing. And, of course, we should not underestimate Bernie Sanders's appeal in the Democratic primary.

But before Democrats embrace socialism, they would do well to ponder just what a break from the party's history the Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez faction is proposing. For roughly 70 years, the Democratic party has successfully kept radical forces at bay and, as a consequence, enjoyed political success.

Post-war liberalism, far from being a radical political program, actually had the effect of isolating and minimizing left-wing radicalism in the United States. One could argue that this was liberals' intent -- on both the domestic and the international fronts.

Domestically speaking, the essence of post-war liberalism was to share the bounty of capitalism in a more egalitarian manner. A lot of this was initiated with the New Deal. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, for instance, gave labor unions the right to bargain for better wages and, by implication, allowed a fairer distribution of corporate profits. And while the particulars of post-war liberal programs were novel in some respects -- with their particular emphasis on health care and education -- the Left's agenda remained philosophically similar to FDR's New Deal mission: saving capitalism from itself.

Put aside the merits of this agenda -- whether it has been successful on its own terms, or whether it has produced bad side effects (I am in the latter camp). The point is that this is how the mainstream Left viewed its own project. And in at least one important regard, the agenda was enormously successful: It mostly pushed the radical fringe outside politics.

We've mainly forgotten the 75 years between the Civil War and the Great Depression, and when we do remember them, we think of the era as one of corrupt contentment. But there was a radical undercurrent to the politics of the period; at times, it threatened to drag the whole nation down with it. The Populist party called for government seizure of the railroads in 1892, a proposal that William Jennings Bryan endorsed prior to his run for the presidency in 1908. Socialism was a viable political force in the Midwest during this time -- Milwaukee elected a socialist mayor in 1910, and Eugene V. Debs put together a coalition of urban and agrarian radicals that accounted for more than 5 percent of the presidential vote in 1912. But after the political success of the New Deal, the economic socialists were not a significant force in electoral politics. FDR and his successors produced a politically satisfactory middle ground between laissez-faire capitalism and socialism.

Something similar happened with the Left on foreign policy during the Cold War. The Democratic party adopted a thoroughly anti-Communist stance that had the effect of boxing out those who did not see the Soviet Union as a threat. The decisive contest over the soul of the Left turned out to be the 1944 vice-presidential contest, when a coalition of southern Democrats, Catholics, and soon-to-be Cold Warriors insisted that Vice President Henry Wallace be denied another term. Instead, Democrats settled on Harry Truman as the heir to FDR. Truman adopted an unapologetically pro-American, interventionist foreign policy, while Wallace was basically exiled from the party. Running as an independent in 1948, he won just 2 percent of the vote.

This was an incredibly successful mix of domestic and foreign policies. Regardless of how Barack Obama saw himself (or how the rest of the country saw him), he can mostly be understood as operating within this Democratic tradition, which links him to Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy, Truman, and Roosevelt.

Bernie Sanders is not part of this tradition and does not see himself as belonging to it, either. Although he caucuses with Democrats in Congress, he sees himself as a democratic socialist. His ideology is not the same as that held by early-20th-century progressives, who wanted to control the means of production. But it's close enough, in that the confiscatory tax rates Sanders supports would give the state most of the benefits from private enterprise. His domestic agenda is not intended to stabilize our capitalist system and make it fairer; instead, he explicitly seeks to disrupt it.

Take health care. It was one thing for Truman to propose a national health-insurance program in 1949, when health-care expenditures counted for less than 5 percent of GDP. It is quite another for Sanders to call for Medicare for all in an economy where health care is 18 percent of GDP, as it now is. Similarly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal bears little substantive resemblance to the New Deal, which sought to coordinate the existing forces in society to alleviate the Great Depression for the good of all. Ocasio-Cortez's plan would totally upend society as we have known it.

And as for his foreign policy, Sanders took trips to the USSR, where he publicly criticized the United States. Obviously, the Soviet Union is no more, but a Sanders presidency would fundamentally realign American foreign policy.

The brilliance of the New Deal/post-war liberal project is that it was a progressive agenda for a fundamentally prosperous and reasonably contented people. It was presented to Americans as a way to solve public and social problems without disrupting the pathways of wealth creation and upward mobility that already existed. As Obama said, ""you can keep your health insurance if you like it."" That was a lie, but soothing claims such as this have been essential to the post-war liberal program, which goes something like this: If you're not doing too well, we will help you; if you're doing really, really well, we're going to ask you to pitch in a little more; if you're doing all right, we'll leave you alone.

This is not what Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are promising. They seem intent on disrupting life for every American, in fundamental ways. This is radicalism, and it has never been politically successful in the United States. There is, of course, a first time for everything. But this would be a first in this nation's 225-year history.",419,nationalreview.com,Radicalism Is on the Rise among Democrats | National Review
"Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, a giant bill which the Democrats claim would get big money out of politics.

""Let's show the American people that this is the People's House, not the house of corporate interests and lobbyists and dark money!"" one Democratic lawmaker said.

Not corporate interests! Not lobbyists! We hate them!

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON.

But hang on a second. In all its 444 pages, this bill makes no mention of some obvious ways to control corporate interests and lobbying. Last week, we called for a total ban on foreign government lobbying, and we got a huge reaction.

But the Democrats are perfectly fine with foreign government lobbying. It is not even mentioned in their bill. And no wonder. Lobbyists representing foreign governments donate to Democrats all the time.

Like Edward Newberry, for example. He's a Squire Patton Boggs lobbyist who represents a number of foreign clients, including the Palestinian Authority. In the 2018 cycle, he donated to Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and a ""member of his family"" donated to 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Or Capitol Counsel lobbyist Ann Jablon, who represents a foundation sponsored by the Chinese government and donated to at least 10 Democratic House representatives in the 2018 cycle.

Next example: conflict donors. In my book ""Positive Populism,"" I called for a total ban on conflict donors. I said that all politicians must recuse themselves from any legislative work on any issue involving current or past donors.

But the Democrats are totally fine with special interests bribing the members of Congress who regulate them - it's not even mentioned in their bill. And no wonder: In the 2018 cycle, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., took over $100,000 from the electric utilities industry.

Americans want change. But H.R. 1 is not the change they're looking for. This bill is not for the people, as you claim. It is for the Swamp.

House Democrat and Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith received over $200,000 from defense companies, including Boeing and Northrop Grumman. And House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters took over $300,000 from the financial industry. Unbelievable. And that's only the 2018 cycle!

But what about all the other swampy practices we regularly highlight on ""Swamp Watch""? None of it was touched upon in the Democrats' bill because they thrive off swampy practices, like corporate lobbying. The defense sector gave Democrats over $10 million in the same cycle. The omnibus bill passed and handed hundreds of billions of dollars to defense contractors. Or how about the revolving door between business and government? For the Democrats, it never stops spinning.

For example, Lawrence Roberts was a senior advisor to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who's a current member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Now, Roberts is a partner at lobbying firm Venable, whose 2018 clients included had a $260,000 contract with Lockheed Martin. Or how about Jason Cole - he's the current chief of staff for Rep. Jim Himes, a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Before working for Himes, Cole was a lobbyist for, you guessed it, a financial services company. UBS Americas, to be exact.

The truth is the Democrats want to protect the Swamp, not drain it. They don't really want to change anything. In fact, new Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings gave the game away when he said at the end of the Michael Cohen hearing the other week when he said, ""H.R. 1. Voting rights. Corruption in government ... Come on now! We can do more than one thing, and we have got to get back to normal.""

There you have it. Back to normal. Back to lobbyists writing legislation. Back to big donors literally buying the outcomes they want. Back to bribery. Back to corruption. Back to their swampy ways.

No, Elijah Cummings. We most definitely do not want to get back to normal. Americans want change. But H.R. 1 is not the change they're looking for. This bill is not for the people, as you claim. It is for the Swamp.",420,Fox News,"Steve Hilton: Democrats want to protect the Swamp, not drain it. They don't want to change anything"
"Freshman Congresswoman Katie Hill, Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, shares insight on 'Fox News Sunday.'

If you are shocked at the Democratic Party's timid response to Rep. Ilhan Omar's numerous anti-Semitic remarks, you shouldn't be. It just means you haven't been following Democratic politics, and more specifically, progressive politics, the last few years. This is the end result of a party that has become infected by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement targeting the state of Israel's right to exist, and the progressive movement that has embraced the absurdity of intersectionality and moral equivalency.

There is a reason that Nancy Pelosi lacks the courage to forcefully denounce Omar's rhetoric, and lacks the will to remove her from the Foreign Affairs committee, as the GOP did to one of its own who engaged in racist rhetoric. It's called the politics of self-preservation and expediency.

ILHAN OMAR IS AN ANTI-SEMITE WHO BRANDS CRITICISM OF HER AS ANTI-MUSLIM BIGOTRY - BUT SHE'S THE REAL BIGOT

A not insignificant amount of the progressive base, the small donor base, and grassroots workers of the Democratic Party adhere to the BDS movement. This movement is not simply a movement that disagrees with some of Israel's policies. It is a militant anti-Semitic movement that ultimately seeks to bring down the state of Israel. No other state is targeted the way Israel is, and it is targeted because it is a Jewish state. Apparently Muslim states are fine with the BDS movement, but a Jewish state is not.

Some argue that you can disagree with the state of Israel and not be anti-Semitic. Of course. That's like stating the obvious to the simple-minded: you can disagree with much of what the American government is doing and not be un-American. That's not the point. The point is that when you deny Israel's right to exist as a democratic Jewish state, when you demonize Israel and attempt to delegitimize it, when you use anti-Semitic rhetoric and tropes used by the Nazis, you really are ultimately denying the right of the Jewish people to protect themselves from future genocide. Period. Full stop.

There is something insidious to all of this: the BDS movement has made it acceptable to many on the left to accept anti-Semitism as somewhat normal. BDS really is the gateway drug to anti-Semitism. All one must do is look to college campuses, where the BDS movement has gained a significant foothold. When you hear students and professors call out ""Gas them, burn them and dismantle their power structure. Humanity cannot progress with the parasitic Jew,"" you would be forgiven if you thought you were reading Nazi propaganda. You were not. You were reading a comment made on the anonymous Yik Yak app by someone at the University of Chicago regarding the passage of a BDS motion on the Northwestern campus.

What is clear is that while anti-Semitism is sadly on all sides of the political spectrum in this country, it is only on the left that people advocating anti-Semitism have gained positions of power.

This is a problem not only in the United States, but across the world as well: in January of this year, Justin Trudeau came out forcefully against the BDS movement in Canada, calling it ""anti-Semitic and contrary to 'Canadian values'"" and followed up by ""accusing it of intimidating Jewish students on university campuses.""

What is clear is that while anti-Semitism is sadly on all sides of the political spectrum in this country, it is only on the left that people advocating anti-Semitism have gained positions of power - like, say, an anti-Semite gaining a position on the House Foreign Affairs committee. By not forcefully condemning Omar's anti-Semitism, by allowing her to stay on Foreign Affairs, by not condemning the BDS movement, the Democratic Party is helping mainstream anti-Semitism. What is troubling for students of history, of which it appears many on the left are not, is that the real secret to Hitler's rise to power and acceptance of his politics was making anti-Semitism acceptable among the ""polite middle class"" in Germany.

But at least many Americans still find this unbelievable that a major political party in the United States lacks the courage to name the offender and denounce her comments. It is still unbelievable that not too long ago, the overwhelming majority of Americans, regardless of party affiliation, would have stated loud and definitively, ""Never again!"" But now, confronted with the worldview of Omar, the Democratic response has been, ""It's not that bad.""

Further weakening the Democrats' ability to forcefully condemn Omar is the party's acceptance of intersectionality and moral equivalency. When you claim that every worldview is equally good and acceptable (but you really mean to denounce anything Western), and when you justify anti-Semitism because Omar previously lived in and escaped from persecution in another country, and that her life experience and demographic make her a victim, you lack the ability to definitively denounce such things as anti-Semitism.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Take for example one of the most staggering statements by Democratic leadership, made by majority whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., regarding Omar. He said her experience ""is much more empirical -- and powerful -- than that of people who are generations removed from the Holocaust, Japanese internment camps during WWII and the other violent episodes that have marked history."" And there you have it. In the process of telling the Jewish people to check their privilege, Clyburn somehow believes that Omar's experiences as a Somali refugee are the moral equivalent - actually a morally superior position - to the horror of murdering of six million Jewish people. Rep. Clyburn forgets that Holocaust survivors are still with us, as are their children: one of them sits in the Congress in his caucus.

That, my friends, is how far the Democratic Party has fallen. It is tolerating itself to death. It's become clear that the Democratic Party has become the party of infanticide, socialism and anti-Semitism; in short, a moral cesspool. In its current iteration, it deserves to be deserted in droves by voters.

SEN. MARCO RUBIO FILES BILL TO MAKE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME PERMANENT NATIONWIDE

Trump's trade wars and tariffs are wreaking havoc on working Americans by increasing the cost of living. Food, goods, and products - the necessities of everyday life - have all increased. At the same time, Republicans in Congress are Trump's accomplices giving the wealthiest Americans a massive tax cut paid for by middle class Americans, seniors, and students. Adding insult to injury, many of those same Americans have seen smaller tax refunds too.

Furthermore, Trump has exploded the deficit in two years, adding $8.3 trillion to it largely due to the 2017 tax cut. The same people who are paying the price for Trump's and Republicans' policies are going to be paying for that as well for decades. Adding insult to injury, Trump is paying $12 billion in subsidies to farmers in key 2020 states who are losing their farms and business as a result of his trade policies and tariffs.

The 2020 election should be a debate about making capitalism work for everyone, not just the few. Capitalism is the foundation of our economy and our country. But, it's been exploited to benefit the few rather than the majority. While Trump is rewarding those who need no help he's hurting those he promised to help during the 2016 campaign.

When the deck is stacked decidedly against hard-working Americans, then it's time to reset the rules so everyone can compete again.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one of the most progressive candidates in the 2020 presidential race, proudly proclaims herself to be a capitalist. She also adamantly believes capitalism needs to be reformed. In a bold move last week, Warren introduced a proposal to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google because they are too big and too powerful. She tweeted, ""Today's big tech companies have too much power -- ‚Äätoo much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy... they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation."" Warren often talks about the need for capitalism to have rules and to enforce them. That is exactly the debate we should be having in 2020 - and it is one voters want to hear.

Trump and the Republicans have seized on a few recent examples of those who tout socialism or are flirting with it - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, for instance, and freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

But the real sign of dissatisfaction with capitalism started to emerge in an annual poll of young voters in 2016 by the Harvard Institute of Politics. This poll found that only 19 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 identified themselves as ""capitalists."" A startling statistic, perhaps, until you think about it.

These young voters came of age during the Great Recession. They watched their parents lose their jobs, lose their homes, and many lost everything. As the big banks and others were bailed out to save our economy no one bailed them out. As we crawled out of the recession, some of their families may have gotten back on their feet, but never back to where they were before, and certainly not ahead.

Yet, these are the very people who bailed everyone else out. As the wealthy became even wealthier, these are the families who worked harder than ever and never caught up. And Trump, who promised to help them, has helped only the one percent who need no help.

That's why young voters, and most of America, see the economy as rigged against them. And that is a real threat to Trump and the Republicans in 2020.

"Britain did this month what the European Union and its most important power, Germany, refuse to do: outlaw the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah.

Specifically, London imposed the ban on Hezbollah's so-called political wing following Britain's 2008 ban against Hezbollah's military wing. In doing so, the British government rejected the notion that Hezbollah is a ""two-winged"" group without unified command and control over its terror activities.

Berlin still clings to that delusion. On Friday, the German government rebuffed requests from the US, Israel and a number of Arab countries to outlaw all of Hezbollah.

Europe's split-personality approach to Hezbollah puts it at odds with reality -- not to mention Hezbollah leaders' own view of their group.

In 2012, Hezbollah operatives blew up an Israeli tour bus in Bulgaria, killing five ¬≠Israelis and a Muslim bus driver. In ¬≠response, the EU banned Hezbollah's military wing but not its political wing.

The partial ban prompted Hezbollah spokesman Ibrahim Mousawi to repeat what other top officials of the group have stressed over the years: ""Hezbollah is a single, large organization. We have no wings that are separate from one another.""

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned that an EU designation of the terror group in its entirety would dry up his fundraising in Europe.

But the EU continued to ignore Hezbollah's self-described identity as a unitary organization. The rationale: Europe's, in particular France's and Germany's, desire to continue a ""critical dialogue.""

Their gamble didn't pay off. Hezbollah played a critical role in Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's scorched-earth policy that resulted in the deaths of more than 500,000 Syrians and a flood of refugees into Europe.

To its credit, the UK has now recognized Hezbollah's role in the destruction of Syria and its malign influence across the region. The Netherlands had been the only EU country to outlaw the entire organization, in 2004. Outside Europe, the Arab League, Canada, the United States and ¬≠Israel all consider Hezbollah's entire enterprise to be involved in terrorism.

As the main economic engine of Europe, Germany could influence a change in EU policy toward Hezbollah. Chancellor ¬≠Angela Merkel's administration has hidden behind the cloak of an alleged requirement for EU consensus to delay outlawing Hezbollah's political wing. But the actions by the Dutch, if not the British, show that Berlin could act without EU consensus to brand Hezbollah a terrorist entity.

Germany has long been a hotbed of Hezbollah activity. The organization's representatives raise funds, recruit members and spread a lethal anti-Semitic and jihadist ideology.

""The entire Hezbollah is against"" Germany's Basic Law, the country's interior ministry recently declared, ""because Hezbollah fights the right of the existence of the State of ¬≠Israel with terrorist means. Such an objective is anti-Semitic in nature.""

Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, who announced last year that he went into politics ""because of Auschwitz,"" stresses that everything must be done to protect Jewish life in Europe. Merkel declared in 2008 that Israel's security is ""nonnegotiable"" for her government. Yet Merkel, Maas and the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, refuse to act against Hezbollah.

German officials claim that Merkel's government can't unilaterally prohibit the ¬≠organization. But it has done so with other radical groups.

The real reason Germany (and the EU) hesitate to ban the whole of Hezbollah has to do with appeasing Iran, Hezbollah's sponsor.

Berlin is well aware that Hezbollah is tied at the navel to Tehran. In 2010, Germany's then-ambassador to Iran, Bernd Erbel, said he wanted to advance the ""historical treasure of the German-Iranian friendship.""

That treasured friendship was on display last month when German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sent a warm congratulatory telegram to Tehran to honor the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Islamic Republic. German diplomats attended a celebration event at Iran's ¬≠embassy in Berlin to honor 1979, which brought a radical Islamic social order that is not shy about calling for the destruction of the US and Israel.

Germany, along with the rest of the EU, ¬≠remains wedded to various fictions about the nature of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hezbollah. But Berlin and Brussels can't deny the growing international consensus: There is only one Hezbollah, and it pursues its political ends through terror.",423,New York Post,Europe's delusions on Hezbollah
"The Democrats' Election-Reform Bill Is an Unconstitutional, Authoritarian Power Grab

At some level, you have to give House Democrats some credit for ambition. They may have just sent to the Senate the most comprehensively unconstitutional bill in modern American history. It's called the ""For the People Act,"" and it's a legislative buffet of bad ideas.

The alleged purpose of the bill, H.R. 1, is to ""expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for public servants."" In reality, the bill represents an extraordinary federal power grab. At every turn, it grants federal regulators more power. Time and again, it renders federal election law more complex -- creating a chilling effect on political communication through sheer uncertainty and confusion.

The free speech problems are so obvious that free-speech organizations on the left and right are united in opposition. Comprehensive analyses from the Institute for Free Speech and the American Civil Liberties Union are worth reading in their entirety and raise remarkably similar concerns.

At a time of extraordinary public harassment, boycotts, intimidating public shame campaigns, the act would expand financial disclosure requirements, including in some circumstances requiring public disclosure of the names and addresses even of donors who did not know about or perhaps even support the political message of the organization they funded. Donors may give money, for example, to fund one aspect of an organization's mission only to be involuntarily exposed as a ""political donor"" when the organization chooses -- without the donor's knowledge or consent -- to mention a politician by name in a different context. As the ACLU points out, ""it is unfair to hold donors responsible for every communication in which an organization engages.""

Moreover, in the effort to further limit ""coordination"" between candidates and political action committees, the bill sets forth language so broad that, as the ACLU explains, it affects communications that ""merely refer to a candidate or an opponent to a candidate 120 days before an election or 60 days before a primary or a caucus."" The Institute for Free Speech's Bradley Smith argues that, with such language, ""the goal seems to be to limit discussion of candidates to the candidates and parties themselves, at the expense of the public at large.""

Compounding the problems, the bill revamps the Federal Election Commission, making practical partisan control a near-certainty. While no more than two members of one party could be appointed to the new, five-person commission, it would be easy to achieve ideological control by appointing a like-minded ""independent"" to break the logjam. As a result, two Democrats and an independent socialist could control the interpretation and enforcement of H.R. 1's extraordinarily broad and vague provisions. Under current law, the FEC is supposed to have six commissioners, with no more than three of the same party. It takes a vote of four for the commission to act, so the commission can't act without at least some degree of bipartisan consensus.

In addition to controlling political speech, the bill would transform the federal government into the sugar daddy of American politics by dramatically increasing federal funding of campaigns. Are Democrats truly worried about the influence of ""big money"" over politicians, or do they simply want to ensure that the government is the donor?

The bill would also strip from the states the ability to draw their own congressional districts (requiring instead that they be drawn by an independent commission), and the ability to engage in prudent, constitutionally appropriate measures to ensure the accuracy of their voter rolls. Moreover, it directly contradicts the text of the 14th Amendment, which grants states the ability to prohibit or restrict the voting rights of felons.

The bill also expands the definition of ""lobbyist"" far beyond the bounds of reason -- to include even those individuals who provide ""legislative, political, and strategic counseling services"" to actual lobbyists, even if the person who provides ""counseling services"" never communicates with the relevant government officials. As the Heritage Foundation's Hans von Spakovsky explained in his written testimony opposing H.R. 1, the language is broad enough that it could even encompass casual conversations at social gatherings.

But there's a larger concern with the bill beyond the multiple constitutional problems with individual provisions. Taken together, it directly contradicts two foundational virtues of the American constitution: its protection of political speech and its respect for federalism. The ""For the People Act"" is a legislative megaphone amplifying the Democrats' belief that political speech is somehow particularly suspect. Political speakers are particularly suspicious.

The Democrats seem to believe that political speech is just too dangerous to be unrestrained. It has to be micromanaged, regulated by technocrats until it is directed into its government-approved lanes. This is of course exactly what incumbent politicians tend to prefer. They want predictable debates, reliable funding streams, and (above all) power -- including the power to punish their opponents.

Finally, federalism isn't just valuable as the ""laboratory of democracy"" (though that is valuable), it also recognizes the reality that American states have different cultures and different priorities. Drawing legislative districts according to state priorities allows each state to shape its federal delegation the way the people of the state dictate, not according to Washington's demands.

Throughout the Trump years, Democrats have raised multiple alarms over the alleged authoritarianism of the Trump administration, and while we have not agreed with the propriety of all the administration's actions, nothing it has proposed or enacted is as alarming as H.R. 1. This bill is a frontal assault on the Constitution, and the nation should be grateful that the Republican-controlled Senate will almost certainly block it from becoming law.",424,nationalreview.com,"The Democrats' Election-Reform Bill Is an Unconstitutional, Authoritarian Power Grab | National Review"
"Gilbert T. Sewall, contributor: I have been reading defense expert John D. Caldwell's Anatomy of Victory, a critique of U.S. military strategy endorsed by Mark Helprin. Caldwell compares planning and operations in World War II to later limited wars that have nonetheless had enormous national consequences: Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. His detailed, well-documented account indicates that the U.S. forces repeatedly suffer from ill-conceived strategies and increasing lack of realism. His point of view is more hawkish than mine, but the critique of limited war is knowledgeable and compelling. It is an argument that others, more informed on military affairs than I am, heed.

I am also reading Timothy P. Carney's sharply thought essay in the Washington Examiner adapted from his new book, Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse. Carney writes on layers of society and institutions that enable a common culture and social cooperation. on layers of society and institutions that enable a common culture and social cooperation. Communities have lost the connective tissue that ties individuals together, channeling Robert Nisbet and Robert Putnam. Such a support complex is indispensable for raising a family and getting ahead, Carney suggests. But the middle layer of society is so eroded that many people, ""especially those most affected by its absence, can no longer imagine it or see its value."" The elites don't care, favoring instead immigration, free trade, and global adventure -- or possibly white Christian deposition. ""The core Trump voters weren't the people dying of opioids, obviously. They weren't even necessarily the unhealthy ones. They weren't necessarily the people drawing disability payments or dropping out of the workforce. Trump's core voters were these people's neighbors,"" Carney writes. ""Trump's win, specifically his wins in the early primaries, is best explained by his support in places where communities are in disarray."" Those communities remain fractured and unstable in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. This grim state of affairs comes when televised federal politics alone captures the nation's attention, which of course is part of the problem.

Scott Beauchamp, contributor: I'm going admit it upfront: I wasn't ready for Italian publisher and man of letters Roberto Calasso's The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony. A few weeks ago I finished his nonfiction masterpiece Literature and the Gods, a sumptuous foray into the history of transcendent beings in literature and their disappearance (or transformation?) during the Age of Reason. It was challenging and breathtaking in scope. But it didn't really prepare me for Cadmus, which is all that but even more so. I suppose it's a work of ""fiction"", but it's suffused with Greek history and mythology and, of course, complex ideas eloquently stated. Like any great work, it's so unique that it's genre-bending. A genre of it's own, really. And my ""I read Edith Hamilton a few times"" knowledge-level of myth bent and then broke under Calasso's vast learning. I had to read the book with Google at the ready, in other words. Gentle reader, let me tell you, it was worth it. A couple quotes to enter into evidence:

With time, men and gods would develop a common language made up of hierogamy and sacrifice . . . . And, when it became a dead language, people started talking about mythology.

"When the GOP madly went after President Andrew Johnson, Senator Edward G. Ross ruined his own career to thwart them.

As Robert Mueller's pending report looms heavily over Washington, many are darkly speculating about a new era in our history. When have there been so many investigations, such rank partisanship, such indifference to justice and the rule of law?

Actually we have been here before.

The myth that our present moment is somehow more scandalous than any other is easily dispelled by reading John F. Kennedy's book Profiles in Courage, which details the political bravery of eight largely unsung individuals from congressional history.

One story in particular stands out as the perfect antidote for our time: that of Edmund G. Ross, senator from Kansas. In 1868, the United States came perilously close to impeaching its seventeenth president, Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, because the Republican majority in Congress was at odds with him over how to handle the defeated Southern states. Ross bucked his party, followed his conscience, and cast a vote against articles of impeachment. He was vilified at the time; decades later, he would be hailed as having saved the republic.

While previous impeachment efforts had been defeated, on February 24, 1868, the House of Representatives adopted articles of impeachment by a tremendous margin -- every single Republican voted in the affirmative. With that hurdle cleared, the charges moved to the Senate, where they were presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Ross was a Republican, and was naturally expected to support Johnson's impeachment.

""Public opinion in the nation ran heavily against the President; he had intentionally broken the law and dictatorially thwarted the will of Congress!"" writes Kennedy.

After the president was effectively indicted by the House, the Senate trial proceeded and high drama riveted the nation. ""It was a trial to rank with all the great trials in history -- Charles I before the High Court of Justice, Louis XVI before the French Convention, and Warren Hastings before the House of Lords,"" writes Kennedy. Yet there were two elements missing: ""the actual cause for which the President was being tried was not fundamental to the welfare of the nation; and the defendant himself was at all times absent.""

The actual causes for impeachment sound somewhat obscure to today's ears, although the tenth article, which alleged that Johnson had delivered ""intemperate, inflammatory, and scandalous harangues...against Congress [and] the laws of the United States,"" sounds positively Trumpian. The first eight articles concerned the removal of Edwin M. Stanton as secretary of war in supposed violation of the Tenure of Office Act. The ninth article alleged that Johnson's conversation with a general had violated an Army appropriations act. The eleventh was something of a catch-all for the rest.

The counsel for the president argued convincingly that the Tenure of Office Act was unconstitutional. And even if there had been a violation of the law, Stanton would have needed to submit to being dismissed and then sued for his rights in the courts -- something that had not happened.

From Profiles in Courage:

...as the trial progressed, it became increasingly apparent that the impatient Republicans did not intend to give the President a fair trial on the formal issues upon which the impeachment was drawn, but intended instead to depose him from the White House on any grounds, real or imagined, for refusing to accept their policies. Telling evidence in the President's favor was arbitrarily excluded. Prejudgment on the part of most Senators was brazenly announced. Attempted bribery and other forms of pressure were rampant. The chief interest was not in the trial or the evidence, but in the tallying of votes necessary for conviction.

At the time, there were 54 members of the Senate, which meant 36 votes were required to secure the two thirds necessary for Johnson's conviction. There were 12 Democratic senators, so the 42 Republicans could afford only six defections.

The mood and tenor in Washington, according to David Miller DeWitt's The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson, was that of a city under siege. ""The dominant part of the nation seemed to occupy the position of public prosecutor, and it was scarcely in the mood to brook delay for trial or to hear the defense.""

The city was thronged by the ""politically dissatisfied and swarmed with representatives of every state of the Union, demanding in a practically united voice the deposition of the President,"" writes Kennedy. ""The footsteps of anti-impeaching Republicans were dogged from the day's beginning to its end and far into the night, with entreaties, considerations, and threats.""

Ross and other doubters were ""daily pestered, spied upon, and subjected to every form of pressure. Their residences were carefully watched, their social circles suspiciously scrutinized, and their every move and companions secretly marked in special notebooks. They were warned in the party press, harangued by their constituents, and sent dire warnings threatening political ostracism and even assassination.""

The New York Tribune reported that Ross in particular was ""mercilessly dragged this way and that by both sides, hunted like a fox night and day and badgered by his own colleagues....""

While both sides publicly claimed Ross as their own, the senator himself kept a careful silence. His brother received a letter offering $20,000 if he would reveal Ross' mind. The morning of the fateful vote, spies followed Ross to breakfast, and 10 minutes before the vote, a colleague from Kansas warned him that support for ""acquittal would mean trumped up charges and his political death.""

That day in the Senate, as Ross would later write, ""the galleries were packed. Tickets of admission were at an enormous premium. The House had adjourned and all of its members were in the Senate chamber. Every chair on the Senate floor was filled....""

The broad eleventh article of impeachment would command the first vote. By the time the call came to Ross, 24 ""guilty"" votes had already been pronounced. As Kennedy writes, ""Ten more were certain and one other practically certain. Only Ross's vote was needed to obtain the thirty-six votes necessary to convict the President. But not a single person in the room knew how this young Kansan would vote.""

""I almost literally looked down into my open grave,"" writes Ross. ""Friendships, position, fortune, everything that makes life desirable to an ambitious man were about to be swept away by the breath of my mouth, perhaps forever. It is not strange that my answer was carried waveringly over the air and failed to reach the limits of the audience, or or that repetition was called for....""

""Then came the answer again in a voice that could not be misunderstood -- full, final, definite, unhesitating and unmistakeable: 'Not guilty.' The deed was done, the President saved, the trial as good as over and the conviction lost. The remainder of the roll call was unimportant; conviction had failed by the margin of a single vote and a general rumbling filled the chamber....""

When the second and third articles of impeachment were read 10 days later, Ross also pronounced the president ""not guilty.""

Neither Ross nor any of the other six Republicans who voted for Johnson's acquittal were ever reelected to the Senate. When they returned to Kansas, Ross and his family were ostracized, attacked, and impoverished.

Kennedy writes:

Who was Edmund G. Ross? Practically nobody. Not a single public law bears his name, not a single history book includes his picture, not a single list of Senate ""greats"" mentions his service. His one heroic deed has been all but forgotten. ...Ross...chose to throw [his future in politics] away for one act of conscience.

Yet even if he fell into obscurity, history would vindicate Ross. Twenty years after the fateful vote, Congress repealed the Tenure of Office Act, and the Supreme Court later held that ""the extremes of that episode in our government"" were unconstitutional.

Prior to Ross's death, the American public realized its errors too, and the same Kansas papers that had once denounced and defamed Ross declared that his ""courage"" had ""saved"" the country ""from calamity greater than war, while it consigned him to a political martyrdom, the most cruel in our history....""

Kennedy does a wonderful job recounting this momentous episode, with the rich suspense and colorful imagery that it deserves. Ross's words jump from the page as if they were written for our own age, and his bravery in the face of partisan political pressure has withstood the test of time.

To end with Ross's own words:

In a large sense, the independence of the executive office as a coordinate branch of the government was on trial.... If...the President was to step down...a disgraced man and a political outcast...upon insufficient proofs and from partisan considerations, the office of President would be degraded, cease to be a coordinate branch of the government, and ever after be subordinated to the legislative will. If Andrew Johnson were acquitted by a nonpartisan vote... America would pass the danger point of partisan rule and that intolerance which so often characterizes the sway of great majorities and makes them dangerous.

We should bear that in mind today.",426,The American Conservative,This Man Stopped a Runaway Impeachment
"A new book by a campaign aide to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez casts her upset victory over former congressman Joseph Crowley in starkly ethnic terms -- and reveals how the 10-term incumbent got sandbagged into missing a key debate just two weeks before the election.

Latino activist Ramon Ramirez plans to self-publish his memoir of last year's election under the title ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Democrats' Surprise.""

A draft manuscript provided exclusively to The Post shows Ramirez describing Crowley's 6-foot-4 height as ""unfortunately proportional to the despotic and solemn air with which he demanded to be revered like the 'Celtic king.' ""

In recounting Ocasio-Cortez's defeat Crowley, the son of Irish immigrants, Ramirez also crows: ""We stripped the Celtic king of a crown that he had received without political or community merit.""

Ramirez details how he and a fellow official of the Pan-American Democratic Association of Queens, William Salgado, worked with Ocasio-Cortez to circumvent Crowley's refusal to debate the challenger by scheduling a bilingual, June 11 showdown at the Jackson Heights Jewish Center -- without informing Crowley's camp.

Ramirez says he had fliers printed and posted before notifying the opposition, which complained of a scheduling conflict and offered to send a surrogate in Crowley's place.

But the organizers refused, and Ocasio-Cortez wound up having the floor to herself in front of an audience of more than 200 people -- and next to an empty chair with Crowley's name on it.

In his book, Ramirez, 61, describes himself as the ""grandfather"" among Ocasio-Cortez's volunteer supporters, and relates how taken he was with the candidate when he and Salgado met her at the Jax Inn diner in Jackson Heights for an April 22 breakfast meeting.

In a lengthy portion of purple prose that seems more fit for a romance novel, Ramirez recalls the ""radiant smile"" and ""big, black eyes"" of Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 is the youngest member of Congress.

""She was dressed in a black, printed jacket that was fitted tight around the waist, which gave a fantastic shape to her slender body,"" he writes.

""I opened my eyes and then my lips to express our chemistry, trying to leave the pleasant taste that my message was memorable. She never left a smile hidden, nor did her long lashes make the slightest attempt to stop the emotion from appearing in her eyes: two suns that were always ready to cast her incandescence toward the world around her.""

But while likening Ocasio-Cortez to the Greek goddess Artemis and Joan of Arc, Ramirez -- a self-described socialist who boasts of having studied in Russia -- says it was her progressive politics that really won his heart as she pledged her support for Medicare for all, free college tuition and de-funding ICE.

""This is not a project by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We are part of a socialist movement at the national level,"" he recalls her saying.

"As we shall see, the Post has just put its reportorial knife deep into the chest of Michael Sanchez, the brother of Bezos' girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, whom Bezos and the Post seem to view as the bad guy, the one responsible for the embarrassing leaks to the National Enquirer.

For his part, Michael Sanchez says that he is innocent, mostly, and he has own take on recent events -- and yet on February 26, he was flattened by 2,500 words of fresh Post reportage.

Then on March 4, the Times jumped in with a piece headlined, ""How Jeff Bezos Went to Hollywood and Lost Control."" The story wasn't that bad, and yet still, perhaps the Times is enjoying the spectacle of the owner of the rival liberal national newspaper paper suffering some. As the Times put it, ""Mr. Bezos is at the center of an honest-to-God melodrama, full of salacious revelations, family betrayals and international intrigue.""

Hmm. Those words ""international intrigue"" certainly do fit Bezos. The Amazon honcho does, indeed, have a lot of power. And that gets Virgil thinking . . .

You've probably noticed it, too: Jeff Bezos looks a lot like Ernst Blofeld, the fictional villain in several of the early James Bond movies. (And to bring things more up to date, Blofeld also was the inspiration for Dr. Evil, as portrayed by Mike Myers in the Austin Powers films.)

Of course, nobody is accusing Bezos and his global company, Amazon, of doing anything like what Blofeld and his international outfit, SPECTRE, were imagined to be up to.

Yet still, as the founder and chief executive of the world's second-most valuable corporation -- who has also spent billions to develop his own private rocket company -- Bezos is a movie-worthy figure, and he has had his recent moment of notoriety. Indeed, his response to that notorious moment has revealed the full extent of his planetary potency.

That moment started with the January 9 announcement that he and his wife were getting a divorce. Okay, so divorce itself isn't notorious anymore, but the very next day, the National Enquirer published some lurid details, complete with paparazzi photos, about Bezos' affair with Los Angeles TV personality Lauren Sanchez.

Soon thereafter, no less than the president of the United States, Donald Trump, weighed in with a snarky tweet:

Trump, of course, has long sniped at Bezos and the newspaper he bought in 2013, the Washington Post. Trump believes the Post is biased against him and his presidency and, furthermore, that Amazon has been getting a sweetheart deal on shipping rates from the U.S. Postal Service. Meanwhile, Trump is known to be close to David Pecker, the chief of American Media Inc. (AMI), publisher of the Enquirer.

On January 21, the Enquirer struck again, publishing racy text messages between Bezos and Sanchez. By now the rumor mill was going strong: not only about Bezos, his marriage, his company -- and his judgment -- but also about any possible Enquirer connection to Trump. Moreover, there were rumors that the government of Saudi Arabia might be involved because the Saudis and the Post have been in a feud since a Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul last October. And to complicate things further, the Saudis and the Trump family, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are known to be tight.

Then, on February 7, Bezos posted his account of the Enquirer story, including the sensational allegation that the tabloid had tried to blackmail him over lewd personal photos that it had obtained.

Indeed, not only did Bezos give his side of the story, but he also -- using the authority of his well-known celebrity security consultant, Gavin de Becker -- threw in four mentions of Trump and five mentions of Saudi Arabia.

So while the story was often played for laughs -- sample headline, ""Bezos Exposes Pecker"" -- the underlying narrative could be vastly more serious.

Bezos' implication seems clear: Trump and the Saudis are somehow tied to the Enquirer's scoops. Indeed, as if there were any need to juice things up further, it was even suggested by others -- although far from proven -- that the Saudis had used Israeli spyware to hack Bezos.

So by now, we can see that we have the makings of a new James Bond-ish saga: The world's richest man, owner of one of the nation's most important newspapers-a man willing to play hardball with the largest metropolis in the U.S., New York City, over a new corporate location, which he will now put elsewhere-now finds himself stalked, and perhaps even hacked, by a prominent tabloid publication-which he reportedly considered buying, as a way of shutting down the story. In the meantime, even as multi-billion-dollar divorce proceedings begin, insinuations and accusations swirl around the president of the United States, as well as an exotically wealthy foreign government. And oh yes: All of this can be further connected, maybe, to the special counsel investigation of Robert Mueller, who seems to be casting a wide international net.

Indeed, Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, who admittedly is becoming Shepard Smith-ian in his anti-Trump stance, says that the blowback from the Enquirer story could doom Trump. (For what it's worth, Napolitano's disdain for Trump now seems to extend far beyond legal issues; he disdains Trump for just about everything.)

So will Mueller, in fact, get involved in the Bezos-Pecker story? How 'bout the Trump-loathing Democrats who now control the House? To borrow the Enquirer's old slogan, ""Inquiring minds want to know.""

Yet there's one additional element to this story that never entered into the Bond formula: The Main Stream Media has chosen to lionize Blofeld -- oops, I mean Bezos.

Needless to say, the Post has always been in the bag for its owner -- typical headline: ""Jeff Bezos stands his ground."" (And all the others are just as puffy.) Yet other media outlets, too, are giving Bezos the hero treatment. Here's CNN's Brian Stelter:

His security chief's probe and the Enquirer's panicked reaction enabled Bezos, through a blog post, to reframe the story -- making him out to be a journalistic hero rather than an embarrassed tech exec.

Indeed, Kelly McBride of the Poynter Center, a journalism think tank, said of Bezos, ""I think he changed the first line of his obituary from Silicon Valley billionaire to First Amendment defender.""

Yes, much or most of this exaltation of Bezos is due to his potential role, journalists hope, as the man who can help bring down Trump.

Yet there's also the undeniable magnetism of Bezos' money and power. That was the point of a February 8 column in the Seattle Times headlined, ""How Amazon gets whatever it wants."" In the words of columnist Danny Westneat:

It does say something about American culture and politics today that the multibillionaire wannabe playboy with the penis pic peccadillo is the good guy in the story.

Continuing, Westneat marveled at that February 7 blog post of Bezos, the one headlined, ""No thank you, Mr. Pecker,"" in which Bezos recorded that Pecker and AMI had made him an ""an offer I couldn't refuse"" -- that being a reference to another famous movie villain, the Corleone crime family:

Bezos was channeling ""The Godfather,"" in which an offer you can't refuse means you wake up with a butchered horse head in your bed. That Bezos mocked this and trumped it, even while acknowledging that others might be forced to knuckle under, was a raw demonstration of the rarefied leverage and power Amazon enjoys at the tippy top of our society.

As for the ""tippy top of our society,"" it seems that Bezos, operating from his commanding vantage point, can make things happen -- even inside the federal government's executive branch, which his arch-enemy, Trump, presumably leads.

The Amazon man's clout became even more manifest when we saw this headline from Bloomberg on February 8: ""Bezos's Story Spurs U.S. Prosecutors' Scrutiny of AMI."" So we can see: It's as if Bezos' allegation is now guiding the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

And now comes that big new Washington Post story, the one painting Michael Sanchez as a schemer and a conniver, and perhaps also a bit crazy. The Post quotes Sanchez, who seemed, bizarrely enough, to be happy to share with the Bezos-owned publication:

Since January 7th, I've been accused by 'anonymous' sources and leaky 'Amazon investigators' of just about everything, including involvement in an international conspiracy theory involving President Trump, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and conservative operatives trying to 'take down' Jeff Bezos.

Yes, it appears that Team Bezos -- a team that includes the Post -- have decided that Michael Sanchez is the leaker; in other words, Bezos and his people blame Michael, not Lauren, for the original leaks. Actually, many reports hold that Lauren was involved, too, if only through carelessness; it's been reported that she showed some embarrassing material to her friends, and as they say, loose lips sink, well, you know.

And yet for whatever reason -- true love? larger game? -- the Bezosians have chosen to keep the focus on Michael, to whom Lauren reportedly no longer speaks.

After all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.

Of course, the focus on Michael doesn't mean that the Bezosians aren't still going after Pecker, Trump, and whoever else. After all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.

So will Michael Sanchez be able to tell his side of the story? He has his own explanations and theories, which seem to focus on, for example, the supposedly nefarious role of de Becker, Bezos' security adviser.

Sure, Michael Sanchez can talk all he wants, but it seems likely that the MSM will treat him harshly, now that Bezos and the Post have helped to further stamp him as an unlovable Trump lover.

It's impossible to know where all these allegations and investigations will lead -- other than, of course, to some great spy thrillers to come, with or without James Bond.

The truth, of course, is that Amazon has always been in the middle of the high-stakes digital economy, and none of that seems as innocent as it once did. For instance, Amazon is now the third-largest digital advertising platform in America, behind only Google and Facebook -- and we know about them.

Moreover, Amazon is a big player, too, in cloud computing, including for the Pentagon; in fact, Bezos' company is currently embroiled in a $10 billion legal battle with another mysterious corporate giant, Oracle, complete with flying allegations of improper influencing.

No doubt Amazon is paying plenty of lawyers to keep everything it does deemed as legal, and yet it's still the case, in the icy words of Breitbart News' Charlie Nash, ""Amazon Helped Create the Invasion of Privacy Jeff Bezos Now Protests."" Yet all that aside, as far as the establishment media is concerned, Bezos, because he's anti-Trump, can do no wrong.

Surely, flying high on a private jet to somewhere, Bezos is having a good laugh about that. You know, a good Blofeldian laugh.",428,Breitbart,"Virgil: Bond Villain Jeff Bezos Shaken, Not Stirred"
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rejects calls to resign amid growing scandal

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing controversy over whether his public image as a champion of political correctness matches his private actions, in the wake of a string of resignations, including two high-profile women ministers in Trudeau's Cabinet, among them Canada's first indigenous justice minister.

The former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, said Trudeau and senior members of his government pressured her in a case involving a major Canadian engineering company accused of corruption related to its business dealings in Libya. Trudeau reportedly leaned on the attorney general to instruct prosecutors to reach the equivalent of a plea deal, which would avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, because he felt that jobs were at stake.

""I was not aware of that erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been,"" Trudeau, who stopped short of an apology, said of the resignations during a news conference in Ottawa on Thursday. ""Ultimately, I believe our government will be stronger for having wrestled with these issues.""

A federal election in Canada is scheduled for later this year.

Trudeau had promised transparency while describing himself as a feminist determined to right the wrongs against Canada's indigenous people. Women make up half of his cabinet.

""He depicted himself as a feminist, as someone who believes in indigenous reconciliation, and then you have two of his top female Cabinet ministers resign, and they are depicting him in a very different light,"" Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal, said.

Eddie Goldenberg, a former adviser to former Prime Minister Jean Chretien, said: ""There is a political correctness here. Nobody wants to go after an indigenous woman minister. It's become politically incorrect to question the former minister.""

JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S GOVERNMENT HIT WITH ANOTHER CABINET MINISTER RESIGNATION AS CORRUPTION ROW INTENSIFIES

Trudeau has said he asked Wilson-Raybould to revisit her decision not to instruct prosecutors and said she agreed to consider that. He denied applying any inappropriate pressure, saying he and his officials only were pointing out that prosecution could endanger thousands of jobs.

SNC-Lavalin has pleaded not guilty to fraud and corruption charges related to allegations it paid about $35 million in bribes to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011.

""It's a pseudo-scandal... What the hell? You are doing business in Libya and you are not bribing?"" said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. ""It does suggest to me that the director of public prosecutions... is also nuts. And so is Wilson-Raybould. These people are delusional.""

Wilson-Raybould was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister in January as part of a Cabinet shuffle by Trudeau. She has testified that she believed she lost the justice job because she did not give in to ""sustained"" pressure to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

That solution would have avoided a potential criminal conviction that would bar the company from receiving any federal government business for a decade. The company is a major employer in Quebec, Trudeau's home province. It has about 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

The company publicly led the lobbying charge for a law that allows for deferred prosecution agreements as a way to resolve the criminal charges it faces. The new attorney general has not ruled out approving a settlement.

Wilson-Raybould has said herself that the pressure from Trudeau and others was not illegal and that she was not explicitly instructed to do a remediation agreement.

He added, ""My constituents would want him impeached. I have a largely African American district, and that is probably the demographic group that most sees Trump for what he is -- that is a liar who is insensitive to people of need. Overall I think it's not nearly as strong as it is in my district. We look at polls and public reception. The big thing is look at how Republicans in the Senate are responding. As long as they continue to be acolytes and following lemmings of the cliff, we will not be able to get a conviction and impeachment. We can't get an impeachment through the Senate. If we don't do that, it's an action that has merit because it will bring out a lot of the truth about what this president has done for his personal interest and what he has done to sacrifice our national interest and the rule of law. We will not get a conviction. It might set some people to feel the Trump base will come out stronger politically. It is a tight rope because of the politics of it. The Republicans seem to always talk about the thoughts that Democrats want impeachment, which makes me think they think it will also help them politically.

"He joins a potentially crowded field of Democratic candidates

The issue of reparations for African-Americans has come front and center among the nascent Democratic presidential field, with candidates supporting ideas on everything from free college tuitions to handing out checks for the family members of former slaves.

Juli√°n Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama, said on Sunday that he was not ruling out direct payments to African-Americans for the legacy of slavery - in a move that separates him from his fellow Democratic challengers.

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union"" from his home state of Texas - where the former San Antonio mayor is attending the South By Southwest Festival along with a number of other Democratic candidates - Castro questioned why there is opposition to paying African-Americans for the enslavement of their ancestors.

GROWING NUMBER OF 2020 DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'

""If under the Constitution we compensate people because we take their property, why wouldn't you compensate people who actually were property?"" Castro said.

Other candidates are discussing tax credits and other subsidies, rather than direct payments for the labor and legal oppression of slaves and their descendants. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would put resources such as ""Medicare-for-all"" and tuition-free college into distressed communities.

Castro balked at this and said he doesn't think that's the proper argument for reparations if ""a big check needs to be written for a whole bunch of other stuff.""

Later Sunday, Castro was joining Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper at the South by Southwest Festival for appearances before their party's ascendant young and liberal wing.

Inslee told CNN that while in office, ""I have been very, very committed to making this a more just and open and tolerant society. And that's one of the reasons Washington is so successful.""

"As someone who recently celebrated a birthday, I know it's hard to decide.

The easy solution is an ice cream cake.

Head to Baskin-Robbins. Dairy Queen. Carvel. All we need is ice cream cake.

Congressional Republicans may need to enlist the services of Fudgie the Whale themselves. They too face a dessert dilemma. Ice cream or cake? Funds for a border wall? Or money for a military spending priority in their state or district?

This is where Fudgie comes in.

President Trump's national emergency declaration plunders various appropriations silos, which Congress targeted for specific Pentagon and ""Military Construction"" projects. The national emergency redistributes money for the wall. GOPers want the wall. But they also don't want President Trump to pilfer their pet project back home.

So, maybe the best solution to the quandary is the appropriations equivalent of an ice cream cake.

All lawmakers know right now are the general pots of money from which the Trump administration will loot funds for the wall. But everyone's in the dark when it comes to specifics.

""I asked for the particulars,"" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., after having breakfast at the Pentagon with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan.

Democratic leaders of the House Appropriations and Armed Services Committees also wrote to Shanahan demanding what programs were on the chopping block.

""We request that you produce the requested documents and information no later than March 21, 2019,"" wrote the Democrats.

This is what happens when the power of the purse is ceded to the executive. No one on Capitol Hill knows what's going on.

The Senate is cruising toward following the House's lead and voting to terminate the national emergency. The House already voted to undo the president's action. The Senate will follow suit. At least four Senate Republicans will join all 47 Senate Democrats to cease the national emergency. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is among the four public GOP yeas. Paul says there are about ten other GOPers who will likely vote to halt the national emergency.

""If there is four, there's ten,"" said one Republican senator to Fox.

But there aren't enough votes in the House or Senate to override a prospective veto by Trump. Sixty-seven yeas are required in the Senate to override a presidential veto.

However, that's why the list of ""particulars,"" as Shelby put it, is so important. If senators actually had the concrete information at their fingertips as to which military projects the administration may raid for the wall, it's possible even more senators could vote to rebuff Trump.

If you're for the wall, perhaps that's a good argument to withhold the list until after the Senate's taken the vote.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, says he'd like to see the docket ahead of time.

""I would certainly support that. I know a number of people who probably would,"" said Romney.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., keeps saying that Republicans are having a ""spirited discussion"" about the vote to disapprove of the national emergency declaration and potential impacts on key military projects. McConnell backed Mr. Trump's decision to declare the national emergency in an effort to avoid a second government shutdown. But McConnell adds ""I advised the president not to take this route."" The Kentucky Republican also says he doesn't ""have a solution as to how this ends."" The only thing that's clear is the Senate will vote to reject the national emergency declaration, tempting President Trump to issue his first veto.

A vote to overturn the resolution is yet another example of Senate GOP dissension when it comes to the president. In recent months, Republican senators broke with the president on a speedy withdrawal from Syria, how the administration dealt with Saudi Arabia following the death of Jamal Khashoggi and the cancellation of some Russian sanctions. Fox is told Trump was close to facing a ""jailbreak"" of GOP defections had the government not re-opened when it did following the shutdown.

A vote to overturn the resolution is yet another example of Senate GOP dissension when it comes to the president.

If the Senate approves the package, the House and Senate are aligned and the package goes to President Trump, begging for the veto.

President Obama vetoed his first piece of legislation after only 11 months on the job. President George W. Bush never vetoed a bill until he was in office for five-and-a-half years. President Bill Clinton didn't use a veto until two-and-a-half years into his presidency.

Presidents have only vetoed 2,500 pieces of legislation in the history of the republic. But the Founders wanted to give Congress one last chance to go over the head of the executive. That's a veto override.

One of the few things more rare than a veto is a successful veto override.

The gambit requires a two-thirds vote by both bodies of Congress. That's 67 votes in the Senate, provided all 100 senators cast ballots. And 427 House members cast ballots on the bill to block the national emergency last month. So the yardstick there is 285 yeas. There were 245 members who voted in favor of the bill. Thus, the House fell 40 votes short.

We are not expecting a successful override of a prospective veto of the national emergency. The math simply doesn't work.

The last unsuccessful attempt to override a veto came in January 2016. President Barack Obama vetoed a Republican effort to repeal ObamaCare. The House voted 241-186, well short of the 285 yeas needed to override. The maneuver never went to the Senate since the override maneuver failed in the House.

Note that the vote to override is based on how many lawmakers take part in the override effort itself, not how many members voted on the bill when it passed both bodies. So, determining a precise number required to override is impossible until the veto override vote concludes.

The last successful veto override came in September 2016. Obama vetoed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. The measure allowed families of 9/11 victims to sue those responsible or the attacks, including Saudi Arabia. The Senate voted 97-1 to override Obama; 66 votes were needed. The House voted 348-77 with one lawmaker voting present. And 284 yeas were needed for the override.

The potential veto override attempt will only go to the House, since that's the body which originated the disapproval legislation of the president's national emergency declaration. If the House comes up short with the override initiative, the effort dies there. It never moves to the Senate.

That's an advantage for some Republican senators. They can be for the national emergency. Oppose Mr. Trump plundering money for the wall from projects important to them and know they'll never have to cast a vote to override the expected veto. GOP senators can spin their votes and positions any way they want.

It's the ice cream cake of politics. Having it both ways. Getting ice cream and cake, wrapped into one.",432,Fox News,"For Republicans, national emergency vote brings a dessert dilemma"
"Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon delivers her concession speech at the Working Families Party on primary night last year. AP

""Fusion voting,"" whereby minor parties endorse major-party candidates, has long distorted New York politics, so it's great to see a drive to end it.

The simple fact is that minor parties that play the cross-endorsing game routinely decay into mere patronage machines, as did the old Liberal party did. Or, as with the Working Families Party, they're founded to serve special interests while waving an ideological banner.

And, by delivering a small but crucial number of votes, they can wind up becoming ""the tail wagging the dog,"" as Cortland County Democratic Chairman Tim Perfetti puts it: Anti-democratic horse-trading leads elected officials to appease the interests and beliefs of small minorities at the expense of the broader good.

Only seven other states allow fusion voting -- and none abuse the process like New York. Activists who truly mean to offer an alternative should field their own candidates, as the Greens and Libertarians do.

Yes, the WFP charges Gov. Cuomo's thirst for vengeance was behind last week's Democratic State Committee vote in favor of an end to fusion voting. The governor's office denies that motive -- indeed, insists Cuomo is neutral on the question. On the other hand, the gov's certainly been at war with the WFP off and on for years.

But so what? Whatever their reasons, Cuomo and state Chairman Jay Jacobs did the right thing in putting the party on record as favoring reform.

Question is, will they follow through by pushing the Legislature to end this electoral disgrace once and for all ?

The WFP has been fighting back, recruiting endorsements from the likes of Sen. Bernie Sanders. (Then again, lifelong Socialist Party member Sanders is mounting his own takeover of the national Democratic Party, so of course he'd approve.)

More important, the WFP got 26 state senators to sign a letter demanding that Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins preserve fusion voting.

So now it's up to Cuomo: Is he going to stop after giving the WFP a scare -- or push hard for a reform that would make New York politics far healthier?",433,New York Post,Time for New York to end 'fusion voting'
"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A big chunk of the 2020 Democratic field began making Texas an unlikely early-state stop Saturday and pushed back on big tech in front of young, social-media savvy crowds in a city where companies including Google and Apple have big footprints.

Texas is an early primary state, but the real draw of the South by Southwest Festival in Austin for Democrats is face time with the party's ascendant young and liberal wing. The festival has grown from obscure roots into a weeklong juggernaut of tech, politics and entertainment.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts defended her new call to break up tech giants to an audience dotted with employees of some of those very companies. Her appearance began with her interviewer asking tech employees in the crowd to stand up. Warren scanned the room as several people got on the feet.

""There are parts about big tech that are frankly just like railroads of the Teddy Roosevelt era,"" she said. ""What's new is old. When someone gets market dominance, how then they start to destroy competition.""

Warren was also asked whether Sen. Bernie Sanders discouraged from her entering the race. She wouldn't divulge details, calling it a private dinner.

The Minnesota senator kicked off SXSW with promises to reign in tech companies and saying that she has spoken to former President Barack Obama about her own presidential ambitions.

Klobuchar wouldn't go as far as Warren when asked whether Google or Facebook should be broken up.

""I would want to have it investigated. That is how I do things,"" she said. If anti-competitive problems are discovered, Klobuchar said, ""then you come up with a plan to break up or to move something out if there is a piece of it that is anti-competitive.""

Klobuchar criticized the tech industry for not protecting privacy and floated the idea of taxing social media companies when they sell personal data, but she did not give specifics.

The California senator said she's committed to shoring up rural communities, a message the Democratic presidential hopeful shared with voters in some of the most sparsely populated parts of the early voting state of South Carolina.

Harris told a crowd of several hundred gathered in tiny St. George that a national infrastructure of crumbling roads and bridges makes it difficult for people in communities like this one to get to their jobs, which may be miles and miles away.

Harris also said she wants to make changes to rural hospital funding, tweaks that she hopes will lead fewer health care facilities in such areas to close.

In remarks to a small-business summit in North Charleston, Harris pledged to help build back America's image abroad, which she said has been damaged by President Donald Trump.

""What we have seen recently is a president who is conducting foreign affairs by tweet. On Day One, I would make it very clear that I value the importance of diplomacy. I value relationships. And that doesn't take any strength from us, any power from us -- it gives us power,"" she said.

Speaking with reporters, Harris said that she wanted more information about the investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to be made available to the public.

Sanders told a packed house in Des Moines that as president his power to reform industries and institutions would be limited, but he'd still fulfill his campaign promises with their support.

The Vermont senator said ""no president, not the best-intentioned in the world, can take on those extraordinarily powerful forces."" He went on to say: ""But we have something they don't have -- we have the people.""

The crowd packed into the Animal Learning Center on the Iowa State Fairgrounds roared their approval of Sanders, who is making another run for the Democratic nomination. Many were decked out in his 2016 campaign gear or waved ""IA loves Bernie"" signs.

About 50 volunteers showed up to support Sanders at the final stop of his three-day swing through the state, part of an Iowa volunteer force that he said already totals 7,000.

""We need you to add to that number,"" he said, to roars from the crowd.

Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said during his first trip to Iowa as a candidate that it would be ""crazy"" to drive out everyone who's in the U.S. illegally.

Hickenlooper launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination this week and is positioning himself as a uniter who can get things done. On immigration, Hickenlooper said both sides need to sit down and that hardliners must accept some realities.

""To think we're ever in this country, that was founded and defined by immigrants, to expel 10 million to 11 million people is crazy,"" Hickenlooper said.

O'Rourke swung by the trendy and techie SXSW, too, but still didn't announce whether he will embark on a White House run.

"TORONTO - There's no money, no sex and nothing illegal happened. This is what passes for a scandal in Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been engulfed in allegations involving possible collusion with Russia and secret payments to buy the silence of a porn star. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a controversy that seems trivial by comparison, but it could topple him in elections later this year.

Two high-profile women ministers in Trudeau's Cabinet, including Canada's first indigenous justice minister, resigned in protest, and his top aide and best friend quit too.

The former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and senior members of his government pressured her in a case involving a major Canadian engineering company accused of corruption related to its business dealings in Libya. Trudeau reportedly leaned on the attorney general to instruct prosecutors to reach the equivalent of plea deal, which would avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, because he felt that jobs were at stake.

""People south of the border would be astonished to think that this is the type of scandal that they have in Canada,"" said Eddie Goldenberg, a former adviser to former Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Many countries would be jealous of a scandal that went no further than a prime minster asking another minister to do something she is legally entitled to do, Goldenberg said.

""I just don't really see it as a scandal,"" he said. ""There is a political correctness here. Nobody wants to go after an indigenous woman minister. It's become politically incorrect to question the former minister.""

Trudeau has said he asked Wilson-Raybould to revisit her decision not to instruct prosecutors and said she agreed to consider that. He denied applying any inappropriate pressure, saying he and his officials were only pointing out that prosecution could endanger thousands of jobs.

SNC-Lavalin has pleaded not guilty to fraud and corruption charges related to allegations it paid about $35 million (CA$47 million) in bribes to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011.

""It's a pseudo-scandal. It's crap. What the hell?

Wilson-Raybould has said herself that the pressure from Trudeau and others was not illegal and that she was not explicitly instructed to do a remediation agreement.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary and best friend who resigned, said nothing inappropriate was alleged until after Wilson-Raybould left the Cabinet, suggesting she felt sour grapes about losing her dream job.

Opposition Conservative Andrew Scheer leader has demanded that Trudeau resign, saying he tried to interfere in a criminal prosecution. Canadian media have covered the story as intensely as American networks have covered Trump, noted Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto.

""Trudeau would not be able to get away with what Trump does because the political cultures and the state of political polarization of the two countries are still quite different,"" Wiseman said.

The differences among Canadian media outlets, for example, are ""relatively narrow compared to the chasms between Fox and MSNBC or CNN. The American media are reporting on two different worlds. The Canadian media are reporting on the same Wilson-Raybould-Trudeau story,"" Wiseman added.

Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trudeau has framed himself differently than Trump. Trump said sympathetic things about Russia during the campaign and was elected despite that and other controversies, giving him ""the sense that he can do anything and his base will still follow him.""

Trudeau, meanwhile, promised transparency while describing himself as a feminist who was also determined to right the wrongs against Canada's indigenous people. Women make up half of his cabinet.

""He depicted himself as a feminist, as someone who believes in indigenous reconciliation, and then you have two of his top female Cabinet ministers resign, and they are depicting him in a very different light,"" Beland said.

"Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb announces his intention to step down in one month.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the nation's most ubiquitous regulatory agency. It oversees a vast array of medical and food products that account for 25 cents of every consumer dollar, with a value of over a trillion dollars annually.

And the agency has problems.

It's too risk-averse, bureaucratically top-heavy, and dependent on policymaking that constitutes the ""dark matter"" of government - announcements, guidance documents, warning letters, speeches and so on, instead of formal rulemaking.

OPIOID CRISIS -- SINCE WHEN DOES THE GOVERNMENT WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS?

With the just-announced resignation of FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the White House and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will begin a search to replace him. We need someone who will deregulate aggressively in order to stimulate innovation, get more products on the market, and put downward pressure on drug prices.

The FDA is a favorite target of critics, who variously accuse regulators of excessive risk-aversion and delay of approvals, or of too cozy a relationship with the drug industry. Former FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young once characterized his agency as ""a slow-moving target that bleeds profusely when hit.""

Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, chided the agency during a hearing, ""The health and safety of the public must be the FDA's first and only concern."" He is right, but particularly when governmental pre-marketing approval of a product is required, greater safety is not synonymous with more stringent regulation.

In fact, net benefit to patients often suffers because of a regulatory anomaly: the asymmetry of outcomes from the two types of mistakes that regulators can make.

A regulator can commit an error by permitting something bad to happen (approving a harmful product like a drug with delayed side effects), or by preventing something good from becoming available (not approving a beneficial product such as the meningitis B vaccine that the FDA delayed for years). Both outcomes are bad for the public, but the consequences for the regulator are very different.

The first kind of error is highly visible, causing the regulators to be attacked by the media and patient groups, and to be investigated by Congress. But the second kind of error - keeping a potentially important product out of consumers' hands - is usually a non-event, eliciting little attention, let alone outrage.

If we are to balance drug safety, innovation in research and development, and the availability and price of new medicines, we must find a way to make regulators accountable for costly errors of all kinds.

Former FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt aptly summarized the regulator's conundrum: ""In all our FDA history, we are unable to find a single instance where a Congressional committee investigated the failure of FDA to approve a new drug. But the times when hearings have been held to criticize our approval of a new drug have been so frequent that we have not been able to count them. The message to FDA staff could not be clearer.""

As a result, regulators make decisions defensively, so they tend to delay or reject new products of all sorts, from fat substitutes to vaccines and painkillers. That's bad for public health and for consumers' freedom to choose.

Congressional oversight is supposed to provide a check on regulators' performance, but rarely does it focus on their unnecessarily delaying product approvals. A premature or mistaken approval makes for more exciting hearings, with injured patients and their families paraded before the cameras.

If we are to balance drug safety, innovation in research and development, and the availability and price of new medicines, we must find a way to make regulators accountable for costly errors of all kinds.

The implicit contract between society and regulators demands greater accountability: We grant civil servants lifetime tenure, shielding them from the pressures of partisan politics and the threat of retaliation (which prevents the firing of even the most incompetent and ineffective employees), and in return, they are supposed to make decisions based solely on the public interest.

Alas, that is not always the case.

While he did a lot of chest-thumping on easier issues, Dr. Gottlieb shied away from or stumbled over many tough ones. The FDA's current dysfunctional regulation of animals made with modern genetic engineering (see this and this), the war on e-cigarettes, and the permissiveness toward illegal claims by the organic food industry are good examples.

Several characteristics will be essential in Gottlieb's replacement.

Superior management skills and experience. The agency's scope is so sweeping - encompassing cardiac pacemakers, x-ray machines, condoms, home pregnancy-testing kits, drugs, vaccines, genetically engineered animals, artificial sweeteners and fat substitutes - that a single person cannot be expected to master the body of science, medicine, pharmacology and engineering (to say nothing of the law and ""regulatory science"") involved. One must assume that the FDA's own professional staff can frame the issues and options; the function of the agency head, then, should be primarily to manage the far-flung empire and to make the final decision on difficult policy questions.

Unassailable integrity and honesty. The commissioner's decision-making must meld law, science, medicine and regulatory precedents, in a way that maximizes the public interest. The incumbent needs to earn the respect of those who have a stake in the FDA's policies and decisions - patient groups, individual consumers, drug companies - by means of candor and consistency.

Committed to regulatory reform. The FDA needs both to streamline existing regulatory procedures and requirements, and to work with Congress on new approaches that offer non-governmental alternatives to some of the agency's functions. The latter could include enhanced use of expert advisory committees, contracting out product reviews, reciprocity of approvals with certain foreign counterparts, and the creation of a mechanism like Underwriters Laboratories' certification of thousands of categories of products. In addition, FDA's senior and mid-level managers must be made more accountable for their decisions - especially those that delay the availability of new drugs, vaccines and medical devices to patients in need of them.

Distanced from politics. The FDA commissioner's job should not be awarded as a political plum, as are certain cabinet posts and ambassadorships. Politics should be banished insofar as that is possible, with the commissioner taking the heat for unpopular decisions.

"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has, thanks to the weak leadership of the Democratic Party, brought antisemitism into the mainstream of American politics.

She did it thanks to assistance from the so-called ""Justice Democrats,"" who argued that rebuking her for using age-old anti-Jewish canards would mean silencing criticism of Israel.

It was a curious argument, since Omar had not criticized any particular Israeli policy or action. Her attack -- for which she refuses to apologize -- was against Americans who support Israel.

To protect her, Omar's defenders linked antisemitism to anti-Israel criticism in a way critics of Israel have resisted for decades. Their habitual complaint had been that Israel's defenders try to undermine legitimate criticism of the Jewish state by labeling such criticism as antisemitic -- though, as Alan Dershowitz has pointed out in The Case Against Israel's Enemies, it is almost impossible to find any examples of ""mainstream supporters of Israel"" who equate ""mere criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.""

Now, the Democrats have officially adopted the position that antisemitism must be tolerated if it might be construed as an effort to criticize Israel.

This has long been the tacit position of many left-wing critics of Israel, as they have wished away the official anti-Jewish propaganda of the Palestinian Authority and other Arab regimes. Now it is party dogma, clothed in condescension as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tells Americans that Omar ""doesn't understand"" the meaning of the words she uses.

Omar understood her words very well, and they were applauded enthusiastically by the audience in a Washington, DC, restaurant owned by an anti-Israel activist. She complained that accusations of antisemitism meant that ""nobody ever gets to have a proper debate of what is happening in Palestine"" -- and then made her now-infamous statement about ""allegiance to a foreign country.""

That is a debate about Jews, not Israel -- and Omar got it. Thanks to Democrats, Antisemitism is protected by anti-Israel criticism.",437,Breitbart,Pollak: Democrats Showed Criticism of Israel Can Be a Shield for Antisemitism | Breitbart
"Ebba Busch Thor, leader of the Swedish Christian Democrats (KD), has slammed the mass migration policies of the Swedish government, saying they have made women less secure.

The conservative leader slammed the left-wing establishment, saying it had largely failed on feminist issues despite supporting a supposed feminist-oriented policy in an op-ed for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.

""Above all, the issue of women's insecurity must be addressed -- and it is acute,"" she wrote.

""The fear is largely due to harassment from wandering groups of young men, often new arrivals from parts of the world where women are not expected to move freely.""

Busch Thor added that the municipality youth service had even advised young girls not to go out by themselves, not just at night but also during the day.

""This means that the woman's human dignity is subordinated to the man's. She will stay home or be escorted because he cannot handle his impulses. I do not want that, can not and will not accept it. Nor will I be silent about it,"" she added.

She also slammed what she referred to as ""feminists on television sofas,"" saying they were too busy ""discussing gender stereotyped Lego characters or men's art in the Stockholm subway"" while ""a long series of real-life questions await solutions.""

""This is my challenge to the country's gender equality debates: do you want to help me build a new kind of feminism, or do you want to continue to be part of the problem?"" she added.

The Christian Democrats have, next to the populist Sweden Democrats (SD), consistently been some of the most conservative voices in Swedish politics in recent years and were recently supportive of moving the country's Israeli embassy to Jerusalem.

The party's voters have also been open to the idea of working with the SD, with a poll last November showing that 83 percent of KD voters favoured talks to share power with the anti-mass migration populists.",438,Breitbart,Swedish Conservative: Mass Migration Adds to Women's Insecurity

Several 2020 presidential candidates of all political stripes appeared at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, on Saturday. But it was U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- who at 29 years old is ineligible to seek the White House -- who drew the largest crowd.

The New York Democrat attracted more interest than a bill that included U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Starbucks CEO and potential candidate Howard Schultz, and former Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, event organizers told KRIS-TV of Corpus Christi.

Other Democratic candidates slated to speak Sunday included Julian Castro, the former Cabinet secretary in the Obama administration and former San Antonio mayor, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.

Ocasio-Cortez's audience packed a ballroom at the nine-day music and media festival, with some being turned away, according to the station.

During an interview with Briahna Gray, senior politics editor for the Intercept, the freshman congresswoman chastised political moderates, touched on racism, capitalism, class and the wealth gap and took a question from Bill Nye - known as Bill Nye the Science Guy.

Later Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez reacted to a tweet that said Starbucks boss Schultz was greeted with silence upon his criticism of the Green New Deal while at SXSW.

""Ah yes, because we've all drawn upon the rich inspiration of American leaders who've inspired a nation in crisis by saying, ""No, You Can't,"" she tweeted.

Ocasio-Cortez has become one of the most recognizable political figures in Congress, in part because of her use of social media and her outspoken personality. They have also made her the subject of criticism from both Republicans and Democrats.

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, one of her supporters, recently said in an interview that the Constitution's age requirement to become president - 35 years old - should be amended so Ocasio-Cortez can launch a White House bid.

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed political moderates at the South by Southwest Conference & Festivals in Austin, Texas, calling their views ""misplaced"" as she defended her progressive politics in a room full of supporters.

""Moderate is not a stance. It's just an attitude towards life of, like, 'meh,'"" the New York Democrat said Saturday during an interview with Briahna Gray, senior politics editor for the Intercept. ""We've become so cynical, that we view 'meh,' or 'eh' -- we view cynicism as an intellectually superior attitude, and we view ambition as youthful naivete when ... the greatest things we have ever accomplished as a society have been ambitious acts of visions, and the 'meh' is just worshipped now, for what?""

The self-declared Democratic socialist also criticized the treatment of minorities throughout American history, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, which she claimed was racist, to Ronald Reagan's policies, which she said ""pitted"" white working class people against minorities in order ""to screw over all working-class Americans,"" particularly African-Americans and Hispanics.

""And it's this whole tragedy of the commons type of thinking where it's like because ... this one specific group of people, that you are already kind of subconsciously primed to resent, you give them a different reason that's not explicit racism but still rooted in a racist caricature,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""It gives people a logical reason, a 'logical' reason to say, 'Oh yeah, no, toss out the whole social safety net.'""

CAPITOL GRAPPLES WITH COMPLICATED HISTORY ON RACE

Other topics Ocasio-Cortez discussed included the Green New Deal and capitalism, which she said could not be redeemed because it puts profit ""above everything else.""

""The most important thing is the concentration of capital, and it means that we prioritize profit and the accumulation of money above all else, and we seek it at any human and environmental cost... But when we talk about ideas like democratic socialism, it means putting democracy and society first, instead of capital first; it doesn't mean that the actual concept of capitalistic society should be abolished,"" she said.

""I'm a white guy,"" Nye said. ""I think the problem on both sides is fear. People of my ancestry are afraid to pay for everything as immigrants come into this country.

That's what's going on with many conservatives especially when it comes to climate change. People are afraid of what happens when we try to make these big changes.""

""One of the keys to dismantling fear is dismantling a zero-sum mentality,"" Ocasio-Cortez replied. ""It means the rejection outright of the logic that says someone else's gain necessitates my loss and that my gain must necessitate someone's loss. We can give without a take. We're viewing progress as a loss instead of as an investment. When we choose to invest in our system, we are choosing to create wealth.

"Pick up a newspaper or watch the news about what Democrats are up to and you're certain to ask yourself the same question dominating American politics: Are they going too far?

Did Democrats overreach when they invited convicted liar and turncoat scammer Michael Cohen to tell Congress President Trump is a bad guy?

Are they on a ridiculous fishing expedition when they summon 81 people, including three of the president's children, to testify to a congressional panel whose chairman says he's certain Trump committed crimes, no matter what special counsel Robert Mueller says?

Have they lost their minds with plans for a single-payer health system, the Green New Deal, unrestricted abortion, open borders and endless free stuff?

Then there is the fiasco involving Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose habit of making anti-Semitic remarks somehow became a referendum on Islamophobia. In failing to call her out and instead treating her like a victim of Republican hate, did Democrats condone her anti-Semitism?

Certainly Jewish voters might think so. Among Dems' most loyal constituencies, with about 75 percent of their votes usually going to the party's presidential nominee, Jews were told to suck it up and take one for the team.

Stripped of details, all these events display the conviction among Democrats that Trump's election and conduct give them license to eliminate all restrictions on their own behavior. The pattern reveals that Trump Derangement Syndrome has gone from being a temporary madness to a permanent political strategy. Anything goes if there is some way to blame Trump.

He hit me first! You hear that on playgrounds -- and now in the halls of Congress.

Although Dems are deadly serious about using the excuse to ¬≠motivate their base from now until the 2020 elections, most voters will focus on other things as well, including candidates' plans for the future. So do

Trump's opponents have realistic plans, or have they simply gone off the deep end in their zeal to destroy him?

My answer is no, they have no real plans, and yes, absolutely yes, they are way out of bounds in their fanatical reactions to Trump. They assume that a majority of the public hates him as much as they do, and that ruthless, endless assaults on him, his children and business will yield political gold.

My doubts about the strategy are not meant to suggest that Trump should be exempt from criticism and disagreement. It is merely to recognize the unprecedented nature of the attacks and the far-out-of-the-mainstream policies opponents are rashly adopting.

Consider the efforts by the previous administration to deny Trump the presidency by weaponizing law enforcement and ¬≠intelligence, and the sense of entitlement demonstrated by leaders of the FBI and Department of Justice who abused their powers for partisan purposes. Although the full extent of those efforts remains hidden, we know more than enough to conclude that there is a deep state and it tried to tip the election to Hillary Clinton.

When that failed, it tried to bring down the president. Those facts need to count for something.

As for policies, Dems have become so routinely radical that Bernie Sanders is forced to play catch-up. Two years ago, he was a socialist dreamer. Now he looks almost reasonable compared to the new crop of far-lefties pushing ""aspirational"" overhauls of the ¬≠nation.

Of course, my belief that Dems are going too far could be the minority view. Polls suggest the nation is split almost exactly in half over Trump, leaving fewer and fewer swing voters up for grabs.

In fact, a case can be made that Dems were rewarded in the midterm elections for their overreach when voters gave them the House, knowing they would use it to try to impeach the president. And that's exactly the plan that is unfolding, thanks to new House committee chairmen such as Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff.

Seen that way, Speaker Nancy Pelosi succeeded brilliantly in handling the Omar mess. Although her initial intent was to single out anti-Semitism, without naming Omar, Pelosi didn't have the votes to do even that.

So she followed the sheep to safety and denounced all forms of bigotry, a farce larded by commentary blaming Trump.

As the far-left Working Families Party put it in a fundraising e-mail titled ""Why We Stand with Rep. ¬≠Ilhan Omar,"" Trump and the GOP are the villains because they targeted ""a young, progressive, trailblazing woman of color.""

Pelosi also made cringe-inducing pandering and patronizing statements to defend Omar, saying the Somali refugee -- in America for more than 20 years -- ""has a different experience in the use of words.""

Indeed, by turning Omar into a victim, House Dems are in sync with their media handmaidens. The overt bias against Trump and the trashing of fairness standards -- none of that is the fault of journalists.

Trump made them do it. Just ask Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times.

""I think that he's challenged our language. He will have changed journalism, he really will have,"" Baquet said during the last presidential campaign.

The context was helping reporters say directly that Trump wasn't being honest. Thus was born the decision to call the president a liar, a word the Gray Lady apparently reserves for the president.

That was also the start of supposedly straight news articles delivering scathingly negative opinions of Trump. Among the daily deluge, two recent examples stick out: One faulted Mexico for working with Trump on the border crisis, with the headline saying the government there was ""Collaborating Quietly"" and wanted to ""Placate Trump.""

The other equated Trump with Kim Jong-un, the headline saying their summit failed because of ""Big Threats, Big Egos, Bad Bets.""

So the Times takes the side of foreign parties as long as they oppose Trump. If they support Trump, they are ""collaborating,"" thus seemingly equating Mexico's actions with those of Vichy France in World War II.

In another era, readers would punish such outrageous conduct. Now, like the Democrats they serve, the media are rewarded

for it.

Readers, revenue and the stock price of the Times have soared thanks to what an executive called the ""Trump bump.""

Calling it the ""anti-Trump bump"" would have been more honest.

"It's more likely history will judge President Trump for accomplishments in office than for character flaws. AP

Progressives claim President Trump marks a new low in American political and presidential history, personifying a singularly odious message.

But if we examine the present pantheon of progressive icons, and strip away their reliance on liberal-media protection and transfer them instead into the present age of tabloid promiscuity and cyber omnipresence, would we now have a very different view of their presidencies?

The progressive Woodrow Wilson administration likely would never have completed its two elected terms had it operated on media protocols common just a half-century later.

For nearly a year during the failing health and death of First Lady Ellen Axson Wilson, the president fell into a state of debilitating depression, carefully hidden from the press. Much later, during the last 17 months of Wilson's presidency, he was more or less unable to fulfill his duties due to a series of strokes that left him partially paralyzed and visually impaired. Those realities were carefully hidden from the public by the efforts of his second wife, Edith Bolling Wilson, and physician Dr. Cary Grayson.

In the present case, we know that Trump is neither comatose nor is Melania running the country.

The country never learned the full extent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's paralysis. Much less did it know of FDR's past and ongoing affairs -- the mechanics of which were sometimes carried out in the White House and with the skillful aid of his own daughter Anna. By fall 1944, Roosevelt, seeking a fourth term, was suffering from a series of life-threatening conditions. Worrying that the public would not vote yet again for a terminally ill president, sympathetic journalists and military physicians covered up Roosevelt's illnesses -- on the theory that FDR would survive long enough to get elected to a fourth term and ensure a continued Democratic administration.

Clearly, in our age of the internet and social media and an inquisitorial media, Ivanka Trump could not have been helping her father conduct a stealth affair in the White House while conspiring to hide his likely terminal illness from the public.

John F. Kennedy, by contemporary standards, was a serial sexual harasser, if not a likely assaulter. While physically in the White House he carried on sexual trysts with subordinates and others without security clearances, mostly with the full knowledge of the complacent White House press corps. One former JFK intern, Mimi Alford, later wrote a memoir describing losing her virginity at 19 years of age to the president in the White House presidential bed. On his direction and in his audience, she was leveraged into performing oral intercourse in the White House swimming pool on his aide David Powers, who routinely set up the president's extramarital trysts.

For all his alleged goatishness, Trump is currently not orchestrating group sexual encounters in the White House basement.

Lyndon Johnson was not just a serial adulterer and often corrupt, but displayed a level of crudity that would now be seen as clinical, from conducting business while defecating on the toilet to exposing his genitals to staff -- apparently as some sort of Freudian proof of his own, and by extension, his nation's, manhood. In a debate answer to a sneer from Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump seems to have referenced obliquely his private parts (""I guarantee you there's no problem"") but never to our knowledge has he displayed them to staffers.

There is no reason to review the escapades of an impeached Bill Clinton. Despite the efforts of a sympathetic media, many of his transgressions were in part aired to the public. They ran the full gamut of a classical sexist and misogynist, from likely sexually assaulting chance acquaintances to attempting to defame and ruin the reputations of women deemed liable to disclose past liaisons.

What differentiates Trump's womanizing from that of prior presidents, like Clinton's, is that his escapades were prior to, not during, his presidential service.

A study published by the liberal Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy found that coverage of the Trump presidency in its first hundred days was 80 percent negative, as evidenced in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, in addition to CNN, CBS, Fox News and CNBC parent NBC, as well as European news outlets the Financial Times, BBC and ARD in Germany. The same researchers found that coverage of Trump was about twice as negative as had been true of reporting on Barack Obama.

How did the media and progressive critics reconcile a supposedly historically unhinged and dangerous president with a largely successful agenda that by mid-2018 was polling positive? And how exactly had such a flawed character as Trump made impressive Cabinet appointments and restored economic vibrancy at home and deterrence abroad?

Stranger still, Trump earned vitriol often for voicing positions shared by past progressive presidents and presidential candidates: skepticism over NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreements, slapping tariffs on Chinese companies for dumping, congratulating Vladimir Putin and General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt for ""election"" victories and Xi Jinping on his ""extraordinary elevation,"" or issuing expansive executive orders as Obama had. Finally, the anti-Trump progressives and Democrats, especially those in the media, did not fully appreciate that the more they voiced loudly their antipathy to Trump, and did so in escalating fashion, the more Trump was able to manipulate them as proof of how unhinged and excitable the alternative to himself was.

The small number of Never Trump conservatives who equally despised Trump, also felt his crudity was unlike any other president's. But unlike progressives, they faced an additional dilemma: The presidential messenger was often successfully enacting an agenda that they not only had in the past supported, but also at least privately admitted was empowered by Trump himself. Nonetheless, their complaint was that Republicans stood for character. And Trump lacked it.

But, on matters of character, did Trump's tawdry trysts with women, often a decade before his presidency, mean that he lacked character and thus stained the conservative cause, in a way that the often promiscuous Roosevelt, Kennedy and Clinton had not rendered their own liberal accomplishments null and void? When reports surfaced that George H.W. Bush, in his 80s and 90s, had serially groped a few women and embarrassed them with nasty jokes, did conservatives recalibrate his administration's record?

Dwight D. Eisenhower was a successful president in the manner that he had been an effective supreme allied commander. Yet under current Trump-era workplace protocols, Ike would likely never have been nominated, given his poorly hidden relationship with his divorced chauffeur Kay Summersby and his implausible outright denials of the affair while he held the title of supreme commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe.

Our current media and political climate would have judged the careful Eisenhower reckless, or indeed callously immoral, in his downtime with the loquacious Summersby while battle raged just miles away from his headquarters.

Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter were both emblematic of flyover-state, rock-solid values. They stayed married. They did not cash in while in their offices. They largely told the truth. Their administrations were mostly free of scandal. Their speech was rarely ad hominem. America certainly benefitted from their personal probity. They were, in other words, role models and ethical public servants.

But both Ford and Carter proved largely ineffective presidents. In terms of economic stagnation between 1974 and 1981, millions of lives were perhaps worse off for their tenures. Few can point to any lasting substantial achievements, apart from airline deregulation and the Arab-Israeli Camp David Accords in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. Ford's sad ""Whip Inflation Now"" button campaign and Carter's serial disasters (stagflation, the appeasement of Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran, the rudderless foreign policy) are not arguments that good character does not matter, only that it is not necessarily always a guarantee of good governance.

In some sense, Donald Trump was replaying the role of the unpopular tenure of loudmouth Democrat Harry Truman, the president from 1945 to 1953.

""Give 'em Hell"" Harry came into office following the death of Franklin Roosevelt. He miraculously won the 1948 election against all expert opinion and polls.

Truman left office in January 1953 widely hated. Indeed, his final approval ratings (32 percent) were the lowest of any departing president except for those of Richard Nixon.

The outsider Truman had always been immersed in scandal, owing to his deep ties to the corrupt Kansas City political machine.

When the novice Vice President Truman took office after Roosevelt's death in April 1945, he knew little about the grand strategy of World War II -- and nothing about the ongoing atomic-bomb project.

For the next seven-plus years, Truman shocked -- and successfully led -- the country.

Over the objections of many in his Cabinet, Truman ignored critics and ordered the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan to end the war. Against the advice of most of the State Department, he recognized the new state of Israel.

He offended Roosevelt holdovers by breaking with wartime ally the Soviet Union and chartering the foundations of Cold War communist containment. Many in the Pentagon opposed his racial integration of the armed forces. National-security advisors counseled against sending troops to save South Korea.

Liberals opposed fellow Democrat Truman's creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Truman was widely loathed for firing controversial five-star general and American hero Douglas MacArthur.

There were often widespread calls in the press for Truman to resign. Impeachment was often mentioned. Truman, in short, did things other presidents had not dared to do.

Truman occasionally swore. He had nightly drinks. He played poker with cronies. And he shocked aides and the public with his vulgarity and crass attacks on political enemies.

Truman cheaply compared 1948 presidential opponent Thomas Dewey to Hitler and attacked him as a supposed pawn of bigots and war profiteers.

Truman hyperbolically claimed a Republican victory in 1948 would threaten America's very liberty.

In the pre-Twitter age, Truman could never keep his mouth shut: ""My choice early in life was either to be a piano player in a whorehouse or a politician. And to tell the truth, there's hardly any difference.""

When a reviewer for The Washington Post trashed Truman's daughter's concert performance, Truman threatened him with physical violence.

""It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful,"" Truman wrote in a letter to critic Paul Hume.

""Someday I hope to meet you. When that happens, you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes and perhaps a supporter below!""

Such outbursts were Trumpian to the core.

It took a half-century for historians to concede that the mercurial and often adolescent Truman had solid accomplishments, especially in foreign affairs -- in part because Truman conveyed a sense that he did not much care for staying in Washington, a city in which he was not invested, did not like and would quickly leave at the end of his tenure.

Even Truman's crassness eventually was appreciated as integral to his image of a ""plain speaking"" and ""the Buck Stops Here"" decisive leader.

Had Truman access to Twitter, he could have self-destructed in a flurry of ad-hominem electronic outbursts. Yet Truman proved largely successful because of what he did, and in spite of what he said.

Donald J. Trump's presidency is too brief to yet be judged absolutely. His personal foibles are too embedded within current political and media hatred to be assessed dispassionately.

Too many assessments too quickly have been made about Trump, without much historical context and usually with too much passion.

Neither is it yet clear that Trump is a bad man or a good president, or vice versa, or neither or both.

But if the past is sometimes a guide to the present, Trump in theory certainly could become a more effective president than would have been his likely more circumspect Republican primary rivals, while perhaps demonstrating that he is far more uncouth.

The paradox again raises the question: When any one man can change the lives of 330 million, what exactly is presidential morality after all -- private and personal sins, or the transgressions that affect millions of lives for the worse?",446,New York Post,Democratic presidents behaved a lot worse than Trump in the White
"The HBO star had an apparent change of mind after House Democrats struggled to condemn Omar in a resolution that was broadened to include multiple forms of hate. (HBO)

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher reversed course over allegations of anti-Semitism against Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, after previously defending her.

Omar has been accused of anti-Semitism because of controversial tweets suggesting that people who are pro-Israel are bought by groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).

""First of all, I'm a free speech person. I believe you're allowed to criticize Israel without being an anti-Semite,"" Maher said Friday night. ""Having said that, I've read some of her other tweets... She might be. I don't know what her thoughts are on this.""

Last month, Maher said he didn't know why Omar's tweets were being viewed as anti-Semitic.

""I probably don't agree with her a lot about what she feels about Israel and Palestine, but I don't know why this has to be seen as anti-Semitic,"" Maher said at the time. ""Now, she may be anti-Semitic, but if I criticize Saudi Arabia, that doesn't mean I'm Islamophobe.""

""It became an issue for the Democrats of 'we can't censure this person because it's a woman and a person of color' and that I think is identity politics, is it not?"" Maher said Friday night.

Later, Maher wondered if Democrats could lose the Jewish vote after President Donald Trump attacked them as the ""anti-Israel"" and ""anti-Jewish"" party.

Maher also expressed hope that Omar would appear on his show to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"Here's a prediction: Howard Schultz is due for some Strange New Respect. That's the jokey term applied to someone who bends the Main Stream Media's way -- and that's exactly what Schultz is now doing.

The Starbucks mogul has, of course, been flirting with national politics for years, publishing various self-back-patting books about himself, touting woke causes, endorsing Hillary Clinton, and taking occasional swings at Donald Trump (who, of course, has been happy to hit back).

As far as the Main Stream Media was concerned, Schultz's presence on the national stage was all fine and good; after all, everyone needs a hobby, and if Schultz's hobby is corporate liberalism, okay. Why, even if he wanted maybe to seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, well, that was all right, because nobody thought he had a chance to slip past the likes of Democratic warriors such as Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, or Cory Booker.

Yet Schultz took a bad tumble in late January, when he announced that he was really thinking about running for president, not as a Democrat, but as an independent. And to underscore his seriousness, he announced that he had hired two well-known political operatives, one from each party. That duo was Steve Schmidt, a Republican (strictly speaking, an ex-Republican, as in 2018, he had announced he was quitting the Trumpified GOP, which he deemed to be ""corrupt"" and ""immoral""), and Bill Burton, a Democratic veteran of the Obama White House.

Old-timers recalled that this was the sort of bipartisan pairing used by another independent billionaire, Ross Perot, in 1992. Back then, Perot hired Ed Rollins, a Republican, and Hamilton Jordan, a Democrat, to be the co-managers of his campaign. And of course, Perot did pretty well by indie standards: He won 19 percent of the vote. That was indeed a lot, and since Perot spent most of the campaign attacking the Republican incumbent, George H.W. Bush -- while sparing the Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton -- he did vastly more damage to Bush. So no wonder Clinton won, albeit with a mere 43 percent of the popular vote.

So we can see: If an independent candidate runs, and spends enough money, he can have a major effect. And so it matters, a lot, how that independent tilts his campaign: Who is his target? Who does he aim to hurt?

In the case of Schultz back in January, the MSM, nudged along by associated Democrats, did a quick calculation and figured that, unlike in '92, a Schultz independent candidacy in '20 would hurt the Democratic challenger far more than the Republican incumbent. That is, since Schultz was a Hillary Clinton-type Democrat, he'd most likely draw from Hillary-type voters. And it's those Hillaryish voters whom the Democrats would need to win next year.

So the bat-signal went out: Stop Schultz. And the Democratic faithful responded: Schultz was deluged by a typhoon of negative coverage; phrases like ""egotistical billionaire [bleep] hole,"" and ""total idiot,"" resounded through the headlines. And from Schultz's point of view, perhaps the most ominous header of all: ""Boycott Starbucks.""

Within a few days, Schultz had buckled. He sought to reassure Democrats that he would not be a spoiler; that is, he would not run if it would help Trump win a second term.

Yet at the same time, it was obvious that he had things to say, and the passion -- or, if one prefers, the ego -- to want to keep saying them. He was, after all, a Hillary Democrat, not an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democrat, and he made that plain.

At which point, back on January 30, this author suggested that there was a way for Schultz to have his coffeecake and eat it, too. That is, Schultz could run for president, enjoying the experience (and why not? he has everything else), and yet not spoil the election for the Democrats.

You see, as an independent, Schultz would have the option of choosing the states in which he wanted to get on the presidential ballot. As such, if he wished, he could avoid seeking ballot access in swing states -- such as Colorado, North Carolina, and Ohio -- where even a few Schultz votes could make the difference, throwing the state's electoral votes to Trump. Instead, he could file to be on the ballot only in deep-red states -- such as, say, Alabama, North Dakota, and West Virginia -- and he could campaign in those places to his heart's content. (We might recall that this is the way that Never Trumper Evan McMullin campaigned in his indie bid in 2016; he focused on his home state of Utah, hoping to yank the Beehive State's six electoral votes out of the Trump column.)

Indeed, with such a targeted campaign, and with enough money, Schultz could actually be an asset to the Democrats. That is, he might be able to peel away enough Republican votes in a state or two, thereby giving the electoral votes to the Democratic candidate. If so, he would have gained that Strange New Respect. Why, he could even expect that every grateful Democrat would order more frappuccinos.

With this in mind, it was intriguing to see an article in The Hill on March 7, headlined, ""Schultz recruiting GOP insiders ahead of possible 2020 bid."" The new hires are Brendon Del Toro, Matt Lo Parco, and Greg Strimple, all of whom have worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official campaign arm of the House Republicans. Which is to say, the three are, or at least were, real Republicans.

And if this trio is now going to work for Schultz, and his top Republican aide, Schmidt -- whose Never Trump credentials have always in good standing -- then it's easy to see that if Mr. Starbucks runs they will, in fact, be targeting Republican voters. After all, if you were targeting Democratic voters, you wouldn't be hiring GOP operatives.

So thus we see the outlines of a plausible plan for 2020: Schultz, aided by his Republican hirelings, goes after Republican votes, seeking to siphon them away from Trump. That's not a plan for winning the White House, it's a plan for being a Democratic hero.

In fact, just on March 8, Schultz tweeted, ""America's free-enterprise system has provided more opportunity and created more prosperity than any other economic model in the history of the world.""

That's exactly the sort of tweet you send out if you're on the hunt for Republican votes.",448,Breitbart,Pinkerton: Howard Schultz Re-Ups 'Never Trump' | Breitbart
"Rep. Ilhan Omar under fire for her comments yet again; reaction and analysis from our power panel on 'Fox News @ Night.'

Rep. Ilhan Omar's attempt to shame a news outlet for misquoting her blistering attack on former President Barack Obama backfired after she released audio of the interview that only served to confirm her remarks.

The Minnesota Democrat, who's faced controversy over comments perceived as anti-Semitic, got into hot water yet again after saying Obama's ""hope and change"" message was a ""mirage"" and slammed the administration's drone and border-detention policies.

REP. ILHAN OMAR SLAMS BARACK OBAMA'S MESSAGE OF 'HOPE AND CHANGE' AS A 'MIRAGE'

She told Politico that the Obama administration was responsible for the ""caging of kids"" at the U.S.-Mexico border, the ""droning of countries around the world,"" and that the 44th president ""operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor.""

""We can't be only upset with Trump. ... His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was,"" Omar is quoted as saying in the article. ""And that's not what we should be looking for anymore. We don't want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished. We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile.""

""We can't be only upset with Trump. ... His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was.""

-- Ilhan Omar

Following the article's publication, Omar went on offense on Twitter and accused the outlet's reporter, Tim Alberta, of distorting her words and insisted that she is, in fact, a fan of Obama.

""Exhibit A of how reporters distort words. I'm an Obama fan! I was saying how Trump is different from Obama, and why we should focus on policy not politics. This is why I always tape my interviews,"" she tweeted, attaching an audio recording of the interview.

DEM FROSH TURN TABLES ON ANTI-SEMITISM REBUKE, SHIFT SPOTLIGHT TO ISLAMOPHOBIA AND AIPAC POWER

But the move immediately backfired as the recording actually confirmed the comments she made to the news outlet.

""I think for many of us, we think of ourselves as Democrats. But many of the ways that our Democratic leaders have conducted themselves within the system is not one that we are all proud of,"" she said in the recording.

""You know, I will talk about the family separation or caging of kids and then people will point out that this was wrong - I mean this was Obama. And you know I'll say something about the droning of countries around the world and people will say that was Obama. And all of that is very true. What is happening now is very different. A lot is happening with secrecy. It's happening with the feel-good polished way of talking about it.

""And when we talk about waking people up from complacency, it's to say that we can't be only upset with Trump because he's not a politician who sells us his policies in the most perfect way. His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was,"" she continued.

""And that's not what we should be looking for anymore. We don't want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished. We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile, so that we can understand the kind of negative impact, or positive impact, they will have on us for generations.""

Omar's attempt at shaming a media outlet was called out by the reporter who said the rookie congresswoman tried to bash the media in an effort to avoid the comments she made.

""Exhibit A of how politicians use the media as a straw man to avoid owning what they said. Your tape...supports what I wrote 100%. So does my longer tape. It's beyond dispute,"" tweeted back the reporter at Omar. ""Next time, a phone call from your office before the Twitter ambush would be appreciated.""

The latest controversy came just a day after Omar's comments suggesting that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge ""allegiance"" to the Jewish state - which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old ""dual loyalties"" smear against Jewish politicians - were condemned in a broad anti-bigotry resolution passed by the House.

Omar's anti-Obama comments are likely to further split the Democratic Caucus, which is still reeling from an intra-party fight that erupted in the wake of the anti-bigotry resolution's wording, as Obama remains extremely popular within the party.

"Adult film actress Stormy Daniels speaks to members of the media after a hearing at federal court. AP

Two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, as the editorial head of Fox News online, I reviewed a draft news story that said porn actress Stormy Daniels had confirmed having an affair with Donald Trump a decade earlier. The only problem was ... Stormy hadn't said that.

Daniels and her associates were playing a bizarre cat-and-mouse game with Fox News and other outlets, trying to get their story out without fingerprints and, ultimately, without enough proof to publish.

We and others practiced solid journalism. Now, that's being spun in an effort to prove the opposite.

In 2011, a gossip website called ""The Dirty"" published an anonymous tip alleging that Donald Trump had an affair with Stormy Daniels in 2005 while Melania was pregnant with son Barron.

The next day, Daniels' lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site's operator demanding that the post be removed, which it was.

What's The Dirty? It's a ""user submitted"" site which posts sordid rumors, usually about former girlfriends. It's a dark, often misogynistic place, but it sometimes gets true stories first. (Its top post as I write this publishes a woman's name and photo with the headline ""Crazy Girl Will Fuk Everyone That DM Her."")

On Oct. 18, I got my first look at the Stormy Daniels story written by Fox reporter Diana Falzone, who primarily covered celebrity news for print and video. It wasn't a detailed investigative piece as the media has portrayed this week, but a nine-paragraph story that sorely needed backup.

It included: a two-word confirmation -- ""it's true"" -- from an unnamed Daniels ""spokesperson,"" an anonymous quote from a friend who said she'd dropped off Daniels to meet Trump at a hotel, and quotes from The Dirty owner, who said that he had spoken to Daniels in 2011 and she had confirmed the affair.

It lacked: any mention of payments, a hush money contract or any corroborating evidence beyond the two secondhand accounts.

On top of that, Stormy Daniels herself had publicly denied the whole thing, a denial she would maintain for another year.

The story wasn't close to being publishable, and my decision to hold it was a no-brainer. I didn't do it to help Trump and never said nor implied otherwise. It was such an easy call that I never even informed my direct boss or anyone in management about it.

Still, our editors told Falzone to keep digging until, a week before the election, Stormy and her friends went radio silent.

In the recent national coverage of this incident, based on an article in The New Yorker, no one has questioned why Stormy would try to leak an anti-Trump story exclusively to Fox News, seen by virtually everyone as a pro-Trump outlet. In reality, she was actually talking to a handful of others as well.

The Daily Beast later reported that it had ""protracted talks"" with her and had three sources confirming the affair. She was reportedly in talks with Good Morning America as well.

So why didn't those outlets publish anything either? The best account I've found was written by Jacob Weisberg, Slate's then editor-in-chief, who was also chasing the story. It's a fascinating read and similar to our own experiences.

Prior to the election, he had spoken several times to Daniels and even seen some so-called corroborating evidence, yet still didn't publish a story, for solid reasons. For instance, an unsigned, undated ""contract"" from Daniels' lawyers with pseudonyms throughout is far from proof of the affair.

Why would they offer these bizarre snippets of information and then go silent? Again, Slate's editor gives the best explanation: ""Daniels said she was talking to me and sharing these details because Trump was stalling on finalizing the confidentiality agreement and paying her. Given her experience with Trump, she suspected he would stall her until after the election, and then refuse to sign or pay up.""

After her payment from Trump, Daniels stopped talking, and it took the Wall Street Journal a year to report the story fully on Jan. 12, 2018.

Just days after the WSJ story, Fox's earlier role in not publishing made its way to the press. Perhaps coincidentally it occurred at the same time Diana Falzone was suing the company for gender and disability discrimination. After I had left the company, Falzone was removed from on-camera work, which was essentially a demotion. She sued, claiming that management believed her recent revelation of endometriosis ""detracted from her sex appeal and made her less desirable,"" with no mention of a Stormy Daniels or any other story.

Back then, CNN's Oliver Darcy and Mediaite's Aidan McLaughlin were the only reporters to ask for my side of the story. To this day, they're still the only ones who have.

In December 2018, Jane Mayer of The New Yorker asked me to talk about some of my experiences at Fox News. I spoke at length with her over the months, yet she never inquired about the Stormy Daniels story at all.

A week before publication, I received a few phone calls from a New Yorker fact checker confirming my quotes. Her last one was a surprise, asking me to confirm or deny what they heard from a secondhand source, alleging I had told our reporter it was ""good reporting"" but we shelved it because of Rupert Murdoch's politics. I neither said nor even thought that because neither of those things was true.

I sent Mayer an email with some explanation and an offer to talk, and she responded: ""sorry but I didn't know fact-checkers called, I was hoping to call you first. we just added this to the story today. I'll call in a bit. up to my eyeballs right this moment."" She never did.

I find it odd that she spoke to multiple others about the event, but didn't have a single question for me, the person who unilaterally made the decision. She had time to interview and substantively quote The Dirty's owner, however. In fairness, she did include a link to the year-old Mediaite story and reprinted 10 words from me.

In her 11,635 word piece, she didn't find room to mention the paucity of evidence we had, the conflicting statements nor the other outlets which responded exactly as we did.

The New Yorker piece couldn't have been more successful for them. In a media world where criticizing Fox News is an industry staple, the piece was picked up by almost every major outlet and Jane Mayer was feted throughout journalism.

My non-quote quote and wrong story appeared everywhere from cable news to Jimmy Kimmel to the news outlets that re-wrote the story, including The Washington Post, Guardian, Newsweek, The Hill, Esquire, Vanity Fair and at least 70 others.

I say ""re-wrote"" instead of ""reported"" because not a single reporter reached out to me. None.

I'm an easy guy to find, especially since I'm in the process of launching a startup news site intent on bringing fairness back to journalism. This whole episode is an example of why the media has a credibility crisis.

The ultimate irony is that in its zeal to hang Fox News for journalistic malfeasance, the media tossed journalistic standards in the trash can and gave readers the 100 percent wrong impression of Fox and the Stormy Daniels story.

"Paul Manafort, the clandestine agent of Russia at the heart of the Trump campaign's ""collusion"" scand -- oh, wait.

Have you ever noticed what Paul Manafort's major crime was? After two years of investigation, after the predawn raid in which his wife was held at gunpoint, after months of solitary confinement that have left him a shell of his former self, have you noticed what drew the militant attention of the Obama Justice Department, the FBI, and, ultimately, a special counsel who made him the centerpiece of Russia-gate?

According to the indictment Robert Mueller filed against him, Manafort was an unregistered ""agent of the Government of Ukraine."" He also functioned as an agent of Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine's president from 2010 to 2014, and of two political parties, the Party of Regions and its successor, the Opposition Bloc.

Manafort was not an unregistered agent of Russia. Mueller never alleged that Manafort was a clandestine operative of the Kremlin. He worked for Ukraine, not Putin. Indeed, for much of his time in Ukraine, he pushed his clients against Putin's interests.

Mueller's prosecutors looked on glumly Thursday as Manafort was sentenced to a mere 47 months' imprisonment by Judge T. S. Ellis III of the federal court in Alexandria, Va. After rescinding the cooperation agreement they had extended Manafort following his convictions at trial, Mueller's team had pressed for a sentence of up to 24 years for the 70-year-old former Trump campaign chairman. The judge demurred, pointedly observing that Manafort was ""not before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence [the 2016] election.""

The prosecutors won't be chagrined long, of course. Against Manafort, one case with a potential century of jail time was not enough. There's a case in Washington, too. There, Manafort will be sentenced next week, by a different judge who will surely impose a sentence more to the special counsel's liking. The knowledge of that, more than anything else, explains Judge Ellis's comparative wrist-slap, which ignored sentencing guidelines that called for a severe prison term.

Those guidelines were driven by prodigious financial fraud, not espionage. No one has even alleged espionage -- even though the investigation was aggressive, even though the two indictments charge numerous felonies, and even though Mueller has had as his star informant witness Manafort's longtime sidekick, Richard Gates, a fellow fraudster who was deeply involved in his partner's work for foreign governments.

Understand: Paul Manafort would never have been prosecuted if he had not joined Donald Trump's campaign. He would not have been prosecuted if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election and spared Democrats the need to conjure up a reason to explain their defeat -- something other than nominating a lousy candidate who stopped campaigning too early.

Manafort's Ukrainian work was not a secret. By the time of the 2016 campaign, he'd been at it for over a dozen years. He wasn't alone. Not even close. An array of American political consultants flocked to post-Soviet Ukraine because that's where the money was. Manafort worked for the Party of Regions, led by Yanukovych. The Obama consultants worked for Yanukovych's rival, Yulia Tymoshenko -- the populist-socialist who sometimes colluded with Putin and other times posed as his opponent. The Clinton consultants lined up with Viktor Yuschenko, Putin's generally pro-Western b√™te noire, who was nearly assassinated by Kremlin operatives and who navigated between east and west.

What you may already notice is that Ukraine is complicated. That collusion narrative you've been sold since November 8, 2016? It's a caricature.

The people peddling it know that Americans are clueless about the intricacies of politics in a former Soviet satellite and the grubby bipartisan cesspool of international political consultancy. You are thus to believe that the Party of Regions was nothing but a cat's paw of Moscow; that Manafort went to work for Yanukovych, the party's Putin puppet; and that Manafort's entr√©e into the Trump campaign was a Kremlin coup, a Russian plot to control of the White House.

Sure. But then . . . where's the collusion charge? If that's what happened, where is the special counsel's big indictment of a Trump-Russia conspiracy, with Manafort at its core?

There is no such case because the collusion narrative distorts reality.

Manafort is not a good guy. He did business and made lots of money with Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs who, largely through their organized-crime connections, made their fortunes in the post-Soviet gangster-capitalism era, when the spoils of an empire were up for grabs.

Manafort got himself deeply in hock with some of these tycoons. He may owe over $25 million to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate. Deripaska, you've repeatedly been told, is Putin's oligarch. That may be true -- they are close enough for Putin to have intervened on his behalf when the U.S. government imposed travel restrictions. But former senator Bob Dole intervened on Deripaska's behalf, too. So did the FBI, when they thought Deripaska could help them rescue an agent detained in Iran. So did Christopher Steele, the former British spy of Steele-dossier infamy.

Having business with Deripaska did not make Manafort a Russian spy. No more than taking $500,000 from a Kremlin-tied bank made Bill Clinton a Russian spy. For a quarter century, the United States government encouraged commerce with Russia, notwithstanding that it is anti-American and run like a Mafia family. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton worked with the Putin regime to develop Moscow's version of Silicon Valley. Business with Russia was like what the Clintons used to tell us about lies about sex: Everybody does it.

Manafort's business eventually soured. There is good reason to believe that, once he was installed as chairman of the Trump campaign -- when Trump looked like a sure GOP-nomination winner and general-election loser -- Manafort tried to monetize his position of influence. He hoped to make himself ""whole,"" as he put it, by demonstrating that he was once again a political force to be reckoned with -- offering Deripaska briefings on the campaign, offering his Ukrainian oligarch benefactors polling data showing that Trump had a real chance to win.

Manafort likes the high life. Running with this crowd helped him live it, and helped him hide most of his money overseas, in accounts he could stealthily access without sharing his millions with the taxman.

But all that said, Manafort was not a Russian agent. Even Robert Mueller, who went after him hammer and tongs, never accused him of that.

When his Ukrainian oligarch sponsors asked him to take Yanukovych on as a client, Manafort was reluctant. Yanukovych was essentially a thug who grew up in the Soviet system. The corruption of the 2004 presidential election, which Yanukovych's Kremlin-backed supporters tried to steal, ignited Kiev's Orange Revolution. Manafort, a cold-blooded Republican operative who had cut his teeth fighting off the Reagan revolution in the 1976 Ford campaign, calculated that Yanukovych was damaged goods.

But in the shadowy world of international political consultancy, money talks and scruple walks. Manafort's oligarch patrons made the Regions reconstruction project worth his while. He remade Yanukovych from the ground up: Learn English, warm to Europe, embrace integration in the European Union, endorse competitive democracy, be the candidate of both EU-leaning Kiev and Russia-leaning Donbas.

This was not a Putin agenda. It was an agenda for Ukraine, a country with a split personality that needs cordial relations with the neighborhood bully to the east as it fitfully lurches westward. Regions was a pro-Russia party, but that is not the same thing as being Russia. What the oligarchs want is autonomy so they can run their profitable fiefdoms independent of Kiev. They leverage Moscow against the EU . . . except when they talk up EU integration to ensure that they are not swallowed up by Moscow. What the oligarchs mainly are is corrupt, which suited Manafort fine.

The unsavory business was successful for a time. Regions returned to power. Yanukovych finally won the presidency and immediately announced that ""integration with the EU remains our strategic aim."" It was a triumph for Manafort, but a short-lived one. While Yanukovych rhapsodized about rising to Western standards, he ran his administration in the Eastern authoritarian style, enriching his allies and imprisoning his rivals.

The latter included Tymoshenko, who was prosecuted over a gas deal she had entered when she was prime minister -- with Putin. Russia bitterly criticized her prosecution, and when she was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, the Kremlin blasted Yanukovych's government for pursuing her ""exclusively for political motives."" Manafort, meanwhile, continued to airbrush Yanukovych's image in the West, scheming with lobbyists and a law firm to help him defend the controversial Tymoshenko trial -- a scheme abetted by lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who eventually pled guilty to making false statements to Mueller's investigators.

Yanukovych's moment of truth came in late 2013. He was poised to sign the Association Agreement with the EU, a framework for integration. Putin furiously turned up the heat: blocking Ukrainian imports, drastically reducing Ukrainian exports, bleeding billions of trade dollars from Kiev's economy, threatening to cut off all gas supplies and drive Ukraine into default. Manafort pleaded with his client to stick with the EU. Yanukovych caved, however, declining to enter the Association Agreement and making an alternative pact with Putin to assure gas supplies and financial aid.

It was over this decision that the Euromaidan protests erupted. Yanukovych fled the country in early 2014, given sanctuary in Moscow. Subsequently, Regions renounced Yanukovych, blaming him for the outbreak of violence and for looting the treasury. The party disbanded, with many of its members reemerging as the Opposition Bloc, the party to which Manafort gravitated -- along with his partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, and his lobbyist associate, W. Samuel Patten. (Like Manafort, Patten has pled guilty to working as an unregistered agent of Ukraine; Kilimnik, who is in Russia, was indicted by Mueller for helping Manafort tamper with witnesses.)

Paul Manafort is a scoundrel. He was willing to do most anything for money -- even offering to burnish Putin's image as he burnished Yanukovych's. But Manafort was never a Kremlin operative working against his own country, except in the fever dreams of the Clinton campaign's Steele dossier. And his crimes notwithstanding, he'd be a free man today if Mrs. Clinton had won. Instead, he'll be sentenced yet again next week. And this time, he'll get slammed.",451,nationalreview.com,"Paul Manafort Was an Agent of Ukraine, Not Russia | National Review"
"The Democratic party is organized around assertions of victimhood to intimidate their critics.

I have a new hobby. It's collecting the excuses Democrats make for Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democratic congresswoman who has an unhealthy fixation on Jewish influence, Jewish money, and Jewish loyalty. Omar has said that Israel ""hypnotized the world,"" ascribing to Jews the power of mind control in the service of manipulating public opinion. She's said the only reason Congress supports Israel is Jewish campaign donations. Most recently, using the classic anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalty, she criticized supporters of Israel for having ""allegiance to a foreign power."" A real treasure, Omar is. A typical freshman congresswoman sees her mission as -- forgive the expression -- bringing home the bacon for her district. Not Ilhan. Her project is to mainstream anti-Semitic rhetoric within the Democratic party. Once upon a time, you'd have to visit the invaluable website of the Middle East Media Research Institute to hear such tripe. Now you just need to flip on C-SPAN.

And Democrats are powerless to stop it. They're tripping over themselves, making rationalizations, dodging reality, and trying to clean up this anti-Semitic mess. Omar is new to this, they say. She never intended to come across as anti-Semitic. She can't help it. ""She comes from a different culture."" She didn't know what she was saying -- she's a moron! She's just trying to ""start a conversation"" about the policies of Israel's government. And why are you singling her out, anyway. ""She is living through a lot of pain."" She's black, she's a woman, and she's Muslim. You can't condemn her without also condemning white men of privilege. What are you, racist? Islamophobic? Shame on you for picking on this poor lady, who just happens to say that American Jews serve a foreign power by buying off politicians and using the Force to blinker people's minds.

Before such ""arguments"" -- they are really assertions of victimhood to intimidate critics -- Nancy Pelosi shudders. She's supposed to be this Iron Lady, returned to power after exile, ruling her caucus with a vise-like grip. But her hands are covered in Palmolive. She's spent the first weeks of Congress doing little more than responding to the various insanities of Omar and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Pelosi will condemn Omar one minute, before appearing with her on the cover of Rolling Stone the next. She's lost a step. She can't hold her caucus together when Republicans call for motions to recommit on the House floor. The policies her candidates ran on in swing districts vanished under the solar-powered glare of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal. We're not talking about covering preexisting conditions, we're pledging to rid the world once and for all of the scourges of air travel and cow flatulence. Pelosi's trigger-happy committee chairmen, firing their subpoena cannons into the air at random, look like goofballs desperate to impeach President Trump.

Whatever control Pelosi had over her majority vanished the second she delayed the resolution condemning Omar. It then became undeniable that AOC & co. is in charge. Identity politics has rendered the Democrats incapable of criticizing anti-Semitism so long as it dons the wardrobe of intersectionality. It's nothing short of incredible that three women from three different cities -- New York, Detroit, and Minneapolis -- can run roughshod over 233 other House Democrats with a little help from social media, woke 24-year-olds in the digital press, and the Congressional Black Caucus. If you're Ocasio-Cortez right now, you must love life from the comfort of the test kitchen in your luxury D.C. apartment building. What's next for this trio -- two of whom are members of the Democratic Socialists of America, two of whom support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement that seeks Israel's destruction, and all three of whom combine radical anti-American politics with radical self-regard -- finding a candidate to primary pro-Israel Democrat Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, on which Omar sits? Challenging Chuck Schumer in the Democratic primary when he's up for reelection in 2022?

The most pressing order of business has got to be the 2020 presidential election. Omar, AOC, and Tlaib don't strike me as Cory Booker supporters. Amy Klobuchar might be too much of a taskmaster for them. Most likely the radicals will line up behind the current frontrunner, Bernie Sanders, who has already surrounded himself with anti-Israel activists. Sanders has said criticism of Omar is just a means to ""stifle debate"" over Israel's government. He's too smart to believe that. As the most successful Jewish presidential candidate in history, he has a responsibility to draw lines. After all, he's no stranger to the dual-loyalty charge -- though of course in his case the other country was the Soviet Union.

Bernie Sanders has no interest in stopping Omar. He recognizes that she represents the impending transformation of the Democratic party into something more closely resembling the British Labour party. Labourites elected avowed socialist Jeremy Corbyn party leader in September 2015. The years since have been spent in one anti-Semitism scandal after another. Sanders wants desperately to be the American Corbyn. If anti-Semitism is the price of a socialist America, so be it. Remember what Stalin said about the omelette. I'm sure Bernie does. If Democrats can't rebuke Omar swiftly and definitively, if they have trouble competing with Ocasio-Cortez's Instagram cooking show, how will they be able to stop Sanders from carrying his devoted bloc of supporters to plurality victories in the early primaries, and using the divided field to gain momentum just as Trump did?

So far this year the Democrats have floundered in a pit of racism, sexual assault, and anti-Semitism. They've embraced policies akin to infanticide, and announced plans to expropriate wealth, pay reparations for slavery, eliminate private health insurance within two years, and rebuild or retrofit every building in the United States before the world ends from climate change twelve years from now. Throughout it all, they've received a pass from the know-nothing media. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Sanders have all made the claim that Omar has done nothing but criticize the policies of Bibi Netanyahu. That's a bald-faced lie, a falsehood not one of the hundreds upon hundreds of reporters covering the Democratic field has scrutinized. These are the very people who have spent the past three years sermonizing on the importance of truth in politics, and they are doing Bernie's work for him. Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution insists that the Democratic party continues to be center-left. But the election returns and publi- opinion data that support her thesis become much less important when the party's biggest stars make a hard-left turn. The Democrats seem ripe for a takeover by Bernie and his pals, or at least for a blistering and incendiary battle for control similar to what the GOP experienced last time around.

Blame for Democratic radicalization is most often assigned to Trump -- there's little he isn't blamed for -- but it really ought to go to President Obama. It was Obama who established ""daylight"" between the United States and Israel, who blamed opposition to his Iran deal on ""money"" from ""lobbyists,"" who failed to veto a U.N. resolution singling out the Jewish State and declaring its settlements to have ""no legal validity."" It was Obama's disastrous second term -- when he handed the reins of governance to an administrative state immune from popular sovereignty, when he flouted the Constitution in expanding his administrative amnesty, when he made overtures to hostile governments in Iran and Cuba -- that set into motion the decline of the American center-left. Now the Obama bros defend Omar on their podcast and in their newsletter, and bolster the presidential candidacy of Robert Francis ""Beto"" ""Take the Wall Down"" O'Rourke. If Obama really wanted to arrest the Democrats' slide into socialism and anti-Semitism, he'd speak out. Do you think Joe Biden will able to stop it? Fat chance. The odds of a Bernie Sanders nomination, a Howard Schultz candidacy, and a Donald Trump victory increase every time Ilhan Omar opens her mouth.",452,nationalreview.com,Ilhan Omar and the Collapse of the Center-Left
"If those two men who wanted a wedding cake had simply gone to another bakery when Jack Phillips declined their order, Colorado's taxpayers would have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars and we all would have been spared a thoroughly unnecessary Supreme Court case. Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission limped to a finish earlier this week when the Commission dropped its complaint against Phillips. But its echoes continue to resound in an off-Broadway play, The Cake, which has just opened at the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City Center after a six-week run in Los Angeles.

The play does not grapple with legal issues, which is probably just as well. Instead it examines the intersecting obligations of faith, friendship, conscience, and tolerance. As the title suggests, the central issue is a cake. Della (Debra Jo Rupp) owns a bakery in North Carolina, and she and her husband are Evangelical Christians who both put great stress on following rules and doing things the right way. So when Jen (Genevieve Angelson), the beloved daughter of a deceased close friend, who now lives in New York, asks Della to bake a cake for her wedding, Della is delighted -- until she finds out that Jen is marrying a woman, whereupon she finds an excuse to decline the order and everyone quickly gets all huffy. (Marinda Anderson plays Jen's intended, Macy, a firebrand journalist; Dan Daily plays Della's blowhard husband, a weary and practical-minded plumber who finds gay sex as disgusting as sushi and vegetarianism. The director is Lynne Meadow, the playwright is Bekah Brunstetter, and the impressive sets are by John Lee Beatty.)

The Cake's design becomes apparent early on. It's the kind of story in which every character's dominant flaw -- harsh, rigid, weak, rude, silly, indecisive, etc. -- is overdrawn when we first meet them, and you know immediately that by the end of the play the judgmental ones will soften up, the wishy-washy ones will find some backbone, and everybody will quarrel with one another and then reconcile. It's a level or two above the Afterschool Special-for-grownups template that underlies most of the movies you swipe past on Netflix, but it doesn't quite manage to transcend the limitations of its familiar plot.

The play begins with Della declaiming on how her years as a baker have taught her the importance of making cakes (and, by implication, doing everything else) the right way, with no shortcuts or substitutions. The story hinges on her monologue about the Bible and its stern notions of sin, which she sifts through in search of a way around them like John Roberts struggling to find a loophole in his originalist principles. In the end, you won't be surprised to learn, she manages to find a Roberts-like solution to her confectionary dilemma.

The characters all turn out to have had formative experiences in their past that led to major crises or realizations. One of them is prone to sadistic sexual fantasies, which she narrates at uncomfortable length in a couple of spots, to everyone's befuddlement (onstage and off -- audience members were giving each other puzzled looks). In the play's otherwise upbeat context, these interludes are like biting into a cupcake and finding a lug nut.

Parallels and connections between food and sex, and between politics and religion, abound. Macy is liberated about sex but uptight about food; after refusing to eat a bite of cake, she lectures Della on the evils of the sugar industry and ""factory farms."" Underneath all this, she resents Della for being thin and struggles to suppress her own sinful food cravings. Her inflexible dogmatism, combined with her mockery of Della's religious beliefs, recalls the familiar G. K. Chesterton paraphrase ""When you stop believing in God, you'll believe in anything,"" and indeed, she evangelically insists that everyone must be political, because ""ambivalence is just as lethal as violence."" Della, meanwhile, loves food but is fearful about sex; she craves more romance and tenderness from her husband and is secretly jealous of Macy's passionate relationship with Jen (which is shaken when Jen's speech becomes more southern and she brings Della a snack from Chick-fil-A).

In the final scene, Della quotes some moving lines about love, which Macy is surprised to hear are from 1 Corinthians, at which point Macy concedes that maybe Della, Christianity, and the South aren't as fearsome as she had thought (and maybe eating the occasional bite of cake isn't, either). So everyone comes out of the blow-up a little wiser and a little happier and a little more humble than they were before -- just like real life, sort of. If you enjoy live theater and don't mind paying New York prices, this evenhanded-by-liberal-standards play may be worth a visit. If not, just imagine what an Oscar-nominated movie inspired by Masterpiece Cakeshop would look like, and you won't be too far off.",453,nationalreview.com,"'The Cake' Explores Obligations of Faith, Conscience, and Tolerance"
"Venezuela experiences one of the largest power outages in years, as the blackout hits 22 out of 23 Venezuelan states.

When Hugo Chavez turned Venezuela into a socialist state, he started with the oil industry. In 2007, leftists around the world rejoiced when the strongman ordered a government takeover of the industry to fund government handouts and more welfare programs.

Socialist scholar Noam Chomsky praised Chavez. Progressive author David Sirota called it an ""economic miracle."" Scores of Hollywood A-listers jetted to Venezuela for photo-ops. Michael Moore, Sean Penn, Oliver Stone and Danny Glover all stood with Chavez and bashed America.

Chavez fired thousands of oil employees, executives and workers, replacing them with 80,000 political operatives. When Chavez threatened foreign corporations, they abandoned Venezuela, taking billions of dollars in investment with them. Big Socialism failed to produce the same amount of oil for the same cost, and Venezuela's economy began its inevitable collapse.

THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM: IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. IT'S ABOUT KEEPING THE RULING CLASS' POWER

Chavez also seized control of the power companies. The consequences there were similar: The public transportation system collapsed last year. Those who have a vehicle wait hours to fill the tanks. Fuel shortages are rampant. The current Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, blames the Trump administration, but as the nation with the world's largest oil reserves, Venezuela should be able to produce energy for its own citizens. After all, the state-run oil company has 80,000 employees.

Power outages are now commonplace, as is power rationing. Without a stable electric grid, what remains of Venezuela's agriculture, manufacturing and business sectors are on the path to ruin. The little food that is produced cannot make it to market. Goods and services cannot be sold.

It is not surprising that more than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the nation. Food and water are basic needs, but without energy to run the economy, Venezuela may as well be a post-apocalyptic society in a zombie movie.

Fast forward to the present day. The average citizen of Venezuela has lost 19 pounds from malnutrition. Starving people are eating zoo animals. With inflation running 42,000 percent, a dozen eggs cost $29,000. If you're hoping to buy a chicken to lay these ""golden"" eggs, you'll have to save over $14 million.

Sean Penn hasn't returned to Venezuela. Noam Chomsky will say ""that isn't real socialism."" Doubtful Danny Glover waits a day for gas. Michael Moore probably doesn't eat zoo animals.

The entirety of the economic collapse, the ruination of people, the destruction of a state, the misery, sorrow, violence and death - all of it was completely avoidable and predictable.

Sadly, Venezuela-style brownouts are becoming more common worldwide because politicians are embracing the socialist tendencies of green politics. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnball was voted out of office when his ""green energy"" vision caused blackouts throughout the nation. Germany has regular blackouts because green energy cannot power the grid. An unstable supply of energy to the grid has caused brownouts in California. In New England, which is embracing green energy at the cost of fossil fuels, the future looks precarious.

Chavez called oil companies greedy polluters in order to get elected. His intentions sounded noble, but as is always the case with socialism, the true motives and resulting consequences were equally dismal.

Here in America, socialist politicians want to follow the same playbook to take over the energy industry in the name of fighting climate change. Nationalizing the energy industry, whether it's in the name of the people or the environment, will always lead to the same outcome: misery.

Politicians like to attack ""big oil."" Little praise is ever offered to the energy industry or its ability to find sludge miles underground, extract it responsibly, refine it, and get it to your local gas station for less than the price of bottled water.

Energy has made life in America so inexpensive that big oil hater Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., owns multiple homes and charters private jets. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., author of the socialist Green New Deal, has yet to acknowledge that abundant domestic oil provides the infrastructure that allows her oil-bashing Instagram videos to go viral.

"CNN is under fire after hiring Jeff Sessions-era Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur

It appears that CNN's latest hire is already being reassigned after the news of her employment sparked outrage from the left.

Last month, CNN announced that Sarah Isgur, a former spokeswoman for the Department of Justice under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and GOP strategist, was hired as a political editor assigned to coverage of the 2020 presidential election.

The hire ruffled feathers among many employees at the network and triggered an uproar from liberals on Twitter because of her lack of experience in journalism and her former alliance with big-name Republicans such as Sessions, Mitt Romney and Carly Fiorina.

CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO ACCUSED OF POLITICIZING ALEX TREBEK'S CANCER DIAGNOSIS

CNN assured the Democratic National Committee that Isgur would not have any involvement in the Democratic primary debates nor would she have any ""editorial decision-making control over the network's coverage of the 2020 election.""

Well, Democrats have nothing to worry about now because Isgur announced on Twitter that she will no longer become a political editor but instead a political analyst who will appear on air and write online.

CNN confirmed the role shift but claimed it was all Isgur's idea.

""We can confirm that when Sarah came to us and proposed her role be adjusted to a political analyst instead, we agreed and we look forward to her starting in that role,"" a CNN spokesman said.

The liberal news network was panned for that decision as well. Washington Post media critic Eric Wemple says CNN ""embarrassed itself"" amid the controversy.

""We can confirm that this episode exposes the perils of living on the narrow median strip of American politics. As we've argued before, CNN hired Isgur because of its efforts to stay in the middle lane. And it presided over her role reduction because of its efforts to stay in the middle lane. Hire people you believe in; stand behind them,"" Wemple wrote.

"Over the past week, Pakistani authorities have initiated a crackdown on militant groups operating in Kashmir, including Jaish-e-Mohammed, seizing their property and assets and banning them from operating.

However, analysts are warning that the crackdown could spark a backlash among large swathes of the population, with groups previously receiving support from the military and intelligence services. They are also known to provide charitable services, meaning they enjoy support among the poor.

""Pakistan, if it takes an aggressive, no-tolerance stand against Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harakat ul-Mujahidin, will suffer a violent backlash domestically,"" warned Adnan Naseemullah, an expert in international affairs at King's College in London. ""But a zero-tolerance policy from the Pakistani state will over time shift the focus back on Kashmir and the treatment of the Kashmiri people, which is in Pakistan's long-term interest.""

Last week, Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry rejected accusations from India that the Pakistani government was involved in last month's suicide attack in Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary police, declaring it had ""nothing to do"" with them. However, he also announced a new strategy to crack down on the militants behind the attack.

""A full-fledged strategy is now in place,"" Chaudhry said ""We have different strategies for different groups, but the main aim is that we have to enforce the writ of the state. We have to demilitarize if there are groups (on our soil).""

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan said at a rally in southern Pakistan on Thursday reiterated that his government would step up its crackdown against the militants.

""This government will not allow Pakistan's land to be used for any kind of outside terrorism,"" he said. ""We will not allow any militant group to function in our country now. God willing, you will see that a new era is emerging.""

Pakistan has long been the subject of global criticism for its failure to stop the rise of militant and terrorist organizations in its territory. In 2017, the country's military began a campaign to deradicalize groups and encourage them to get involved in politics, a move that was heavily criticized by civil society groups and human rights organizations.",456,Breitbart,Popular Support for Pakistani Militants Complicates Government
"The state Houses in Georgia and Tennessee have passed measures that would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected -- usually six or seven weeks into pregnancy.

In Atlanta, Georgia, the legislation passed Thursday night, 93-73, but not without significant debate and tension.

Some Democrats made a point of walking out before the bill was even introduced, reported WSBTV:

In a remarkable show of defiance, House Democrats turned their backs on the Acworth lawmaker sponsoring the so-called heartbeat bill before it was introduced.

House Speaker David Ralston reprimanded them.

""I guess we have people in violation of the rules of the House. The gentleman will proceed, and this will be dealt with later,"" he said.

State Rep. Ed Setzler, who sponsored House Bill 481, said his legislation ""seeks to recognize that the child in the womb that is living distinct from their mother has a right of life that is worthy of protection.""

Prior to the vote to approve the heartbeat abortion ban, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement:

Georgia is a state that values life. We shield the vulnerable and shelter the innocent. I applaud the Health and Human Services Committee for advancing legislation to protect the unborn. I encourage the House and Senate to do the same. This is a powerful moment in Georgia. It's bigger than politics and partisanship. Let's champion life today and ensure that all Georgians - including the unborn - have the chance to live, grow, and prosper.

Planned Parenthood Southeast condemned the state House's approval of the legislation:

Jane Robbins, who is affiliated with Concerned Women for America, noted the sharp divide between states allowing abortion even moments before birth and those protecting human life as early as possible.

""While some states are moving to protect infanticide, last night the Georgia House joined other state legislatures going in the opposite direction - protecting innocent human life even in its early stages,"" she told Breitbart News. ""We think with the leadership of the Governor and Lt. Governor, we can get this done in the Senate as well. Thousands of lives are at stake.""

House lawmakers in Tennessee also passed a similar bill Thursday. House Bill 77 was approved 65-21.

""Colleagues, we cannot continue to allow the slaughter of the unborn while we hope for better circumstances,"" said bill sponsor Micah Van Huss, a Republican, from the House floor, according to the Tennessean.

GOP Rep. Matthew Hill called the legislation ""long overdue,"" but he urged the state House to also adopt an amendment - which it approved - that would ensure the state's current 20-week abortion ban remains in place if the heartbeat legislation is struck down in court.

""It is not overly complicated,"" Hill said. ""We have a responsibility as the representatives of our districts, of our citizens, to ensure that life, innocent life, is protected in all its stages. We will be able to inject some common sense into our code.""

Tennessee Right to Life, however, has not endorsed the heartbeat legislation.

According to a press release, the pro-life organization expressed concern that the heartbeat bills of other states, such as North Dakota, Arkansas, and Iowa, have been struck down as unconstitutional.

Instead, the Right to Life group is endorsing the Human Life Protection Act (HB 1029), which has been drafted by pro-life constitutional attorney Paul B. Linton and sponsored by GOP state Rep. Susan Lynn.

""HB 1029 provides broader protections for the unborn and abortion-vulnerable women by restoring Tennessee's pre-Roe statutes upon the overturn of Roe, in full or in part, by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Tennessee Right to Life stated. ""As a result, HB 1029 does not face the same legal challenges as the heartbeat ban for the possibility of building additional case law in support of Roe's precedent.""",457,Breitbart,Tennessee and Georgia State Houses Pass Fetal Heartbeat Abortion Bans
"Ideas that Bernie Sanders made popular -- like free college, a federal jobs guarantee and Medicare for all -- are now borrowed by other top tier Democratic candidates; Peter Doocy reports from Des Moines, Iowa.

Announcing his second bid for the presidency March 2, Sen. Bernie Sanders drew a massive crowd in Brooklyn, estimated at 13,000 by his campaign. But can he do the same in Peoria?

The answer, unequivocally, is yes. His performance in the 2016 primaries showed that the Vermont socialist enjoys broad appeal in Middle America.

That may seem surprising, given the media's focus on Sanders as a far-left progressive who never shies away from the socialist label and its depiction of ""fly-over"" country as the domain of backward-looking conservatives.

AS BERNIE SANDERS LAUNCHES 2020 CAMPAIGN, HERE'S A LOOK AT HIS ECONOMIC POLICIES

These narratives would lead you to believe that Sanders and Middle America would be the political equivalent of oil and water. But like most political narratives, these are incomplete. And if they've led you to assume that President Trump would easily trounce the aging socialist in the interior in the presidential election next year, think again.

Sanders' base may be dyed-in-the-wool progressives, but his support extends far beyond that. In the 2016 Democratic primaries, rural working-class voters vastly preferred Sanders over Hillary Clinton.

And while that's common knowledge, what is often overlooked is the fact that 10 percent of all those who backed Sanders in the primaries cast their votes for Trump in the general election. More importantly, these voters were the deciding margin in states like Wisconsin and Michigan.

Without the Sanders crossovers, Trump would not be president today.

How can a Bernie Bro also be a Donald Dude? This voting phenomenon tells us that working-class voters are disenchanted with the status quo.

The dynamic will become one of the central battlegrounds for 2020. Who can keep the working- class voter in the fold?

For Trump and the GOP, the challenge is to identify a policy agenda that continues to attract working-class voters while retaining middle-class voters, suburban Republicans and base conservatives.

President Trump's trade policies, his China crackdown, deregulation and tax cuts are a good start. But more is needed to win over millions of working-class voters and ensure their long-term participation in a GOP coalition.

For his part, Sanders has the most working-class street cred of all the announced Democrats. However, he will likely have a much harder time appealing to this demographic in 2020, given the actions of many of his colleagues and the party in general.

With the election of freshman Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and others, the Democratic Party has careened to the left - and not just on economic policy where Sanders felt comfortable.

Democrats have doubled down on identity politics in a way that threatens to undermine the broad appeal Sanders enjoyed in 2016.

If you look back on his 2016 run, you'll see that Sanders wasn't an identity politics warrior the way many in the party are now.

Sanders emphasized unity, patriotism and economic socialism. It was a message that did resonate - and probably still will - in Middle America.

But to convincingly convey that message, Sanders this time around will need to intentionally separate himself from the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez crowd. And that won't be easy.

Look at the last few months. As Matt Continetti writes in the Washington Free Beacon: ""So far this year the Democrats have floundered in a pit of racism, sexual assault, and anti-Semitism. They've embraced policies akin to infanticide, and announced plans to expropriate wealth, pay reparations for slavery, eliminate private health insurance within two years, and rebuild or retrofit every building in the United States before the world ends from climate change 12 years from now.""

"BEAUREGARD, Ala. - Standing near the slab that's all that is left of one family's garage, President Donald Trump on Friday surveyed the devastation wrought by a powerful tornado that ripped through a rural Alabama town, uprooting trees, tearing homes from their foundations and killing nearly two dozen people.

""We saw things that you wouldn't believe,"" said Trump, overlooking a debris field strewn with branches and other wreckage in Beauregard, which bore the brunt of Sunday's storm. Mangled metal siding, wood planks, piping and electric wires lay strewn on the ground, along with remnants of everyday life: clothing, a sofa, a bottle of Lysol cleaner and a welcome mat encrusted with dirt.

Trump and the first lady spent the afternoon meeting with survivors, victims' families and volunteers trying to rebuild after the massive tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with ten victims belonging to a single extended family.

The trip was a familiar one for Trump, who, now in the third year of his presidency, has traveled to the sites of numerous disasters and tragedies, including hurricanes, shootings and wildfires.

The day began with an aerial survey of the area by helicopter, which flew over swaths of land where trees had been flattened. Trump and his wife, Melania, also visited a church serving as a makeshift disaster relief center for survivors. He later observed a moment of silence before white wooden crosses commemorating each of the victims.

Head bowed, Trump and his wife held hands as they paused in front of each of the markers. Trump shook his head as he stood in front of one, which had been decorated with a tiny pair of children's sneakers.

Trump has, at times, struggled with his role as consoler-in-chief during trips to survey damage and meet with tragedy victims. He memorably tossed paper towels into a crowd as he surveyed damage following hurricanes in Puerto Rico -- a move that some saw as inappropriate given the circumstances -- and marveled at a yacht that floodwaters had deposited on a family's property during a trip to the Carolinas.

""At least you got a nice boat out of the deal,"" Trump told the family. He was caught on camera telling a person to whom he had just handed food to ""have a good time.""

This time, however, Trump appeared to avoid any such distractions aside from some hubbub caused by his decision to sign Bibles, which Providence Baptist Church had been distributing, along with clothing and other supplies, including diapers, toiletries and personal care products.

Before signing autographs or posing for photos with the volunteers there, Trump thanked law enforcement officials and other first responders, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is assisting state and local response efforts.

""I wanted to come the day it happened,"" he said, adding that Gov. Kay Ivey had asked him to wait.

Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grade volunteer and signed the child's Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. Ingram said the president also signed her sister's Bible.

The pastor, Rusty Sowell, said the president's visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.

""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" Sowell said.

Earlier, Trump spent time with three families who lost loved ones, hearing their stories and dispensing hugs. He also met privately with survivors and family members, including a woman mourning the loss of 10 relatives.

""What they've been through is incredible,"" Trump said after emerging from the meeting.

Before Trump arrived in Beauregard, Renee Frazier stood amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother's home and waved as the helicopter carrying Trump passed overhead. Minutes before, Frazier, whose mother survived the tornado, had been arguing with relatives who opposed Trump's visit, calling it more about politics than compassion.

Frazier disagreed.

""I want the president here to see what happened to my mom's house,"" she said. ""I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity.""

Down the road, where several people died, Trump supporter Bobby Spann said he hoped the president had learned ""how to be a Southerner and how to respect people"" during his brief visit.

Spann said he also hoped Trump realized how much help is needed.

""Houses need to be replaced. You can't help the dead folks, but you can try to help the ones that's still living,"" said Spann, chewing on a yellowroot twig. The tornado had partially peeled away the roof of Spann's mobile home.

Trump had said before the visit that he'd instructed FEMA to give Alabama ""the A Plus treatment"" as it recovers -- rhetoric that stood in contrast to Trump's response to disasters on less politically friendly territory. Alabama supported Trump by a wide margin in the 2016 presidential election, and he carried about 60 percent of the vote in Lee County, where Beauregard is located. Blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent sight in the town, and many were seen waving Friday.

In the months after wildfires scorched California, a Democrat-led state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, Trump threatened to cut off federal aid unless the state embraced forest management policies he championed.

He also engaged in a sustained back-and-forth with lawmakers from hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico, whose pro-statehood governor identifies as a Democrat. Trump repeatedly blamed the U.S. territory for its problems and noted how much money recovery efforts had cost the federal government.

The administration also considered redirecting disaster aid from those places to pay for Trump's long-promised border wall but ultimately decided to target other funding sources.

"Andrew Sullivan comments on the U.S.-Israel relationship and the role of ""pro-Israel"" lobbying groups in our politics in a new essay. There are several things that I think Sullivan gets wrong, but perhaps the most significant and pervasive error in the piece is his repeated description of the relationship an ""alliance."" He notes that the U.S. gets nothing in return for the extensive military and diplomatic support that it provides, he acknowledges that the U.S. ""suffers internationally"" on account of its close relationship with Israel, and he marvels at how badly its government under Netanyahu has behaved towards the U.S. Nonetheless, he writes, ""I would defend the alliance despite this, because of my core belief in a Jewish state."" The trouble with all this is that there is no alliance and Israel is not our ally. Its government does not behave as an ally does, it has never fought alongside U.S. forces in any of our foreign wars, and its interests are not aligned with ours as an ally's should be. There is no formal treaty and no binding obligations that require our governments to do anything for the other.

There are few words in U.S. foreign policy debates used more frequently and with less precision than ally and alliance. Our politicians and pundits use these terms to refer to almost every state with which the U.S. has some kind of security relationship, and it always grossly exaggerates the nature and extent of the ties between our governments. The exaggeration in Israel's case is greatest of all because it is routinely called our ""most important ally"" in the region, or even our ""most cherished ally"" in all the world. These are ideological assertions that are not grounded in any observable reality. Dozens of other states all over the world are better allies to the United States than the ""most cherished ally"" is, and they don't preside over an illegal occupation that implicates the U.S. in decades of abuses and crimes against the Palestinian people living under that occupation, but none of them enjoys the lockstep, uncritical backing that this one state does. The effect of this constant repetition is to make the U.S.-Israel relationship seem extremely important to U.S. interests when it is not, and that serves to promote the ""illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists."" It is this illusion as much as anything else that prevents a serious reassessment of the relationship.

Israel is one of America's regional clients, and it is the one that the U.S. indulges more than any other, but that is all that it is. As such, it receives far more support than it needs to and far more than makes sense for the U.S. to give, and the overwhelming political support that the relationship has is out of all proportion to the value of the relationship to the United States. In fact, like several other regional clients Israel has increasingly become a liability for the U.S., and the relationship should be changed accordingly.",460,The American Conservative,Israel Is Not America's Ally
"Have Democrats reduced their chances of denying President Trump a second term by continuing to focus on throwing him out before the end of his first? You can make a good case they have.

Democrats have been itching to oust Trump since the days before he took the oath of office. Obama administration law-enforcement and intelligence agencies launched investigations into candidate Trump's campaign, contrary to the general rule that such agencies should avoid interfering with electoral politics.

Astonishingly, they relied primarily, if not exclusively, on information bought and paid for by the Clinton campaign, in the Steele dossier. Then-FBI Director James Comey briefed the dossier's most salacious allegation to the incoming president, an act he presumably considered a form of blackmail.

The supposition, breathlessly ¬≠reported almost daily by certain cable news channels, is that candidate Trump was in criminal collusion with Vladimir Putin's Russia. But the air has fizzled out of this balloon. Special counsel Robert Mueller, after nearly two years, has produced no indictments pointing to such collusion.

The only collusion that has had a political effect is the belief, held by many Democratic voters, that the Russians somehow switched hundreds of thousands of votes through computer hacking or a handful of diabolically clever Facebook ads. Many such people bitterly cling to their belief that Trump's impeachment and ¬≠removal from office is imminent.

Democratic politicians evidently feel compelled to cater to these ¬≠delusions, even as it becomes ¬≠apparent that the Mueller investigation will soon end without any recommendation or basis for that.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff promises he will conduct extensive hearings.

Not much more forthcoming was House Judiciary Chairman Jerry ¬≠Nadler on ABC News last weekend. ""We do not have the evidence all sorted out and everything to do -- to do an impeachment,"" he said. ""Before you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen. You have to persuade enough of the -- of the opposition-party voters, Trump voters, that you're not just trying to .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. steal the last -- to reverse the results of the last election.""

Nadler says it's ""very clear"" Trump has obstructed justice, but the first sign he points to -- Trump's referring to the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt"" -- is unpersuasive. That's probably not an impeachable offense to many of the 35 percent who told Quinnipiac this month that Congress should start impeachment proceedings now.

Now, it's 28 months since the last presidential election and only 20 months until the next one. In April 2007, after Democrats had just won congressional majorities, Nadler brushed aside calls to impeach then-President George W. Bush. ""The timing is all wrong,"" he told The Washington Times. ""If this were the first two years of his ¬≠administration I would advocate impeachment. A lot of people at home say impeachment, and I'm sure he committed a lot of impeachable offenses, but think about it practically.""

""At home"" for Nadler is upscale parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, areas thick with the urban white college graduates who, along with blacks and Hispanics, are Democrats' strongest constituencies. On many issues these days -- even on racial issues -- they're the party's most left-wing bloc, and probably the voters most determined to oust Trump.

Urban white college grads had the highest turnout rates in mayoral elections in New York two years ago and in Chicago this year. Blacks and Hispanics, in contrast to past decades, were less interested.

It was young white college grads and gentrifiers who elected Rep. ¬≠Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her Queens/Bronx upset last June. And her Green New Deal proposal, ¬≠including things like moving ¬≠toward eliminating beef and private cars, appeals more to that group than it does to blacks and Hispanics.

Pursuing impeachment looks like one more example of Democrats letting AOC-types set their agenda -- and distract them from developing policies that will enthuse ¬≠minorities and appeal to suburbanites whose votes they will need next year.",461,New York Post,Impeachment may lead Democrats off the cliff

On the roster: Bernie boosts Omar as Dems' Israel rift deepens - Biden staffing up with key Latino outreach hire - Poll shows Trump in trouble with Michigan voters - Audible: Nicklebackbenchers - Study accuracy: 100/100

BERNIE BOOSTS OMAR AS DEMS' ISRAEL RIFT DEEPENS

Politico: ""When the latest controversy erupted over Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel, only one 2020 presidential candidate rushed to her defense: Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator, the only Jewish candidate in the Democratic primary, embraced the African-American, Muslim congresswoman... No other presidential contender came out as quickly -- or as forcefully -- as Sanders, who laid down a clear line in the crowded Democratic field between those running as true progressives on foreign policy and those who support an existing U.S. policy that tends to favor Israel over Palestine. Sanders' reaction to Omar's comments -- in which she said Israel's allies 'push for allegiance to a foreign country' -- served other purposes as well: it helped solidify his hold on the party's left wing and dovetailed with his intensified outreach to older African-American voters, a critical constituency that failed to warm to him in 2016.""

Dem frosh turn tables - Fox News: ""The passage Thursday of a broad anti-bigotry resolution that exposed chasms in the Democratic caucus regarding Israel marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who - in a matter of hours - were able to shift the spotlight away from embattled Rep. Ilhan Omar's allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. ... After its passage, Omar and her allies were able to cheer the resolution as a win against Islamophobia. 'Today is historic on many fronts.' ... Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep. Andr√© Carson, D-Ind., said in a joint statement. ... On the sidelines, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's campaign began fundraising, claiming AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) was 'coming after' her, Omar and Tlaib for questioning American foreign policy.""

Omar slams Obama's message of 'hope and change' - Fox News: ""Rookie Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, fresh off igniting an intra-party uproar with comments widely viewed as anti-Semitic, took a swipe at former President Barack Obama, saying in an explosive interview the 44th president's message of 'hope and change' was a 'mirage' and blasting his administration's drone and border detention policies. Omar, D-Minn., took aim at the president's famed slogan, while further criticizing the Democratic Party for 'perpetuating the status quo,' in the interview with Politico. 'Recalling the 'caging of kids' at the U.S.-Mexico border and the 'droning of countries around the world' on Obama's watch,' Omar charged that Obama 'operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor,' the piece reads.""

Tim Alberta: 'The Democrats' dilemma' - Politico: ""[Omar faces] resistance not just from party elders but from many of their fellow freshmen, centrists who campaigned as fixers not firebrands, moderates who are watching warily as the Democrats' brand is being hijacked by the far left. One of these members is Omar's neighbor in Minnesota: Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman who represents the 3rd District. To better understand these dueling visions for the Democratic Party, I sat down with both Omar and Phillips, spent several days in their communities and talked with some of their constituents. What I learned is that, despite the cautionary tale offered by years of vicious Republican infighting, Democrats are dangerously close to entering into their own fratricidal conflict. On matters of both style and substance, the fractures within this freshman class are indicative of the broader divisions in a party long overdue for an ideological reckoning.""

THE RULEBOOK: EVERYTHING'S BUILT ON TRUST

""In republics, persons elevated from the mass of the community, by the suffrages of their fellow-citizens, to stations of great pre-eminence and power, may find compensations for betraying their trust, which, to any but minds animated and guided by superior virtue, may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in the common stock, and to overbalance the obligations of duty."" - Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 22

TIME OUT: SPORTS BOOKS

This week's ""Book Briefing,"" a weekly guide to books from the Atlantic: ""In the world of professional baseball, which is in the midst of spring training, the pressure is on for the player atop the mound. The former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Rick Ankiel brings you with him as he relives the one wild pitch that forever changed his life in The Phenomenon. But what is the perfect pitch? Terry McDermott's Off Speed looks to the Seattle Mariners pitcher F√©lix Hern√°ndez's perfect game, on August 15, 2012, for clues. According to Rowan Ricardo Phillips's The Circuit, the 2017 tennis season was one of unmet expectations. ... Unlike team sports, marathon running requires the mental and physical work of just one individual.

BIDEN STAFFING UP WITH KEY LATINO OUTREACH HIRE

Politico: ""In the latest sign that Joe Biden will run for president, his team has brought on Crist√≥bal Alex, the head of the influential Latino Victory Fund, according to a source familiar with the move. It's not clear what role Alex would fill in a Biden presidential campaign. He served as Hillary Clinton's National Deputy Director of Voter Outreach and Mobilization in 2016. Alex declined to comment but publicly disclosed on Tuesday that he was departing from Latino Victory Fund. He tweeted that he believes 'Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our nation. I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat him, and my next steps will reflect that.' The tweet sparked praise of Alex from many corners of the progressive world, including from Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and newly elected Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas).""

Warren targets Amazon, big tech - NYT: ""Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is bidding to be the policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary, announced another expansive idea on Friday: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook. The proposal -- which comes on the same day Ms. Warren will hold a rally in Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood that was to be home to a major new Amazon campus -- calls for the appointment of regulators who would 'unwind tech mergers that illegally undermine competition,' as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace. Ms. Warren's plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by technological giants, the campaign said, including Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's addition of Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Waze.""

Booker snags top S.C. hire - WVIC: ""Brady Quirk-Garvan, who has served as the Chairman of the Charleston County Democratic Party for five years, announced that he is stepping down in order to endorse Senator Cory Booker for President. With his announcement, Quirk-Garvan become the first South Carolina Democratic Party official to make an endorsement in the 2020 presidential nominating contest. ... Quirk-Garvan has worked on dozens of political races in South Carolina. In 2008, he worked for President Obama's campaign in Ohio. Since 2014, he has served as the Chairman of the Charleston County Democratic Party.""

Harris' crowd-pleasing tax rebate plan comes with a hefty price tag - San Francisco Chronicle: ""Even at this early stage in the presidential race, California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris has hit upon a crowd-pleasing proposal: Give a $500 monthly tax credit to families earning less than $100,000. But while it has become Harris' surest applause line at campaign appearances, some economists caution that it will never pencil out - that it will pile onto a national deficit that is already projected to top $1 trillion a year in the early 2020s and cost the economy more than 800,000 jobs.""

Gillibrand still lacks New York endorsements for 2020 - NYT: ""No one from New York's 21-member congressional delegation is yet backing [Kirsten Gillibrand's] bid for president. And neither is New York's governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, or its other senator, Chuck Schumer, who as minority leader is staying neutral because numerous senators are in the race. ... Home-state political insiders almost certainly will not prove decisive in a presidential primary race that begins in Iowa and New Hampshire. But Ms. Gillibrand's missing support back home is revealing of both her New York relationships and how she has constructed her national profile, often by staying far from the state's notoriously fractious and rough-and-tumble fray. In interviews with two-thirds of New York's Democratic congressional delegation, lawmakers this week offered a variety of rationales and dodges for why none of them has lined up behind their colleague.""

Buttigieg pitches court packing, ditching Electoral College - Fox News: ""Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg on Friday highlighted his push to add justices to the Supreme Court and scrap the Electoral College in presidential elections, as he campaigned in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. The South Bend, Indiana mayor ... said the 2020 election should not be about President Trump, telling reporters that 'of course we'll confront him, we'll call him out. We'll beat him. But at the end of the day, it's not about him, it's about us.' As he headlined 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics - a must stop for White House hopefuls - the 37-year old contender and Afghanistan war veteran joked that he's a 'young person with a funny name coming out of nowhere....I think it's safe to say I'm not extremely famous.'""

Moulton wants to run against Trump on National Security - Atlantic: ""The most that the Democratic presidential candidates tend to say about national security involves condemnation of Russia for hacking the 2016 election or broad comments about restoring America's standing in the world. Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts sees an opening. Some of the Democratic presidential candidates are running to the left. Some are running down the middle. Moulton told [journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere] he will run through VFW halls and college campuses, leaning in on a national-security focus which, even in a field this huge, he is all alone in focusing on -- a stance that not only differentiates him, but could eventually draw the others out on foreign affairs. Moulton is clearly a long shot... But his calculus -- and that of other more moderate, less well-known candidates -- is that the party is veering too far left for its own good in an election against Trump.""

Bullock hires veteran adviser to his PAC - Politico: ""Montana Gov. Steve Bullock has hired veteran Democratic operative Jenn Ridder to work for his PAC, in the latest sign that the Western Democrat is nearing a presidential run. Ridder will join Bullock's Big Sky Values PAC as a senior adviser, but she would be an obvious choice to manage Bullock's campaign should he decide to run for president. ... Ridder's hiring is the latest in a series of behind-the-scenes moves laying the groundwork for Bullock's potential run.""

Nevada Dems plan to bulk up caucuses - AP: ""Nevada Democrats are proposing changes to their presidential caucus that could dramatically alter the way candidates compete in the state, opening the process to an early-vote and virtual participation. The proposal would expand a single day of caucuses around the state to add four days of early caucuses and two days of early virtual caucusing. The plan, which still needs approval from the Democratic National Committee, would allow more people to participate while likely driving candidates to appear earlier and more often leading up to the main event on Feb. 22, 2020. It would also likely force candidates to invest more resources to more deeply organize and target voters.""

Iowa Poll alert - Des Moines Register: ""Results of a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll on Democratic presidential candidates headed toward the 2020 Iowa caucuses will be released online at 7 p.m. CST Saturday. The poll asks likely Democratic caucusgoers who their top choice for president would be among 21 potential candidates for their party's nomination. Results also will be aired by CNN, posted at CNN.com Saturday night and appear in the Des Moines Sunday Register. The poll will also test likely Democratic caucusgoers' opinions on a range of issues, from 'Medicare-for-all' to their interest in socialism to what they would like candidates to talk about during their campaigns.""

POLL SHOWS TRUMP IN TROUBLE WITH MICHIGAN VOTERS

Detroit Free Press: ""A new poll has more bad news for President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election hopes in Michigan, showing that more than half of those surveyed either plan to vote for someone else or are considering doing so next year. The poll, conducted by EPIC-MRA of Lansing, largely tracks with other recent polls done in Michigan and in some other states such as Wisconsin and Florida that show Trump could be in trouble some 20 months before the next election. ... Nearly half, 49 percent, of respondents in Michigan say they will definitely vote to replace Trump and another 16 percent say they will consider voting for someone else. Only 31 percent said they will definitely vote to re-elect Trump. Self-described independent voters are driving down Trump's numbers. Among independents, 44 percent say they will definitely vote for someone else and 27 percent say they will consider backing another candidate, while only 18 percent say they would definitely vote to re-elect.""

White house hustles to limit fallout from Trump emergency - WaPo: ""The White House is privately ramping up pressure on undecided Republicans to limit defections ahead of the Senate vote on President Trump's emergency declaration - even as the administration has yet to tell Congress which military projects would be tapped to pay for Trump's border wall. The vote expected next week is on a resolution to nullify Trump's Feb. 15 declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allows him to access $3.6 billion... Trump wants to use that money for border barriers, after Congress refused to give him all the wall funding he sought. In recent days, the White House has increased its efforts to count votes and persuade fence-sitting GOP senators... Undecided senators have received calls from the White House, and the message, according to one of the senators, is clear: Trump is taking names and noticing who opposes him -- particularly if you are running for reelection next year.""

Pentagon prepares to get money if need be - AP: ""The Pentagon is planning to tap $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall, a top Senate Democrat said Thursday. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told The Associated Press, 'It's coming out of military pay and pensions. $1 billion. That's the plan.' Durbin said the funds are available because Army recruitment is down and a voluntary early military retirement program is being underutilized. The development comes as Pentagon officials are seeking to minimize the amount of wall money that would come from military construction projects that are so cherished by lawmakers. ... Durbin, the top Democrat on the Appropriations panel for the Pentagon, was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Thursday morning.""

Good luck with that: Trump advisers urge him to stick to script - Politico: ""As he watches the 2020 Democratic candidates fire up campaign crowds, President Donald Trump is itching to upstage them with rallies of his own. ... For now, Trump's Republican allies and campaign officials believe an early reelection strategy built around his role as chief executive in dignified settings like the Oval Office and the Rose Garden will carry more weight with voters than his signature freewheeling arena speeches. It's unclear whether Trump, the most politically combative president in recent history, can truly stay above the campaign fray... But Trump's advisers are still hoping he will capitalize on his incumbency by largely sticking to official events and private, no-cameras fundraisers for the next several months, according to three sources familiar with his campaign, one of whom said the president is making a 'conscious effort' to rise above the Democratic scrum.""

"BEAUREGARD, Ala. - Head bowed, President Donald Trump paid respects Friday to the 23 people killed when a powerful tornado roared through a rural Alabama town, observing a moment of silence before white wooden crosses that stood in remembrance of each victim.

Trump and his wife, Melania, held hands as they paused in front of each of the markers erected near a church serving as a makeshift disaster relief center for survivors of Sunday's twister.

Earlier, the president stood on a hill overlooking a debris field and surveyed mangled trees and other wreckage.

Trump flew by airplane to a military base on the Georgia-Alabama border and boarded a helicopter that provided him with an aerial tour of the region before he arrived in Beauregard, which bore the brunt of the storm.

""We saw things that you wouldn't believe,"" Trump said after visiting a section of town where tornado winds tore houses from their foundations and uprooted trees. Mangled metal siding, wood planks and piping lay strewn on the ground, along with remnants of everyday life: items of clothing, a sofa, a bottle of Lysol cleaner and a welcome mat encrusted with dirt.

A local official had briefed Trump and the first lady as they stood outside a trailer belonging to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is assisting state and local response efforts.

He met with victims along the street, hearing their stories and dispensing hugs, in some case. He met privately with survivors and family members, including a woman mourning the loss of 10 relatives. ""What they've been through is incredible,"" Trump said after he emerged from the meeting.

At the relief center at Providence Baptist Church, Trump thanked law enforcement officials and other first responders, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who oversees FEMA.

""We couldn't get here fast enough,"" Trump said following the private church meeting.

""I wanted to come the day it happened,"" he said, adding that Gov. Kay Ivey had asked him to wait.

Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grader who has been volunteering there and signed the child's Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. Ingram said the president signed her sister's Bible as well. He signed other items, too, including cellphones.

Chats of ""USA!"" broke out as Trump prepared to depart the church. He visited the nearby crosses before heading for Air Force One.

The pastor, Rusty Sowell, said the president's visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.

""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" Sowell said.

Before Trump arrived in Beauregard, Renee Frazier stood amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother's home and waved as the helicopter carrying Trump passed overhead. Minutes before, Frazier had been arguing with relatives who opposed Trump's visit, calling it more about politics than compassion.

Frazier disagreed, saying, ""I want the president here to see what happened to my mom's house. I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity.""

Down the road, where several people died, Trump supporter Bobby Spann said he hoped the president learned ""how to be a Southerner and how to respect people"" during his brief visit.

Spann said he also hoped Trump realizes how much help is needed. The tornado had partially peeled away the roof of Spann's mobile home.

""Houses need to be replaced. You can't help the dead folks, but you can try to help the ones that's still living,"" said Spann, chewing on a yellowroot twig.

Trump has said he's instructed FEMA to give Alabama ""the A Plus treatment"" as it recovers. The tornado that struck Beauregard was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when 24 people were killed by a twister in Moore, Oklahoma.

The Alabama dead included four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family. Several people in Georgia were injured by twisters that also extended to Florida and South Carolina, according to the National Weather Service.

Alabama is politically friendly territory to Trump, whose response to natural disasters at times has seemed to be influenced by the level of political support he's received from the affected areas.

Alabama supported Trump by a wide margin in the 2016 presidential election, and he carried about 60 percent of the vote in Lee County, where Beauregard is located. Blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent sight in the town.

In the months after wildfires scorched California, a Democrat-led state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, Trump threatened to cut off federal aid unless the state embraced forest management policies he championed.

He also engaged in a sustained back-and-forth with lawmakers from hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico, whose pro-statehood governor identifies as a Democrat. Trump repeatedly blamed the U.S. territory for its problems and noted how much money recovery efforts had cost the federal government.

The administration at one point considered redirecting disaster aid from places like Puerto Rico and California to pay for the president's long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall but ultimately decided to target other funding sources.

""Exhibit A of how reporters distort words. I'm an Obama fan! I was saying how [President] Trump is different from Obama, and why we should focus on policy not politics,"" she tweeted, referring to an interview published earlier in the day by Politico Magazine.

She included a nearly two-minute recording of her interview. But the audio clip essentially confirmed that her quotes, though edited, were accurate.

In the interview, Omar ripped Obama, mocking the ex-president's ""pretty face"" and dismissing his agenda of hope and change as an illusion.

She cited the ""caging of kids"" at the Mexican border and the armed ""droning of countries around the world"" on Obama's watch -- and argued

that he wasn't much different from President Trump.

""We can't be only upset with Trump. His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies,"" the freshman firebrand told the outlet in a clear knock at the first African-American president. ""{They just were more polished than he was.

""And that's not what we should be looking for anymore. We don't want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished. We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile.""

"MANCHESTER, N.H. - Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg on Friday highlighted his push to add justices to the Supreme Court and scrap the Electoral College in presidential elections, as he campaigned in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.

The South Bend, Indiana mayor, who launched a presidential exploratory committee in January, said the 2020 election should not be about President Trump, telling reporters that ""of course we'll confront him, we'll call him out. We'll beat him. But at the end of the day, it's not about him, it's about us.""

SHINE MOVING FROM TRUMP WHITE HOUSE TO RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN

As he headlined ""Politics and Eggs"" at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics - a must stop for White House hopefuls - the 37-year old contender and Afghanistan war veteran joked that he's a ""young person with a funny name coming out of nowhere....I think it's safe to say I'm not extremely famous.""

Buttigieg highlighted that when it comes to his long shot bid for the Democratic nomination, a ""big part of the challenge for us is simply getting known.""

He spotlighted his call to scrap Electoral College and let the national popular vote determine the winner of a presidential election.

""I simply believe that every American ought to have the same vote, the same voice, no matter where you live, whether you're in a big city or small community, whether you're in a state like Indiana or a state like New Hampshire, that when it comes to choosing a president, everyone's vote should be strictly equal,"" he explained.

BIDEN TEAM QUIETLY GETTING READY FOR LIKELY 2020 LAUNCH

The push to scrap the Electoral College isn't a crowd pleaser in New Hampshire, a small general election battleground state with four electoral votes are always up for grabs.

Of course, the Granite State's most famous politically for holding the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, so Buttigieg was quick to highlight that ""I'm talking about the general election, not the primary calendar. I just wanted to make sure that's clear to everybody to my New Hampshire audience.""

Buttigieg spotlighted that ""the debate must begin"" on expanding the Supreme Court to prevent ""the perception of the court being a nakedly political institution.""

HOLDER SAYS DEMS SHOULD CONSIDER PACKING SUPREME COURT

He said the plan he finds ""most intriguing"" would expand the high court to 15 justices, with five appointed by a Democratic president, five by a GOP president, with the other five coming from the appellate bench and being seated only by the unanimous consent of the other ten.

""It just takes the politics out of it a little bit. Because we can't go on like this, where every time there's a vacancy, there's these games being played and then an apocalyptic ideological battle over who the appointee is going to be,"" he argued.

Asked by Fox News why he never mentioned Trump's name during his address and question and answer session with the audience, Buttigieg said ""the biggest message I have the current president is 'it's not about you.'""

""I just think that in addition to responding to current moment and the current president, we need to be talking about what the next era is going to look like. This president will come and go. This presidency will come and go,"" he said.

And he pushed back against criticism from Republicans that the Democratic Party has moved too far to the left with the ""Green New Deal"" and ""Medicare for All"" proposals, arguing labeling them as ""socialism"" won't be effective for the GOP going forward.

""I know that word's been used as a kill switch on debate over the years,"" he told Fox News.

""But now there's a new generation coming up who just want to know if ideas work or not. Most Americans are attracted to Medicare for All,"" he added. ""These are not wacky far left ideas.""

The Republican National Committee took aim at Buttigieg's long shot status, criticizing his mayoral record and claiming he's ""failing to stand out from the rest"" in a Democratic field that now stands at 14 contenders.

""With little-to-no support as other Democrats dominate the 2020 field, Buttigieg is desperate to gain traction with Granite Staters despite not having any major accomplishments to actually run on.,"" RNC Spokesperson Mandi Merritt said.

If Buttigieg pulls off a major upset and wins the Democratic nomination, he would become the first openly gay nominee of major political party. But he said it's not an issue on the campaign trail.

""It's been remarkable how many interviews and how many appearances, it really has been a non-issue. And that's historic too in its own way,"" he said. ""I also recognize that there's a historic quality to this potential candidacy and that it has the potential to make it just a little easier for the next person who comes along.""",465,Fox News,"Pete Buttigieg, longshot 2020 Dem, calls for packing SCOTUS, scrapping Electoral College"
"President Trump wasted no time Friday in attacking Democrats for their refusal to condemn Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for her anti-Semitic comments when the House passed a resolution condemning a broad range of bigotry.

The president clearly sees an opening to pick up votes of Jews - and non-Jews who support them and Israel - by portraying Republicans as their true friends. And the opening is indeed there.

By failing to specifically condemn Omar in the resolution and by failing to remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Democrats have not fulfilled their responsibility to take an unequivocal and tangible step to right Omar's anti-Semitic wrong.

REP. OMAR MUST UNDERSTAND GRAVITY OF HER NEW JOB, REPUBLICANS NEED TO STAY FOCUSED ON THEIR OWN CHALLENGES

As a result, Democrats risk permanently fracturing their party. And they risk increasing President Trump's chances of re-election and Republican chances of recapturing majority control of the House in the 2020 elections.

Support for Israel and opposition to anti-Semitism have long been bedrock positions of Democratic elected officials and candidates. But sadly, that support is eroding among far-left Democrats.

""The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party,"" President Trump told reporters at the White House. ""They've become an anti-Jewish party, and that's too bad.""

That's clearly an exaggeration by the president as he aims to erode what has traditionally been strong Jewish support for Democratic candidates.

""I thought yesterday's vote by the House was disgraceful,"" Trump said, referring to the resolution passed on a 407-23 vote by the House that was originally crafted to condemn anti-Semitism in reaction to comments by Omar.

House Democratic leaders reworked the resolution before it came to a vote to also condemn prejudice against other groups. But the resolution doesn't mention Omar or her anti-Jewish and anti-Israel comments that prompted the measure.

Omar issued her latest anti-Semitic attack last week, claiming that American supporters of Israel perniciously ""push allegiance to a foreign country.""

Regrettably, Omar's latest comments are not new. They echo ones she made earlier last month trotting out an obvious anti-Semitic trope in which she suggested that Jewish interests buy off American politicians to increase support for Israel.

And back in 2012 Omar tweeted: ""Israel has hypnotized the world; may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."" Omar kept the tweet up throughout her 2018 House campaign and even after she was sworn into office, only deleting it just a few weeks ago without comment.

Given these developments, I'm afraid we are beyond the point of simply suggesting Omar's anti-Semitic remarks and apparent beliefs are unbecoming for a member of Congress and deserve condemnation.

Sufficiently responding to Omar's rhetoric requires more than a symbolic floor vote and absolutely demands her removal from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which exercises oversight of U.S. relations with countries around the world - including Israel. Bills dealing with U.S. aid to Israel fall under the committee's jurisdiction.

The deep division within the Democratic Party over this issue could not be more apparent than through the painstaking process needed to arrive at the language for the anti-hate resolution approved in the House.

I support the full-text of the final resolution. The measure not only emphasizes the issue raised by Omar - anti-Semitism and its shameful rise in modern America - but also condemns anti-Muslim bigotry and points out the insidiousness of historic accusations of dual loyalty against Jews, Muslims and Catholics.

However, the process by which House Democrats arrived at this final text reveals the deep and seemingly intractable divide that exists between the progressive-socialist and liberal-moderate wings of the party.

Specifically, it is deeply troubling that a previous resolution, which simply condemned anti-Semitism in no uncertain terms, was considered unacceptably controversial by the left-most factions within the Democratic Party.

Further, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. inserted herself in the middle of Omar's controversial remarks, unnecessarily elevating this issue, revealing party division, and even missing the mark on substance.

Ocasio-Cortez - a self-described socialist who attracts an extraordinary amount of media attention for a freshman - argued on Twitter that Omar should not receive a reprimand because Republican members of Congress have made biased comments of their own in the past without receiving condemnation.

In this case, it seems Ocasio-Cortez would rather discard former first lady Michelle Obama's beatifically succinct strategy of ""when they go low, we go high"" and turn the focus toward Republicans instead of reckoning with the bitter anti-Semitism among some in her own party.

Turning to the serious electoral impact of Omar's latest remarks, the growing momentum against Israel led by her and Ocasio-Cortez will have serious consequences for the Democratic Party - particularly because of their prominent and vexing national profiles.

After taking majority control of the House in January, Democrats must prove to voters that they can lead the nation forward and deserve to keep control of the House, win control of the Senate and take back the White House in the 2020 elections.

"The House passed a broad electoral-reform bill Friday, fulfilling a Democratic campaign promise from last year.

The For the People Act, or H.R. 1, which was sponsored by Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, passed the House 234-193 in a party-line vote.

The bill is Democrats' effort to combat corruption and dark money in elections and would overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court case, which lifted certain regulations on political spending by unions and corporations. It would also enable automatic voter registration, make Election Day a federal holiday, expand early voting, put independent commissions in charge of House redistricting, force ""dark money"" groups to disclose donors, and require presidential and vice presidential candidates to release ten years of tax returns to the public.

The bill will likely die in the Senate, where Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell has disparagingly called it the ""Democrat Politician Protection Act.""

""They're trying to clothe this power grab with cliches about 'restoring democracy' and doing it 'For the People,' but their proposal is simply a naked attempt to change the rules of American politics to benefit one party,"" McConnell wrote in the Washington Post in January.

Representation Rodney Davis of Illinois, the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee, which advanced the bill, complained that it was being rushed to a floor vote for ""political reasons instead of good policy.""

"The Los Angeles Times reports Avenatti filed for bankruptcy ahead of a scheduled appearance before a federal judge in California Friday, where he was expected to testify on Eagan Avenatti's financial situation. Jason Frank, an attorney and former partner in the firm, accused Avenatti of attempting to shield legal fees from creditors amid the company's bankruptcy proceedings.

""Who cares? Old firm that we have not operated under for a very long time,"" Avenatti said of the bankruptcy filing to the Times. ""We want to ensure the proper distribution of assets to creditors -- it means nothing to our current law practice. Onward and upward.""

The filing puts Avenatti's planned testimony on hold. An attorney for Frank said in a statement that Avenatti's testimony would have ""exposed"" the television lawyer's ""financial shenanigans.""

""That Mr. Avenatti would try something so desperate speaks volumes about how bad the evidence is against him,"" said attorney Eric George.

In May 2018, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Catherine Bauer ordered the law firm to pay Frank $10 million. Under a bankruptcy settlement, court documents show Avenatti agreed to pay the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $2.4 million in unpaid taxes, fines, and interest.

The development comes after Avenatti caught a legal break in connection to his November 2018 domestic violence arrest. Last month, the Los Angeles city attorney's office said the television lawyer will not face charges related to the arrest. An actress who alleged she had a relationship with Avenatti said that he dragged her across the floor of his Los Angeles apartment after an argument over money, court documents show.

"Donald and Melania Trump visit people in Lee County in eastern Alabama. Reuters

President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump flew to tornado-wracked eastern Alabama Friday to survey the damage from a deadly tornado that devastated a small town, killing nearly two dozen people.

The president toured rural Lee County in eastern Alabama, where 23 people died Sunday in a massive EF4 tornado that carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide with 170 mph winds.

Air Force One first landed at a military base along the Georgia border, where Trump boarded a chopper for an aerial tour of some of the damage.

He and Melania later arrived in Beauregard -- which took a direct hit -- to meet with survivors of the storm.

En route, the motorcade passed severely damaged homes and fallen trees and whole neighborhoods that had been destroyed.

At one empty lot all that was left of a home that had been there were broken pieces of metal, wood and scattered clothes.

It was one of at least 38 tornadoes confirmed to have touched down across the Southeast in a deadly weekend outbreak.

As he left Washington, Trump said he expected to meet with Gov. Kay Ivey and people who ""got hit very hard by the tornadoes."" He also planned to thank first responders.

Trump has said he's instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give Alabama ""the A Plus treatment"" as the state recovers.

The Beauregard tornado was the deadliest to hit the US since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.

The Alabama dead included four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family.

The area where the tornado struck is generally Trump country, as he carried about 60 percent of the Lee County vote in 2016, and blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent

sight in Beauregard.

Standing amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother's home, Renee Frazier waved at Trump's helicopter as it passed overhead during his aerial tour of the destruction.

Minutes before, she was arguing with relatives who opposed Trump's visit, calling it more about politics than compassion.

""I want the president here to see what happened to my mom's house,"" she said. ""I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity.""

"Pelosi says Democrats need to vote as one against GOP messaging

The House of Representatives on Friday approved a sweeping election reform bill that serves as the touchstone to the House Democratic agenda but has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns.

The so-called ""HR 1"" measure embraced by House Democrats aims to curb big money in politics, make it easier to vote and bolster election security. It institutes a public financing system for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns and makes Election Day a federal holiday.

HOUSE DEMS TARGET TRUMP TAX RETURNS AS PART OF LEAD-OFF ETHICS PACKAGE

The House approved the plan 234-193. But the measure is not expected to succeed in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the bill is dead on arrival.

The American Civil Liberties Union, in a recent letter to Congress, encouraged lawmakers to vote against the bill because of ""provisions that unconstitutionally impinge on the free speech rights of American citizens and public interest organizations.""

""They will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day,"" the ACLU wrote.

One concern of civil libertarians is the bill's inclusion of the DISCLOSE ACT, which would require all organizations that spend money on elections to disclose donors.

HOUSE PASSES BROAD RESOLUTION CALLING OUT RACISM, 'ANTI-SEMITIC' COMMENTS

The ACLU said it supports making organizations report spending for public communications like TV ads that expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it worries the DISCLOSE ACT goes beyond that.

""These standards are unclear and entirely subjective, which will lead to confusion and, ultimately, less speech,"" the ACLU said.

Republicans called the bill a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections.

""Now, instead of getting money out of politics, the Democrats on this committee voted to pass a bill that will publicly fund - campaign travel, campaign dinners, and in some cases, the politicians themselves,"" Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis wrote in an op-ed for The Hill.

The White House said in a statement that the Democrats' plan would ""micromanage"" elections that now are run largely by states and would establish ""costly and unnecessary program to finance political campaigns.""

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill ""restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest, the people's interest, not the special interests.""

Trying to turn Republicans' words against them, Pelosi said, ""Yes it is a power grab -- a power grab on behalf of the people.""

House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California said the legislation would undermine the integrity of elections by allowing convicted felons to vote, and would apply a one-size-fits-all standard to elections now run by states and local governments.

Democrats called that a mischaracterization.

To Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the bill ""grabs power away from the elites and the power brokers and gives it to the people.""

She and other Democrats disputed the claim that taxpayers will pay for campaigns, noting that money for political campaigns would come from a surcharge on federal settlements made with banks and corporations that run afoul of the law.",471,Fox News,"House approves sweeping Dem election reform bill, amid First Amendment concerns"
"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been panned for making some less than empowering statements about women during an International Women's Day address on Friday.

During his speech to mark the day at the Chamber of Minerals and Energy in Western Australia, Morrison insisted that women's rights should be ""accelerated"" in the country but not at the expense of the success of others.

""See, we're not about setting Australians against each other, trying to push some down to lift others up,"" he said. ""We want to see women rise. But we don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse.""

He also discussed his desire for his two daughters to have ""all the choices in life you would want them to have,"" but emphasized the need for the nation's economy to be strong in order for women to have those opportunities, The Guardian reports.

""We want everybody to do better, and we want to see the rise of women in this country be accelerated to ensure that their overall place is maintained,"" he continued. ""That is an absolutely liberal value, that you don't push some people down to lift some people up. And that is true about gender equality too.""

AUSTRALIA BLAMES STATE ACTOR FOR HACKING POLITICAL PARTIES

His speech drew quick criticism, including Sarah Hanson-Young, Senator to South Australia.

The Labor Party's deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said in response that gender equality is ""good for both women and men"".

""It gives all of us more freedom and choice at work, at home, and in our relationships,"" she said in a statement. ""Feminism is a fight for equality between men and women, what's so complicated about that?"" She also took to Twitter to address the Prime Minister's statements, asking, ""Could Scott Morrison be any more out of touch?""

After his speech, which drew criticism, Morrison wrote on Twitter that International Women's Day should be a celebration all that women have accomplished in Australia.

""Today is about appreciating all the women in our lives and our nation -- celebrating their value and achievements,"" he said.

The Liberal Party in Australia has long been criticized for its lack in diversity, something its minister of women Kelly O'Dwyer was forced to address on Friday as well. Just 21 percent of their federal parliamentarians are women, compared to 42 percent of the Labor's total number. The National party is reportedly comprised of just 14% female parliamentarians.

""I think it's fair to say in terms of representation in parliament we can do better - I'm not going to deny that,"" O'Dwyer said.

"The intersectional Left just served notice that it, and not Nancy Pelosi, is in charge of the party.

It turns out you can accuse Jews of controlling the world, buying Congress, and harboring dual loyalty to Israel and still be considered a heroine by much of the Democratic party. The reaction to the latest example of anti-Semitic invective from Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) is a teaching moment for anyone previously unsure about how the toxic mix of identity politics, intersectional ideology, and naked partisanship could lead to a major American political party deciding that hatemongering from one of its members wasn't deserving even of a slap on the wrist.

A week's worth of national discussion over Omar's anti-Semitic remarks didn't result in her condemnation by the House. To the contrary, the House majority revealed itself to be deeply divided on the question of how to handle blatant anti-Semitism. The ""compromise"" Democrats finally agreed upon was a resolution that not only lumped in the question of the moment -- the effort by one member of Congress to delegitimize Jews and supporters of Israel -- with a laundry list of other hatreds. And they failed to single out Omar for her actions.

The result is an odd echo of those who criticized the Black Lives Matter movement by claiming that ""all lives mattered,"" a stand that was harshly criticized at the time by most liberals and Democrats as insensitive to -- if not evidence of -- racial bigotry. It is a stance they appear to have no shame echoing when it comes to anti-Semitism.

Indeed, Omar has emerged from this incident not only unscathed but also confident that many in the House, and several Democratic presidential candidates, consider her the aggrieved party in the discussion. With so many Democrats agreeing that Omar had been unfairly singled out because of her race and religion, that leaves Jews, one of the most loyal constituencies of the Democratic party, pondering the speed with which they had been discarded.

Jews and supporters of Israel are not the only losers in this incident. House speaker Nancy Pelosi made it clear to Omar a month ago that expressions of anti-Semitism would not be tolerated and forced the congresswoman to issue a contrite apology claiming, as she had done after a previous anti-Semitic statement, that she was unaware of the hurtful nature of singling out Jews for demonization.

That this exercise was blatantly insincere was evident not only from the wording of the apology but also because of Omar's open support of the BDS -- boycott, divestment, sanctions -- movement against Israel which routinely traffics in anti-Semitism. Far from seeking a more open conversation on the Middle East or the U.S.-Israel alliance, the goal of Omar and fellow BDS supporter Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) is to isolate the one Jewish state on the planet.

But after Omar's more recent statement in which she accused ""Jewish colleagues"" of seeking to discriminate against her and Tlaib because they were Muslims and asking Americans ""to swear allegiance"" to Israel, there will not be even an insincere apology. Instead, it was Pelosi who backed down after the vote, lamely claiming again that Omar didn't mean to be anti-Semitic, as if the events of the last month that proved the contrary had never happened.

How is this possible?

Many on the left believe that as a woman of color, a Muslim, and an immigrant, Omar cannot, by definition, be a purveyor of hate and prejudice. One way that identity politics manifests is that those who are considered oppressed receive immunity to do things that those considered more privileged cannot do. Hence many Democrats, particularly members of the Congressional Black Caucus, sought to defend Omar rather than to disavow her.

Just as important is the way intersectional theory -- which, taking its cues from critical-race theorist Kimberl√© Crenshaw, seeks to connect the struggle of all allegedly oppressed peoples -- serves to legitimate anti-Semitism. For many on the left, the Palestinian war to destroy Israel is falsely linked to the struggle for civil rights in the United States. Not only does that cause them to ignore the complicated truth about the conflict in the Middle East, it also justifies BDS campaigns and efforts to demonize those who support Israel.

Pelosi and other mainstream Democrats have long accused Republicans of trying to use their ardent support for Israel as a wedge issue and thereby damaging bipartisan support for the Jewish state. What they failed to realize is that much of their party no longer wants any part of that consensus. Three of the party's leading presidential candidates -- Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris -- all issued statements in support of Omar, even registering concern about her safety.

While Pelosi and other mainstream Democrats are hoping the House resolution will end the controversy, one suspects that it is only the beginning of the effort to chip away at support for Israel and to legitimate anti-Jewish tropes in the process. Omar is now armed with the knowledge that she has the support of a large portion of the Democratic party, and will likely continue to snipe away at both Jewish members of Congress and AIPAC. The line that used to exist between legitimate debate about the Middle East and anti-Semitic invective has been blurred by this incident. It may yet disappear if Democrats come to believe that there is no use trying to restrain radicals who now feel empowered to slander Israel's supporters with impunity. The Left has served notice to Pelosi that they are in charge now, not her.

This may not hurt Democrats at the voting booths. But the idea that Jews have a secure home in the Democratic party has been exposed as an illusion. The Left hasn't merely captured the Democratic party -- it has transformed it.",473,nationalreview.com,The Democratic Surrender on Anti-Semitism | National Review
"Dutch author and sociologist Ruud Koopmans said this week that Muslims are more difficult to integrate into Western society than other migrant groups because of a literal interpretation of the Quran prevalent among Muslims.

Ruud Koopmans, professor at the Berlin Social Science Center and author of several books including Contested Citizenship: Immigration and Cultural Diversity in Europe, told the Danish newspaper Berlingske that whereas most groups of migrants integrate relatively quickly, especially from one generation to the next, Islam stands out as an exception.

""Although it's not completely absent in Muslims, the change is much slower,"" he said, noting that a literal interpretation of the Quran prevents them from integrating into Western countries.

In an earlier published study titled ""Fundamentalism and out-group hostility,"" Koopmans compared Muslim radicalism with Christian radicalism to better understand why Islam stands out for its isolationism.

""Almost 60 percent agree that Muslims should return to the roots of Islam,"" he wrote, while ""75 percent think there is only one interpretation of the Qur'an possible to which every Muslim should stick.""

Koopmans, who has been studying Islam for over twenty years, also found that ""65 percent say that religious rules are more important to them than the laws of the country in which they live.""

Regarding Christian citizens on the other hand, Koopmans found that fewer than 4 percent ""can be characterized as consistent fundamentalists.""

""I conclude that the Islamic world is lagging behind rest of the world when it comes to democracy, human rights, and political and economic development,"" Koopmans told Berlingske in his interview this week.

""The main problem is how many Muslims and, globally, how many Muslim countries interpret Islam. Namely, in a way that basically claims that the Qur'an and the Sunna must be taken literally, and that the way the Prophet lived in the 7th century must be the yardstick for how Muslims should live in the 21st century,"" he said.

""Such a brand of Islam is, firstly, a threat to world peace. Secondly, it prevents integration,"" Koopmans concluded.

Although it is politically taboo to draw distinctions between ethnic groups when it comes to immigration, some scholars, including Pope Benedict XVI, have urged the West not to assume that all cultures share its basic suppositions about the human person and society.

Prior to his election as pope, Joseph Ratzinger wrote that ""the interplay of society, politics, and religion has a completely different structure in Islam"" than it does in the West.

Unfortunately, he added, much of today's discussion in the West regarding Islam ""presupposes that all religions have basically the same structure, that they all fit into a democratic system with its regulations and the possibilities provided by these regulations.""

""The Koran is a total religious law, which regulates the whole of political and social life and insists that the whole order of life be Islamic,"" Ratzinger wrote. ""Sharia shapes society from beginning to end. In this sense, it can exploit such partial freedoms as our constitution gives, but it can't be its final goal to say: Yes, now we too area body with rights, now we are present just like the Catholics and the Protestants.""

""With the rise of anti-Semitism in this country, is it more important to defend party politics, or is it more important to defend anti-Semitism?"" said, referring to the Minnesota Democrat.

""We can have conversations all day long about how you feel about Palestinian politics, Israeli politics, how you feel about (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu. ... I just present this question, which may be an uncomfortable one: If what Ilhan Omar has been saying for the past few weeks were said by a white Republican male, how would you be reacting to it right now?""

McCain later choked up when she mentioned former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who is an Orthodox Jew, calling the couple her ""family.""

""On both sides it should be called out,"" she said about hate crimes in the US.

""And just because I don't technically have Jewish family that are blood-related to me doesn't mean that I don't take this as seriously, and it is very dangerous, very dangerous. ... What Ilhan Omar is saying is very scary to me,"" she said.

""And it's very scary to a lot of people, and I don't think you have to be Jewish to recognize that.""

But Omar defiantly lashed back by retweeting a post by Medhi Hasan, an ""Intercept"" columnist and Al Jazeera host, just hours after the House voted in favor of an anti-hate resolution that was initially inspired by the Somali-born lawmaker's anti-Semitic comments.

""Meghan's late father literally sang 'bomb bomb bomb Iran' and insisted on referring to his Vietnamese captors as 'g -- ks,"" Hasan wrote, referring to the Arizona senator who died in August at age 81.

""He also, lest we forget, gave the world Sarah Palin. So a little less faux outrage over a former refugee-turned-freshman-representative pls.""",475,New York Post,Ilhan Omar retweets Al Jazeera host to respond to Meghan McCain
"Turner Classic Movies just premiered a month-long series, Journalism in the Movies, but its ballyhoo has a truth-in-advertising problem. Promos for the 21 films being shown promise ""to defend Democracy"" and to ""dispatch facts, not fiction. What drives us? The truth!"" These Hollywood fantasies made during the 1930s through the 1970s cover the hacking trade, from newspaper to television, from All the President's Men on up. But TCM's celebration comes at the wrong time.

Journalism is now at its least trustworthy. It has entered a new phase of Yellow Journalism, which one broadcaster aptly characterized: ""All restraints are coming off now; it's no accident that public opinion of media is at its lowest point.""

Despite such widespread disapproval, TCM positions its regular anchor Ben Mankiewicz as a hardnosed cheerleader. Hailing from a family of Hollywood Democrats and the son of Frank Mankiewicz, press secretary for Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign, the host boasts about his favorite films in the series: Citizen Kane (co-written by Mankiewicz's uncle Herman Mankiewicz), All the President's Men, Sweet Smell of Success, Ace in the Hole, His Girl Friday. TCM's programming includes interview presentations with famously liberal CNN mouthpieces Anderson Cooper and Carl Bernstein (former Washington Post mascot), who routinely use TV face time to proclaim their partisanship.

By avoiding any alternative or original perspective on journalism or movies (no Mollie Hemingway, Pete Hegseth, or James O'Keefe permitted), TCM reveals its liberal bias. Democratic-party media wonks officiate as if that's all there is to contemporary journalism. Na√Øve film lovers might be especially susceptible to this partiality, believing it was normal -- or Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Fritz Lang's 1956 thriller that anticipates Norman Mailer's New Journalism).

Divided into sections -- ""Journalism and Politics,"" ""Newspaper Noir,"" ""TV News,"" ""Newspaper Comedies,"" ""Reporters at War,"" ""N.Y. vs. L.A."" -- Mankiewicz's beloved journo films promote professional cynicism. There's gossip (Sweet Smell of Success); skullduggery (Ace in the Hole); unnamed sources (All the President's Men); inappropriate workplace sexuality (His Girl Friday); and the megalomania (Citizen Kane) that's applicable to moguls from William Randolph Hearst to Jeff Bezos. But you must figure that out yourself, and given the age of these films, it's a distant alarm that fails to address the modern habits that force the public to be wary of media agendas: The way opinion is now presented over facts and editorializing replaces reporting indicates institutional self-infatuation. There's a reason the term ""fake news"" has taken hold, and Hollywood is partly to blame.

***

In Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's classic 1920s newspaper comedy The Front Page, the unscrupulous editor Walter Burns declares that ""there's an unseen hand that watches over newspapers."" This kind of self-mythologizing has ruled the newspaper genre and even infected the attitude of hero-worshiping readers who regard papers of record with religious authority. Our vainglorious media's thin-skinned reactions to the ""fake news"" charge shows in the abiding affection for the hardboiled yet self-aggrandizing The Front Page and made it adaptable to changing times -- it was first filmed in 1931, then 1975, with sex-role-reversal adaptations filmed in 1940 and 1988.

At its beginning, Hollywood's newspaper genre was personified by the whippersnapper nerve of bantam 1930s reporter icon Lee Tracy, whose only Oscar nomination came decades later, ironically for playing a dying U.S. president in The Best Man. Tracy, the cocky herald of an openly indecent profession now commanded by self-proclaimed sophisticates, is suspiciously absent from this series. TCM shows journalistic wrongdoing only as an aberration rather than the psychotic norm it has become. Its programming concept cannot escape the professional-class narcissism that is always with us.

After Robert Redford (Lee Tracy's temperamental opposite) enshrined himself as Watergate reporter Bob Woodward in All the President's Men, then informed the New York Times of the Pentagon Papers in Three Days of a Condor, he directed Lions for Lambs, using the Iraq War to expose journalistic duplicity through a reporter played by Meryl Streep (who later showed her true bias by deifying Washington Post owner Katharine Graham in The Post). Redford then revived ""Woodstein"" egotism by sentimentalizing disgraced newscaster Dan Rather's shameless narcissistic posturing with Cate Blanchett as his CBS producer in Truth.

Given this evolution, journalism as depicted in Hollywood (much as in real life) no longer simply provides news; it has brazenly shifted its mission from objectivity to advocacy. We no longer have stalwart Humphrey Bogart in Deadline U.S.A. but arrogant Tom Hanks in The Post and sanctimonious Mark Ruffalo in Spotlight -- portrayals that promote the #resistance media combine. A character like Sally Field's egoistic careerist in Absence of Malice would be inconceivable in today's Hollywood.

TCM's nostalgia is stealth activism; Hollywood's liberal drift is emphasized while journalism's craven ruthlessness -- Nathanael West's shocking point in the newspaper melodrama Miss Lonelyhearts (1958) -- is ignored, just like the contemporary outrages of newspapers and media outlets that operate as partisan platforms.

The mainstream media have misled the public by championing political bias, often hiding sources of information for their own benefit. Today's covey of mainstream journalists don't follow a code, but they all hold hive-mind political perspectives, and they command the same status, prominence, and wealth that high-profile journalists always have. The history of journalism in film is based in narcissistic opportunism, and the difference between the media and the public comes down to a class war. It goes back to ex-newsman and novice screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz's famous 1926 telegram beckoning newsman Ben Hecht to Hollywood: ""Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots!""

Some of the TCM offerings may be casually enjoyed, but critical thinking exposes fundamental cracks in the genre: TCM promotes only the profession's trickster moralism and its delusion of modern knight's gallantry. Since journalists have become incapable of fairness, this series is difficult to watch; its nostalgia is unhelpful, starting with the most disingenuous and lugubrious of all journalism movies, All the President's Men. (The damnable film, which inspired generations of wannabe investigative reporters and led to the disaster of adversarial journalism, deserves a separate essay.)

Will celebrating journalism in the movies during the era of fake news inspire self-reflection from either Hollywood or the press, or accountability to the public? Or will TCM turn America's most cynically abused readership into equally cynical sycophants?",476,nationalreview.com,Journalism in the Movies Cheers On Cynicism | National Review
"Vis-√†-vis China, the U.S. Navy and Defense Department could learn from a U.S.-Soviet agreement during the Cold War.

The U.S. Navy's Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) -- maneuvers that challenge excessive maritime claims and demonstrate America's commitment to freedom of the seas -- in the South China Sea have received a lot of press coverage over the last few months, most notably after a Chinese destroyer nearly collided with the USS Decatur last October. U.S. FONOPs have drawn the ire of Chinese officials -- one Chinese senior colonel suggested ramming U.S. ships conducting FONOPs. Yet these operations, and the unhappy response they've received, are nothing new in the recent history of great-power competition. As David F. Winkler documents in his book Incidents at Sea, one need look no further back than the 1980s, when the United States and the Soviet Union sparred over the same issue. A review of that history offers several lessons the United States can apply to its relations with China today.

The 1980s saw elevated naval tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. This was partly due to an expansion of the Soviet navy's operations in the eastern Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf, which brought Soviet and American ships into more frequent contact. The two countries held conflicting views on maritime rights, and each took steps to enforce its own position. President Carter initiated an aggressive FONOPs program in 1979 to defend navigation rights on the high seas and challenge excessive territorial claims, and three years later the USSR responded with navigation laws that refused to recognize any right of innocent passage through its territorial waters in the Black Sea.

The increased operational proximity between the two navies, coupled with the U.S. Navy's annual execution of 35 to 40 FONOPs, led to several high-profile incidents during the decade. These included ship collisions as well as the firing of flares and warning shots at U.S. ships by the Soviets. Tensions rose to a point where the U.S. warned its commanders not to provoke the Soviets, though in a secret message it instructed them to show neither ""timidity or deference"" in the face of aggression. Then, during the final days of the Cold War, the Soviet response to FONOPs took a more hostile turn. In January 1988, a Soviet admiral declared the United States' FONOPs illegal, adding that ""any foreign ships violating our sovereignty in the future should be destroyed."" The following month, two Soviet ships acted on his statement by intentionally colliding with the USS Yorktown and the USS Caron in the Black Sea after verbal warnings were ignored.

That these incidents did not spiral further out of control can be attributed at least in part to an agreement that the United States and the USSR signed following a spate of at-sea incidents during the late 1960s. The Incidents at Sea Agreement (INCSEA) served as a confidence-building measure between the two countries. It instituted guidelines for the American and Soviet navies to follow when operating near each other, provided an advanced-notification mechanism for potentially dangerous operations, and established channels to ask clarifying questions. It also facilitated annual review meetings, where frank exchanges could take place. During the 1988 session, one Soviet admiral disclosed that the severe response to FONOPs, including the intentional collision, was directly tied to political pressures on the Soviet navy. INCSEA proved to be so effective that it remains in force between the United States and Russia today.

There are clear similarities between this history and the Chinese reaction to FONOPs today. As the number of ships and aircraft in the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) grows and its operational reach expands outside the western Pacific, the United States can expect more interactions with the Chinese navy. Given the United States' current program of FONOPs in the South China Sea, the operating environment between the U.S. Navy and the PLAN will increasingly resemble the one that existed between the United Sates and the USSR in the 1980s. And while this does not necessarily mean there will be a replay of Cold War ship collisions and at-sea incidents, recent statements from China's leadership and occasional aggressive actions of PLAN ships and aircraft in the South China Sea indicate that naval interactions between the U.S. and China are headed in that direction. The U.S. Navy must be ready for a re-occurrence.

Yet even as the Navy prepares to operate in an increasingly tense environment, the United States should not abandon confidence-building measures with China and the PLAN. China continues to engage with the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and was a signatory to the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) in 2014. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense and China's Ministry of Defense have already signed a ministry-to-ministry agreement, the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA), that is similar to INCSEA. Unfortunately, as Winkler points out, the agreement's consultation process remains at the mercy of politics, does not establish a direct navy-to-navy communications channel, and is simply too informal to address matters of real importance. Correcting these deficiencies should be a priority.

There are steps the Navy can take to achieve these goals. First, it should expect that the PLAN will take a more assertive posture in response to American FONOPs in the South China Sea, and that it will expand its operations outside the western Pacific. Naval commanders must be trained to react to a variety of potential antagonistic actions from PLAN ships and aircraft, including verbal warnings, aggressive maneuvering, intentional collisions, and overt threats such as warning shots. Second, the United States needs to recognize that FONOPs, and Chinese reactions to them, can lead to an increase in hostile rhetoric and more aggressive responses against units conducting those missions. Remaining flexible in the timing, execution, and publicity of FONOPs needs to be part of the deliberate planning process. Finally, the Department of Defense should push to have the MMCA re-signed as a government-to-government, executive-level agreement that mirrors the U.S.-Russia INCSEA. INCSEA proved its worth during the Cold War, and an updated MMCA has the potential to similarly ease U.S.-China tensions on the high seas.",477,nationalreview.com,Freedom of Navigation in an Era of Great-Power Competition | National Review
"Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the next Democratic president should look into expanding the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to counter Republicans' ""power-grabbing antics.""

Holder, who announced earlier this week that he won't run for president in 2020 -- despite months of speculation and frequent trips to early primary states -- spoke at Yale Law School on Thursday.

He told the crowd that if he was president, he would ""seriously consider adding two seats to the Supreme Court to make up for [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell's power-grabbing antics.""

Democrats should ""seriously consider adding two seats to the Supreme Court to make up for Mitch McConnell's power-grabbing antics.""

-- Eric Holder

2020 DEMS BEING URGED TO BACK PUSH TO PACK SUPREME COURT

Holder's comments came after being quizzed on how Democrats could translate their Trump-era aggressiveness into actual policies.

Historically, some presidents have floated the idea of expanding the nation's highest court, with Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt once attempting to add six additional seats. But FDR's plan was shot down by conservative members of his own party.

One questioner at Yale asked about Holder's rebuke of Michelle Obama's famous saying about ""going high"" and asked what the Democratic Party should do if Republicans lose the White House, Law&Crime reported.

A spokesperson for Holder confirmed the comments to the outlet, issuing a statement slamming Senate Republicans for disregarding ""historical precedent"" when it came to nominations to the high court.

""In response to a question, former Attorney General Holder said that given the unfairness, unprecedented obstruction, and disregard of historical precedent by Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans, when Democrats retake the majority they should consider expanding the Supreme Court to restore adherence to previously accepted norms for judicial nominations,"" Patrick Rodenbush said. ""He views this as a corrective.""

""When Democrats retake the majority they should consider expanding the Supreme Court to restore adherence to previously accepted norms for judicial nominations.""

-- Eric Holder spokesman Patrick Rodenbush

ERIC HOLDER REJECTS MICHELLE OBAMA'S CALL FOR CIVILITY: 'WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK 'EM'

Holder grabbed headlines last year after rejecting Obama's call for respect and instead urged Democrats to forget civility.

""It is time for us, as Democrats, to be as tough as they are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are,"" Holder said. ""Michelle always says -- I love her; she and my wife are like, really tight, which always scares me and Barack -- but Michelle always says, 'When they go low, we go high.' No. When they go low, we kick 'em.""

Holder's comments mark the first time a high-profile Democrat endorsed the idea of expanding the Supreme Court, a move that even progressive 2020 candidates remain skittish about.

A progressive group named ""Pack the Courts"" has been at the forefront of driving the conversation about the high court expansion, but so far only two 2020 candidates have come out as open to the idea.

U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said in January during a podcast that expanding the court or imposing term limits were ""interesting ideas.""

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who's also running for president, said people shouldn't dismiss the idea, adding that ""it's no more a shattering of norms than what's already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today.""

The progressive group, meanwhile, celebrated Holder's statements and urged presidential candidates to ""explain how they will restore democracy over the objections of a hostile and partisan Court"" in order to be ""taken seriously.""

""The Supreme Court dismantled the Voting Rights Act, allowed a flood of dark money to corrupt our politics, and permitted hyper-partisan gerrymandering to rig the system against voters,"" the group said in a statement.

""Because the Court has undermined the institutions of democracy, court packing is the only way to restore the integrity of the political system. Attorney General Holder's positive remarks about court packing today underscore the importance of judicial reform as the 2020 campaign kicks into high gear. To be taken seriously, presidential candidates must explain how they will restore democracy over the objections of a hostile and partisan Court.""",478,Fox News,"Channeling FDR, Eric Holder says Dems should consider packing Supreme Court to counter GOP 'power grab'"
"The politics of House Democrats' struggle with an anti-Semitism resolution

The anti-hate resolution approved by Congress sparked a clash of opinions between Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway and Georgetown Institute of Politics executive director Mo Elliethee on Thursday night's ""Special Report"" All-Star panel.

What was supposed to be a condemnation of anti-Semitism in reaction to controversial remarks by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, developed into a broad resolution that condemned all forms of hate. It passed with support from an overwhelming majority, although 23 Republicans opposed it because it didn't solely address anti-Semitism -- nor did it explicitly condemn Omar.

Elliethee began by condemning Omar's recent remarks and expressing that Omar should have been mentioned in the resolution. But he also defended the congresswoman, who has ""received a lot of hate"" in recent weeks, pointing to a West Virginia poster linking Omar to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

""To be able to take a strong stand against all forms of hate I think is a good thing and I think the Republicans who've been trying to make hay out of this have trapped themselves because every single 'no' vote, two dozen members of the House voted 'no,' they were all Republicans who are now all on record against a resolution condemning all hate,"" Elliethee told the panel.

Hemingway pushed back, calling Elliethee's assessment ""very unfair,"" and adding that many on Capitol Hill were hoping for an ""actual resolution"" condemning Omar's rhetoric, but that type of resolution ""didn't happen.""

""The rise of anti-Semitism is not something anybody should be thinking about what's good politically out of it because it is a really bad thing,"" Hemingway said. ""You're seeing a rise of anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party right now, but it's a problem that's happening globally.""

Meanwhile, Washington Examiner commentary writer Tom Rogan invoked British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his ""personal"" problem with anti-Semitism and raised the red flag that ""lines get blurred"" between discussing Israel policy and invoking anti-Semitic conspiracies pushed by progressive Democrats.",479,Fox News,'Rise of anti-Semitism' is no time to be playing politics: Mollie Hemingway
"REPUBLICANS BLAST DEMS' ANTI-SEMITISM RESOLUTION AS 'SHAM': After several days of infighting and a near-rebellion by rank-and-file Democrats, as well as a major last-minute revision, the House on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution that only indirectly condemns U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar's repeated 'anti-Semitic' and 'pernicious' comments -- without mentioning the Minnesota Democrat by name. But opposing Republicans blasted the measure as a ""watered down"" sham, saying Democrats wanted to avoid condemning one of their own.

The final vote was 407-23, with 23 Republicans voting no, and all Democrats, including Omar, voting yes. But the freshman congresswoman did not avoid another controversy for very long. Meghan McCain, co-host of ""The View"" had become emotional during the ABC talk show, discussing Omar's recent criticisms of Israel and its supporters. She said Omar's remarks were hurtful to many of her Jewish friends. But instead of responding directly to McCain, Omar retweeted a post that criticized McCain for ""faux outrage"" and referred to past statements attributed to McCain's late father, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who died last August at age 81.

MANAFORT LEARNS HIS FATE: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Thursday was sentenced to 47 months in prison after a federal jury in Virginia convicted him on eight counts of bank and tax fraud last year ... Manafort's conviction in August made him the first campaign associate of President Trump found guilty by a jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis emphasized ahead of sentencing that the Manafort case was not about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Manafort will receive credit for the nine months he's already served. Manafort was also hit with a $50,000 fine. Next week in Washington, D.C., Manafort is scheduled to face punishment in a separate illegal lobbying case, having pleaded guilty in that case in September.

JOBS REPORT PREVIEW: According to the new jobs report for February, due to be released Friday, U.S. employers extended their streak of hiring in February even as the overall economy showed signs of slowing, according to the Associated Press ... On Friday, the government is expected to report that the economy added 182,000 jobs last month, down from a blockbuster gain of 304,000 in January, according to data provider FactSet. Even such a smaller job gain, though, would be enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. The consensus forecast is that the jobless rate dipped to 3.9 percent last month from 4 percent in January. Slowing global growth, a trade war with China and signs of increased caution among consumers have led many economists to forecast weaker growth in the first three months of this year. Still, most analysts expect businesses to keep hiring and growth to rebound in the April-June quarter.

MICHAEL JACKSON'S DAUGHTER BREAKS HER SILENCE ON 'LEAVING NEVERLAND': Michael Jackson's daughter, Paris, weighed in Thursday on the allegations made against her father in the ""Leaving Neverland"" documentary ...

Paris Jackson's response came in a thread on Twitter, in which she wrote that ""injustices are frustrating."" But she encouraged others to instead try reacting calmly. In a follow-up tweet, she suggested that people should ""think about the bigger picture."" Michael Jackson died in 2009 at age 50.

"Hello from snowy and not-un-Siberia-like upstate New York, where I'm attending a conference at the Russian Orthodox monastery and seminary. At dinner last night with some conference-goers, I was talking about my ideas for my upcoming book. As you regular readers know, I plan to write about the warnings people living here who grew up under Soviet and Eastern European communism are now sounding about the emerging totalitarianism in our own increasingly post-liberal culture. Many of you weren't keen on me framing this as a recrudescent socialism, because I am talking mostly about culture, not political economy.

The thing is, socialism is not only about political economy. It's a way of seeing the world. One of my Orthodox professor friends here at the conference said that Dostoevsky, no aristocrat, understood this. I found this bit last night online, describing Dostoevsky's view on socialism:

The Rousseauistic view of human nature on which utopian socialism rested was severely challenged by Dostoevsky's experience of prison in Siberia. The theoretical notion of the fundamental goodness of human beings was now tested against the reality of human nature in the raw. The unrepentant brawlers, thieves, and murderers with whom he spent four years were not merely innocent victims who would happily live in brotherhood and harmony once freed from repressive institutions. Returning from ten years in Siberia Dostoevsky encountered a socialism that had taken on a much more revolutionary cast. His remarks about it in both fiction and journalism over the next two decades are almost uniformly hostile. The enmity -- largely theoretical -- between Christianity and the socialism of the late [Vissarion] Belinsky and his circle, had now become a reality, and this revolutionary and atheistic doctrine the major rival of Christianity for the hearts and minds of the new generation. Dostoevsky's critique of socialism, then, begins with its atheism. Dismissing the essential spiritual nature of human beings, the socialists can concern themselves only with man's material needs. As Dostoevsky wrote in his notebook for 1863-1864: 'The socialists want to regenerate humans, to liberate them, to present them without God and the family. They conclude that having forcibly changed the economic way humans live they will achieve their goals. But humans are transformed not from external reasons but only from moral changes.' In his notes for an unfinished article, 'Socialism and Christianity,' Dostoevsky wrote that 'the socialists go no further than the belly.' Lacking any spiritual basis for human brotherhood, the socialists must resort to compulsion to establish it. French socialism, he wrote in 1877, 'is nothing other than the compulsory union of humanity'; or, as he said, more vividly, about the slogan of Roman Catholicism, which he saw as sharing the goals of socialism, 'Fraternit√© ou la mort' ('Be my brother, or off with your head'). These two ideas -- that human problems can be solved by exclusively material remedies, but that this cannot be done without compulsion -- run through Dostoevsky's critique of socialism.

Point is, there really is a lot of ""socialism"" in Whatever This Thing We're Dealing With Is. Marxist modes of thought are great at tearing down what we have, but insofar as nobody really believes in the Revolution anymore, it doesn't offer much to replace it. The political theorist Augusto Del Noce captured a key aspect of what we're dealing with now when he wrote: ""the new totalitarianism is very different from older forms because it is a totalitarianism of disintegration, even before being a totalitarianism of domination. It dominates by disintegrating.""

Still, I am persuaded by some recent offline conversations that framing it as socialism obscures more than it illuminates. Two points a friend made bring this out:

I find these points to be unanswerable. Maybe you disagree.

A reader sent me a link to Peggy Noonan's latest column (which is behind a paywall). She says that our condition in the US these days reminds her of China's Cultural Revolution, especially the ""struggle sessions"" in which fanatical young communists forced supposed enemies of the Revolution to confess their sins publicly (whether they were guilty or not). Noonan writes:

There's a feeling in the air, isn't there? We're all noticing pieces of the story here and there, in this incident and that. But maybe it has an overall meaning. And maybe that meaning isn't good.

Reading this, it hit me: I've had the wrong commies in mind! What the former anti-communist dissidents among us are recognizing is the totalitarianism inherent in a new Cultural Revolution, the contours of which we are only just now beginning to discern.

The book I'm going to write is about how to hold on through the Cultural Revolution now upon us. It shares many characteristics with hardline socialism, but it is also significantly different -- so much so that trying to pin it on socialism proper is problematic.

It is certainly the case that if our own American socialists came to power, they would implement the full panoply of identity politics leftism, though that wouldn't be their main priority. But Del Noce, again, is acutely correct when he points out that it's a mistake to think that totalitarianism requires a police state. It can exist even in democracies, he said, because totalitarianism is a condition in which politics invades all of life.

I wish you could see my e-mails or have the kinds of personal conversations I have with academics and people involved in public life. They make fairly mild statements critical of the woke, but ask me not to identify them. They're afraid. They see what happens to dissenters. A friend told me this week, ""You're lucky, in a way. You'll never be hired in a newsroom again, after the things you've written. You can say what you think.""

Yes, as long as there's a TAC (thank you, donors). But if I lost my job here? We don't have a state telling people not to hire the likes of me. We don't need one. Sixty percent of employers in this poll said they check the social media profiles of potential hires, and include what they find there in their decisions. You think China is the only country with a social credit system?

A friend in DC told me this week that he was recently at a dinner party where one of the other guests said to him, ""Growing up in the Soviet Union, my parents taught me never to believe a thing I heard in the media, and to be very careful what I say out loud. Now I find myself telling my children the same thing.""

That's our country. That's our Cultural Revolution. That's the framing for this next book. It's eventually going to burn itself out (I hope), but not for a long time, and not before doing a hell of a lot of damage. Our task is to fight it openly where we can, but to build up resistance in ourselves and in our communities. Almost one year ago, to the day, I spent one of the most important evenings of my life with the Benda family in Prague. Here's my account of what I learned there. The most important lesson: the same strategies that the Bendas used to endure communism without losing their minds or their souls are keeping them solidly grounded in their faith and traditions in their post-communist capitalist society, which is the most atheist in Europe.

Those people know how to live. They have wisdom for us. So do others who came through communism. They can help us beat the Cultural Revolution.",481,The American Conservative,Beating The Cultural Revolution
"Hoover Institution senior fellow and author Victor Davis Hanson breaks down how President Trump won in 2016 and continues to win against the media and D.C. establishment.

In some sense, Donald Trump was replaying the role of the unpopular tenure of loudmouth Democrat Harry Truman (president, 1945-53). ""Give 'em Hell"" Harry came into office following the death of Franklin Roosevelt. He miraculously won the 1948 election against all expert opinion and polls. Truman left office in January 1953 widely hated. Indeed, his final approval ratings (32 percent) were the lowest of any departing president, except for those of Richard Nixon.

The outsider Truman had always been immersed in scandal, owing to his deep ties to the corrupt Kansas City political machine, and Truman's patron, the unsavory boss Tom Pendergast. When the novice Vice President Truman took office after Roosevelt's death in April 1945, he knew little about the grand strategy of World War II - and nothing about the ongoing atomic bomb project. For the next seven-plus years, Truman shocked - and successfully led - the country.

Over the objections of many in his cabinet, Truman ignored critics and ordered the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan to end the war. Against the advice of most of the State Department, he recognized the new state of Israel. He offended Roosevelt holdovers by breaking with wartime ally the Soviet Union and chartering the foundations of Cold War communist containment. Many in the Pentagon opposed his racial integration of the armed forces. National security advisors counseled against sending troops to save South Korea.

THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS GOING GANGBUSTERS (AND EVEN LIBERAL ECONOMISTS ARE STARTING TO ADMIT IT)

Liberals opposed fellow Democrat Truman's creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Truman was widely loathed for firing controversial five-star general and American hero Douglas MacArthur. There were often widespread calls in the press for Truman to resign. Impeachment was often mentioned. Truman, in short, did things other presidents had not dared to do.

Truman occasionally swore. He had nightly drinks. He played poker with cronies. And he shocked aides and the public with his vulgarity and crass attacks on political enemies. Truman cheaply compared 1948 presidential opponent Thomas Dewey to Hitler, and attacked him as a supposed pawn of bigots and war profiteers. Truman hyperbolically claimed a Republican victory in 1948 would threaten America's very liberty.

In the pre-Twitter age, Truman could never keep his mouth shut: ""My choice early in life was either to be a piano-player in a w****house or a politician. And to tell the truth, there's hardly any difference."" When a reviewer for the Washington Post trashed Truman's daughter's concert performance, Truman threatened him with physical violence. ""It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful,"" Truman wrote in a letter to critic Paul Hume. ""Someday I hope to meet you. When that happens, you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!"" Such outbursts were Trumpian to the core.

Truman trashed national icons, in a way that often exceeded Trump's smears. He deprecated the military leaders who had just won World War II. He was childishly vulgar in his dismissal of MacArthur: ""I didn't fire him because he was a dumb son of a b**** although he was, but that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to three-quarters of them would be in jail."" The latter was an astounding charge in an age of Bradley, Eisenhower, LeMay, Patton, and Ridgway, and admirals such as Halsey, King, Nimitz, and Spruance.

It took a half-century for historians to concede that the mercurial and often adolescent Truman had solid accomplishments, especially in foreign affairs - in part because Truman conveyed a sense that he did not much care for staying in Washington, a city in which he was not invested, did not like, and would quickly leave at the end of his tenure. Even Truman's crassness eventually was appreciated as integral to his image of a ""plain speaking"" and ""the Buck Stops Here"" decisive leader.

Had Truman access to Twitter, or had he a Kansas City federal prosecutor to hound him for his checkered past, he could have self-destructed in a flurry of ad hominem electronic outbursts. Yet Truman proved largely successful because of what he did, and in spite of what he said.

It is (perhaps regrettably) not evident that personal sins equate to failed presidencies. Character lapses are certainly not to be encouraged, but in the Machiavellian landscape of global politics they do not preclude wise leadership either.

Values are absolute and transcend time and place. But the notion of public versus personal, and private sin versus public guilt, changes constantly. In the past, pragmatism guided us about sin and politicians: a man's demons were his own unless they reached a point of impairing his public career or shaming his office in the eyes of the public. Two nightly martinis at home were okay. Four to five at a restaurant would inevitably become a matter of public concern.

""Damn"" in public was tolerated within limits, the F-word never was. Visiting a mistress was regrettable. But, then, who knew the possible private incompatibility or unhappiness within anyone's marriage? In contrast, sexually cavorting in the Oval Office was inexcusable. Private adultery was a matter of guilt to be judged by God. Sex in the workplace was shameful and to be condemned by the living.

One of the great ironies of our age is that we have somehow managed to become far more sanctimonious than previous generations - and yet far more immoral by traditional standards as well. We can obsess over an unartful presidential comment, but snore through the systematic destruction of the manufacturing basis of an entire state or ignore warlike violence on the streets of Chicago.

Trump's presidency is too brief to yet be judged absolutely. His personal foibles are too embedded within current political and media hatred to be assessed dispassionately. Too many assessments too quickly have been made about Trump, without much historical context and usually with too much passion.

Neither is it yet clear that Trump is a bad man or a good president, or vice versa, or neither or both. But if the past is sometimes a guide to the present, Trump in theory certainly could become a more effective president than would have been his likely more circumspect Republican primary rivals, while perhaps demonstrating that he is far more uncouth. The paradox again raises the question, when any one man can change the lives of 330 million, what exactly is presidential morality after all - private and personal sins, or the transgressions that affect millions of lives for the worse?",482,Fox News,"Victor Davis Hanson: Trump, Truman and the paradox of presidential morality"
"Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson says Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not have the votes in the House to override a veto from the president on a bill to stop the national emergency declaration.

The Senate has several choices to make with regard to the way it legislatively handles the president's emergency declaration for more border security funding.

First, it must decide whether or not there is an emergency at the southern border that warrants presidential action under The National Emergencies Act of 1976, or even more broadly, is in his inherent Constitutional power as president to address.

The president had said clearly that a crisis exists on the southern border that requires him to act immediately to secure it. Our porous borders have created a national emergency that victimizes migrants journeying to it and allows dangerous criminals and deadly drugs to flow across it. He has set forth the following facts in support:

BILLS BEFORE CONGRESS ARE TOO LONG AND COMPLICATED - TIME TO SHORTEN AND SIMPLIFY LEGISLATION

As a result of these facts, President Trump must take urgent action to address the crisis and uphold his duty to protect the safety of our nation. That must include building barriers. Nearly $8.1 billion has been identified to help secure the border, including funds appropriated by Congress, funds available under other statutory authorities, and military construction funds available under a national emergency. And last year, President Trump deployed the military to assist our heavily-strained border personnel with more than 5,000 troops.

If the members of the Senate agree that an emergency exists at the southern border, they must then decide how they will vote. Should they vote to accept the declaration? Or should they vote that, although an emergency exists, the president's declaration is an inappropriate use of The National Emergencies Act and his executive powers generally?

One thing is for sure: All 47 Democrats and Independents will vote against the president's use of emergency powers. That means Democrats will need at least four Republicans to join them for the resolution blocking the emergency declaration to pass. If that happens, the president will simply veto the bill, and the next question will be whether or not two-thirds of the House and Senate will vote to override the veto.

Historically, the odds are 90 percent that a veto will not successfully be overridden. Therefore, it is OK for some (but not too many) senators to go against the president. President Trump fully understands that some senators in vulnerable races need cover.

This is more about the politics of self-preservation than about constitutional overreach or the setting of a ""dangerous precedent.""

The veto must stand to allow the judiciary to weigh in. Republican Senators must not cave to pressure. It is imperative that the president and Republicans in Congress make good on their 2016 campaign promises to secure our southern border.

"U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., speaks in Washington, Feb. 25, 2019. (Associated Press)

U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is still trying to shore up endorsements from New York's congressional delegation ahead of a potential 2020 bid for the White House, leaving her the only senator in an already crowded Democratic field without any congressional backing from her home state.

""No one seems to be willing to stick their neck out for"" Gillibrand, Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic consultant, told Politico.

""No one seems to be willing to stick their neck out.""

-- Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic consultant

Though her campaign is still in its exploratory phase, Gillibrand is working to garner support with U.S. House members. The task could remain difficult as some may wish to see the field develop. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not closed the door on a run and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to travel to early caucus and primary states. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- a Democrat who has been both a Republican and an independent in the past -- recently announced he would not be running.

GILLIBRAND INTERRUPTED IN IOWA BY RESTAURANT PATRON SEEKING RANCH DRESSING

""She's working hard, she's been going into South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa,"" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., of the early primary states.

Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., said Cuomo could still be in play for a 2020 presidential bid, but that he is open to throwing his support to Gillibrand.

""It's too early to make any kind of decisive commitment without knowing the full lay of the land,"" Higgins told the politics website. ""It's early and there's seemingly new candidates coming in every single day.""

BLOOMBERG DINGS GREEN NEW DEAL AS HE TAKES HIMSELF OUT OF 2020 FRAY

Gillibrand's difficulty shoring up support is in contrast to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has the support of his state's Democratic delegation, as does Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has not received endorsements from most of her Democratic colleagues but has secured the support of five House members, according to Politico.

New York Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks told the site it was too early and that ""I don't know all the candidates yet. I'm going to wait to see who all of the candidates are.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to remain neutral in the 2020 primary. Some House members said privately that Gillibrand's relationships with New York Democrats aren't as strong as Schumer's.

""We see and deal with him a lot more,"" said one member, who told Politico they wished to remain anonymous.

""Just by virtue of how large and diverse the New York and California delegations are and how complicated their internal politics can be, it will be harder for any presidential candidate to lock them down,"" said Democratic strategist Craig Varoga. ""It's a credit to Booker that he could get New Jersey, but it's still easier to get New Jersey than California or New York -- those just aren't as realistic.""",484,Fox News,Gillibrand still lacks backing of home-state colleagues in Congress ahead of 2020 presidential race
"Democrats once again control the House, Nancy Pelosi is once again Speaker, and I, once again, feel as if I'm living in George Orwell's 1984, where war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.

How else to explain my feelings over the ""openness"" and ""transparency"" that will be enhanced by passage of H.R. 1, the Democrats' brazenly named ""For the People Act,"" which seeks to take legitimate, protected legislative speech and turn it into ""political"" speech subject to onerous and burdensome regulation?

Campaigns and PACs already must disclose every dollar raised and every dollar spent trying to influence the outcome of political campaigns. This ""political"" speech is already highly regulated. H.R. 1 is not going to make them disclose more, because they already disclose.

So, H.R. 1 is not going after ""money in politics,"" because we already disclose money in politics.

Instead, this bill is designed to intimidate, harass, and silence people for exercising their First Amendment rights on issues before the Congress. Exercising our First Amendment rights on issues is not - and should not be - considered political activity. That is free speech as defined in the First Amendment. It is speaking, assembling, and petitioning government for redress of grievances. That ""legislative"" speech, if you will, is protected and enshrined in the Bill of Rights.

I know firsthand why it must be protected, because of the IRS targeting of ""tea party"" and ""patriots"" groups that began in 2010. Sadly, I am not the first to understand and know why the freedom of association must be protected. The Supreme Court upheld it in 1958, when the state of Alabama was targeting members of the NAACP. It was wrong in the 1950s, it was wrong in the 2010s, and it will continue to be wrong in the future.

This suppression of speech is not unfamiliar in our country. It has happened many times. It is why the Founding Fathers protected the right to free speech to begin with. What happened to us is just a modern-day example of the chilling effect burdensome regulations have on free speech.

I've witnessed first-hand and at great pain what can come of ""donor disclosure,"" ""openness,"" and ""transparency"" - harassment, persecution, discrimination, and intimidation, for starters. Personal audits of donors to disfavored groups. Requests for lists of books and magazine articles read and discussed at meetings, demands even for the content of prayers offered.

And it's not just the content of the demands that are so offensive (though they truly are). It's the quantity of the demands. It's the use by the bureaucracy of their advantage in sheer manpower over citizen groups. Can you imagine how many thousands of man-hours were required to be devoted to filling out forms in response to those demands? I don't have to imagine, because I know. For my group alone, answering the unconstitutional and illegal demands foisted on us by the IRS bureaucracy cost us almost 5,000 man-hours. And we were just one tea party group. Now multiply that across hundreds of similar groups that were similarly targeted and think of the burden imposed. In many cases, it was enough to break the backs of small groups and force them to shut down - exactly what our IRS adversaries wanted.

That's what happened to tea party groups like ours when we simply followed the law as we understood it and applied to the Internal Revenue Service for designation as charitable non-profit organizations. For years we were stonewalled, targeted for our political beliefs, and discriminated against.

What if people lost their jobs for how they think politically, or were harassed and intimidated by the public, in addition to being scared by the government into not donating? That can happen, has happened, and we have every reason to believe it will happen again -- especially if H.R. 1 becomes law. Today it may be people you hate, people you attack, who are on the short end of the stick. But what happens if and when the tables are reversed in the future, and they attack you? It is wrong in either case. I would not wish what happened to us on our worst enemy.

No one ever went to jail for that unconstitutional and illegal harassment against us. Heck, no one was even prosecuted.

Now, along comes H.R. 1, which contains language that essentially codifies what the IRS did to us.

This law has been misnamed - it should be called The Lois Lerner Tribute Act.

What happened to tea party groups at the hands of the IRS was wrong. We shouldn't make it easier for that kind of thing to happen again by turning protected ""legislative"" speech into regulated ""political"" speech."" In this area, experience teaches us that less donor disclosure, not more, is the better path to guaranteeing protection of our constitutional freedoms.",485,Breitbart,Jenny Beth Martin: H.R. 1 Should Be Called 'The Lois Lerner Tribute Act'
"""The truth is that the politics and policies of open borders have failed the American people,"" Nielsen tweeted after enduring a hearing in which Democrats lashed at her for recording the catch and release of economic migrants.

Throughout the March 6 hearing, Democrats ignored the mounting evidence of murders, rapes, and robberies among the migrants, and the data showing that cheap labor migrants drive down Americans' wages and opportunities. The Democrats ignored Nielsen's measured calls for border reforms and slammed her enforcement of the law, even after she calmly described the loopholes which are encouraging a wave of perhaps 900,000 migrants this year.

""We are on track for this year for 900,000 apprehensions at the border,"" she told the House's Committee on Homeland Security, one day after officials revealed that 76,000 migrants flooded across the border in February 2019.

Our broken system endures, and the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis at our Southwest Border leaves many minors and families at extreme risk of being exploited by traffickers, human smugglers, gangs, and other nefarious actors seeking to profit at their expense.

Activist courts, congressional inaction, and criminals intent on breaking our laws stand in the way of confronting illegal and uncontrolled migration threatening our safety and security. What was a crisis is now a full-fledged emergency.

The U.S. leads the world in welcoming individuals fleeing persecution. In the 2017 calendar year, the U.S. granted asylum and refugee status to more individuals than Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom combined.

We welcome those who come to America legally, especially those who are truly fleeing persecution and who seek refuge in our country.

Migrants are walking through the border by presenting a child while claiming asylum. The maneuver exploits legal rules which are championed by Democrats and progressive judges and which require border officials to release the migrants within 20 days so they can get jobs until their court date, two or three years later. This open door is expected to encourage migration by many additional migrants.

In contrast to Nielsen's dramatic invocation of ""open borders,"" President Donald Trump is offering a mixed message, simultaneously praising border operations, characterizing the migration as an ""invasion,"" and championing his emergency declaration.

On March 6, for example, Trump told a panel of business leaders that ""We are doing an amazing job [on the border] considering it's really an onslaught very much. I call it 'invasion.' They always get upset when I say 'an invasion.' But it really is somewhat of an invasion.""

On February 15, in a speech at the Rose Garden, Trump announced his emergency plan for the wall, while also declaring:

We've detained more people. Our border agents are doing such incredible work. Our military has been incredible. We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there. We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire. It's very successful.

But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them. And it's very necessary. We've broken up two caravans that are on their way. They just are breaking. They're in the process of breaking up. We have another one that we haven't been able to break up yet.

We've been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before. I want to thank the President. I want to thank Mexico.

...

We want to have a safe country. I ran on a very simple slogan: ""Make America Great Again."" If you're going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you're going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don't have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.

But we've done a fantastic job, but we haven't been given the equipment. We haven't been given the walls.

Trump's mixed message includes cheerleading for Americans while arguing that investors should be allowed to import labor across the U.S. border -- typically described ""merit"" labor. This permission would exempt investors and CEOs from the usual requirement to compete in the free market for Americans' time and work.

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after high school or university. Then the federal government imports roughly 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar workers, and it also tolerates eight million illegal workers.

In 2019, because of catch-and-release rules mandated by Congress and the courts, the federal government also will likely release at least 350,000 Central American laborers into the U.S. job market, even as at least 500,000 more migrants also sneak past U.S. border defenses or overstay their visas.

Overall, in 2019, the U.S. government will allow at least two million new foreign workers into the United States to compete for the starter jobs sought by the latest wave of four million U.S. graduates. The new migrants also undermine the 24 million other Americans and the roughly three million legal immigrants who have joined the workforce since 2014.

This federal policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth for investors shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.",486,Breitbart,DHS Nielsen: 'Open Borders Have Failed the American People' | Breitbart
"She's the shimmering queen of Midtown's night sky -- a mirage of brightly lit triangular forms riding sensuous, sculpted layers to a radiant peak. The Chrysler Building after dark seems a feminine foil to the Empire State Building's muscular lines. A popular postcard by artist Hudson Talbott depicts Chrysler as a sexy lady on the arm of a tuxedo-clad Empire State.

Yet Chrysler's long-closed, private, top-floor Cloud Club was open only to men. The only woman to use one of the tower's handful of apartments, Life magazine photographer Margaret Bourke-White, needed office tenant Time Inc. to sign her lease. Landlord Walter P. Chrysler wouldn't rent to women -- not even to Bourke-White, who risked her life to take iconic photos while perched on one of the tower's 59th-floor gargoyles.

The anti-female attitude was one of many ironies, oddities and calamities in the skyscraper's roller-coaster, 90-year history. The Chrysler Building's brief reign as the world's tallest building inspired others -- including the Empire State -- to shoot higher in the sky. Yet for all its iconic beauty and influence, the tower was twice in foreclosure and its interior in ruins.

Today it faces a new challenge: It's up for sale and skyline-lovers and architectural enthusiasts fear for its future.

A legally protected city landmark, Chrysler can't be torn down. But because it is antiquated compared to modern office skyscrapers, some believe it might not get the $800 million its owners want for it. They worry that it could be partly converted to apartments or a hotel, a long process that could darken the fabulous crown for months or years.

But the Chrysler Building has seen worse times. Its saga is one of unbridled ambition, fortunes lost and made -- and enduring resilience.

It rose in an age when visionary captains of industry pursued their dreams -- not only on Wall Street but in the sky over Manhattan.

Appropriately, it all started with the creator of Coney Island's Dreamland.

Developer and politician William H. Reynolds launched the fabled seaside amusement park in 1904. He had bigger ambitions: He hired architect William Van Alen to design the world's tallest building on land he leased at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan.

But after Van Alen drew up ever-taller schemes, Reynolds didn't have the dough to build. In 1928, he sold the lease and the architect's design for an 808-foot-tall tower to Walter Chrysler for $2 million (more than $29 million in today's dollars).

Chrysler wanted a prestigious New York corporate home for the Chrysler Corp., which he founded and owned. He wanted it to be a dynamic symbol of the machine age -- and to be the tallest tower on earth.

But his vision was challenged by a planned building far downtown -- 40 Wall St., which is today the Trump Building. That project was the brainchild of banker George L. Ohstrom and a team of architects led by Van Alen's former partner H. Craig Severance. (The actual chief designer of 40 Wall is believed to be Severance's associate Yasuo Matsui, a Japanese-American architect who was unconscionably placed under house arrest by the US government during World War II.)

Chrysler and Ohstrom vied for two years to come out on top. Each kept announcing plans for a taller tower. Severance finally said 40 Wall would top off at 925 feet; Van Alen said Chrysler, after several height increases, would reach only 850 feet.

The spectacular crown lighting in 1981 using white neon tubes -- following plans by Van Alen that were never previously used -- drew ""aahs,"" but disguised the fact that the building's guts were falling apart.

Then, in a coup that's the stuff of legend, Van Alen secretly assembled a 185-foot tall steel spire inside Chrysler's crown. On Oct. 23, 1929, it was hoisted up in stages.

""The signal was given,"" Van Alen wrote the following year in Architectural Forum magazine, ""and the spire gradually emerged from the top of the dome like a butterfly from its cocoon, and in about 90 minutes was securely riveted in position, the highest piece of stationary steel in the world."" The Chrysler Building was the skyline king at the then-unprecedented height of 1,046 feet.

The 40 Wall team could only watch helplessly. To this day, 40 Wall suffers a height-inferiority complex. Before he entered politics, Donald Trump once insisted to me that 40 Wall was ""taller, much taller,"" than nearby 70 Pine St., which in fact tops 40 Wall by 25 feet.

The Empire State Building became the world height champ one year later -- spurred on by Chrysler. Empire State's builders first planned an 80-story tower, but added six more to top Chrysler by four feet.

But they added 200 more feet for insurance, raising the roof height to 1,250 feet after Chrysler's spire stunt. Empire State's backer, John J. Raskob, feared that Walter Chrysler might again ""pull [another] trick, like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.""

The stock market began its epic crash the day after Chrysler topped off. Even so, the tower opened on May 27, 1930, as home to the Chrysler Corp. Texaco and Time Inc. soon signed on as tenants.

Their new home was and is like no other building. The lobby, drenched in maroon and red-orange African marble and chrome, symbolizes early 20th-century corporate power. The elevators boast a sumptuous blend of woods from Japan, England, China and Cuba.

Auto motifs, such as hubcaps, adorn the tower's facade of nearly 4 million hand-laid bricks. Giant chromium nickel gargoyles stand sentry on the 59th floor (where a flying dragon took up residence in the totally weird 1982 movie ""Q: The Winged Serpent"").

Above the 77th floor, the structure blossoms into what everyone loves most -- a Jazz Age fantasy of stainless-steel arches and triangular windows topped by the gleaming spire.

Architect Robert A.M. Stern cherishes its ""swagger and originality."" Sarah Jessica Parker has called it ""this magnificent piece of art .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. a sand castle .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. You could imagine that the sand was wet and you were shaping it with your fingers.""

The Cloud Club on the 66th-68th floors opened as a Prohibition-era speakeasy on July 1930. Regulars included such moguls as E.F. Hutton, Pan Am founder Juan Trippe, publisher Cond√© Nast and Walter Chrysler himself. They noshed on Dover sole, black-bean soup, and ""No. 18"" pink grapefruit, which was ""huge, huge, more than twice as big as any grapefruit in a supermarket,"" according to a Florida agricultural official.

Developer Jerry Speyer, whose company, Tishman Speyer, would rescue the tower from the brink of oblivion a half-century later, told friends at the Cloud Club in the late 1940s, ""I never want to leave here.""

Chrysler was 70 percent leased by 1935 -- compared with only 23 percent at its taller rival, dubbed the ""Empty State Building.""

Walter Chrysler's family inherited his skyscraper after he died in 1940, and it changed hands several times after that. It started losing juice when the Chrysler Corp. moved out in the 1950s. Owners rented space to small tenants, such as dentists -- because finding corporate tenants was like pulling teeth.

But the Chrysler Building has seen worse times. Its saga is one of unbridled ambition, fortunes lost and made -- and enduring resilience.

Most famous was Dr. Charles M. Weiss, an innovator in implant technology who had his ""Dentist in the Sky"" practice there from 1962 until his death in 2012. Skyline views through his office's 71st-floor triangular windows gave patients a stress-easing high without laughing gas.

The tower entered its dark age when overleveraged real-estate kingpins Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo Jr. bought it in the early 1960s. Goldman knew it was trouble, later calling the purchase ""a big gamble for us .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. We laid awake many a night over it.""

Rising crime and the city's near-bankruptcy in the 1970s chased Chrysler's few remaining large tenants, such as Texaco, to the suburbs. The owners treated it ""like a tenement in the South Bronx,"" architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote. CBRE real-estate broker Bruce Surry, who later brought in ad agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample as a tenant, recalled to The Post, ""No maintenance was done for years. There were rats and vermin all over.""

The mostly vacant wreck went into default and was sold again to Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke for $90 million in 1978.

Cooke did nothing to arrest the decay. The spectacular crown lighting in 1981 using white neon tubes -- following plans by Van Alen that were never previously used -- drew ""aahs,"" but disguised the fact that the building's guts were falling apart.

The Cloud Club closed in 1979. It was reduced to bare remains when I saw it in 1985. Only a few of its mural fragments gave any hint of past glory.

Tishman Speyer finally pulled the Chrysler Building out of its tailspin in 1997, when it paid $220 million for the tower and two adjacent buildings. Tishman spent $100 million more to restore its original splendor before it sold a 90 percent stake to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) in 2008 for $800 million.

"Recent unrest there now threatens France, with possibly another migration wave on the way.

After surviving several assassination attempts by French partisans of Alg√©rie Fran√ßaise, Charles de Gaulle in March 1962 signed a peace agreement ending French sovereignty over Algeria. The war for Algerian independence had been long and vicious, marked by terrorism and torture. Everyone who mattered in French politics believed in 1954 that Algeria was an integral part of France, to be defended at all cost. But by 1962, their view had changed. With cold realism, de Gaulle remarked of the conflict, now in its seventh year, ""As for France, it will be necessary for her now to interest herself in something else.""

France did fine after granting independence to Algeria. Algeria less so. The Algerians who had taken the side of France, fought in its army, or served as administrators of the Algerian government fared terribly -- many suffered appalling deaths at the hands of the vengeful victors. According to Alistair Horne's Savage War of Peace, 15,000 were killed in the summer after the March armistice.

An important reason de Gaulle broke with his conservative army supporters and became determined to negotiate Algerian independence was that he thought the French and Algerians were fundamentally different peoples. For him, Alg√©rie Fran√ßaise, the ""France of a hundred million"" supplemented by Algeria's population and vast reserves of oil and gas, was total fantasy. His colleague Alain Peyrefitte quoted him as saying privately in 1959 that you could mix Arabs and French together, but like oil and vinegar in a bottle, after a while they would inevitably separate. He worried that an Alg√©rie Fran√ßaise would lead inevitably to his home village of Colombey-les-Deux-√âglises being transformed into Colombey-Les-Deux-Mosqu√©es.

Nevertheless, Algeria after independence remained tightly connected to France economically, not least as a principal source of ""temporary"" factory workers, a migration that began during the Algerian war itself. Even as the need for factory labor diminished, France instituted family reunification provisions to allow workers to marry and bring their wives to France, a provision no subsequent president was able to undo. There are now some three million Algerians in France with French or dual citizenship. France's relationship with the Algerian government is privileged -- every French president makes a state visit to Algeria in his first year of office. Trade is mutually important and Algeria plays a critical role in French African policy, as it borders Mali, Niger, and Libya. Basically everyone paying attention in France, except perhaps for Islamist militants, fears deeply the prospect of destabilization or unrest in Algeria.

But it might be coming nonetheless. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Algeria's president, suffered a serious stroke six years ago and now seldom appears in public. Nonetheless at age 82, he (or those who speak for him) are insisting that he run for a fifth presidential term. Since Algeria's elections are less than free, with the ruling party in full control of ballot access and vote counting, that means his victory is preordained. Since the Bouteflika announcement, hundreds of thousands of Algerians have taken to the streets in spirited but peaceful protests in cities across the country. They've been joined by their brethren in French cities.

Few seem to know the true balance of forces in Algerian politics: there is a powerful state apparatus linked to the army, but no strong political parties. Islamists won the first round of legislative elections in 1991, which provoked the army to stage a coup that set off a brutal civil war. Six years later, a party linked to the army won legislative elections, and in 1999, Bouteflika won the presidency and initiated a form of national reunification through amnesty. It is this Bouteflika, a young vanguard of Algeria's liberation movement in the 1960s, a conciliatory figure after the civil war of the 1990s, and now the octogenarian figurehead of a regime widely seen as corrupt, who sits atop Algeria's structure like a cork on a bottle. And no one knows what will happen when the cork is removed.

In France, President Emmanuel Macron's government last week recalled its ambassador for consultations, and regional specialists are saying, perhaps wishfully, that the Islamists are not nearly as popular as they were in the '90s. No one quite knows what the relevant analogies are. The Arab Spring, which led eventually to a military dictatorship in Egypt and a savage civil war in Syria, hardly seems promising. Nor does the revolt against Libya's Moammar Gaddafi, which led, after France supported the rebels, to his death and the breakdown of Libya as a functioning state. The sad fact is that there are few attractive models for governmental succession in Arab world (one might look hopefully to Tunisia, though it's a tiny country compared to Algeria).

The Franco-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal captures well the ambiguity many feel. In a recent interview for Le Figaro, he welcomed massive peaceful demonstrations as the lifting of lethargy from a people who deserve better government than they have. He noted that Algeria is a rich country with a large number of educated and talented people. But he asked, ""how does one pass to the next stage, of organizing free elections, repairing the damage done by 57 years of dictatorship and corruption, putting the country to back to work, providing a social blueprint. Who is going to lead that? Another Bouteflika produced in a lab of the security services? A committee of public safety? A helpful prophet?""

Sansal added that Islamists are always waiting in the wings, numerous and organized and determined. Algeria, he adds, is a conservative Muslim country. Salafism is a powerful force there, one the government has spent billions trying to counter through the development of a ""true"" Islam, building countless air conditioned mosques to rival the extremists. The result is that huge patches of the populace devote themselves daily to various forms of exorcism and have scant connection to modernity.

Sansal (and most other commentators) insist that the army's power won't fail -- it controls the country completely and is determined to resist any Islamist challenge. But he also acknowledges that it never really won the civil war of the 1990s, that the Islamists were never defeated politically.

If Algeria were to collapse into chaos, France would be destabilized as well. The civil war resulted in a huge migration surge; this time it would be larger. Among the migrants would be a large number of Islamists, and illegal immigration would mean the French couldn't control everyone who would come. And France, at least some quarters, is already an Islamic Republic in embryo.

Macron recognizes that Algeria could become the iceberg that drowns his presidency, easily surpassing his bodyguard scandal (the Benalla affair) and the Gilets Jaunes. His administration seems torn between public displays of political correctness and worries about Islamicization. During the campaign, he made a grand gesture of accusing France of ""crimes against humanity"" during the colonial period, then walked the statement back. One of his key legislative allies said recently there was no real difference between the Muslim headscarf and a headband worn by Catholic schoolgirls, only to rebuked by a top female cabinet member who observed that ""no woman in the world has been stoned for not wearing a headband.""

Official France repeats over and over its support for Algerian self-determination while fearing that Algerians will make a terrible choice, one that deprives France of a valuable strategic partner and unleashes an unmanageable migration wave. The conservative journals are full of admonitions about the need for tough-minded realism while offering few suggestions as to what this might entail. France's population was 17 times Algeria's in 1830, the year of colonial conquest. Now it is less than double. De Gaulle was right to say that in liberating Algeria, France would have to find something else to worry about. But 57 years later, it is proving not so easy.",488,The American Conservative,Algeria: The Iceberg That Could Sink Emmanuel Macron
"Democrats move forward with anti-gun agenda; firearms attorney Ryan Cleckner weighs in.

Democrats in the U.S. House are likely to approve spending $50 million in taxpayer funds for public health research on gun violence. While that may sound like a good idea at first glance, it really wouldn't do anything to reduce gun violence in our country.

I testified Thursday before the House Appropriations Committee's health subcommittee to inject facts into the discussion of the Democratic bill.

It should go without saying that everyone opposes gun violence. But it's important to take effective measures to deal with this problem and not simply take actions that sound appealing but won't really save lives.

BLACK GUNS MATTER FOUNDER SAYS CONSERVATIVES SHOULD REACH OUT TO POTENTIAL ALLIES IN INNER CITIES

The idea behind the $50 million in research funding is to have medical professionals apply tools they developed to study cancer, heart disease and other diseases and use them to study crime, accidental death and suicide. But to state the obvious, gun violence and diseases are two very different things.

The National Rifle Association - regularly demonized in the media and by many Democrats - has been blamed for preventing academics from doing research on firearms. So supporters of the bill that would spend $50 million to research gun violence as a public health issue say their bill is needed to stop the NRA from blocking vital research that will save lives.

But there's a big problem with the argument: it's not true.

Opponents of the Second Amendment who are eager to impose as many restrictions as possible on firearms falsely claim that a measure enacted in 1966 called the Dickey Amendment - named after former Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark. - barred research on gun violence to be funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But in reality, here is what the reviled Dickey Amendment states: ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to *advocate or promote gun control.""* (Italics added).

The point of that plain language is to say CDC-funded research is fine. CDC advocacy is not. So despite what gun-control zealots say, objective research based on facts is allowed under the Dickey Amendment.

The amendment came in response to top CDC officials advocating various gun control laws, such as prohibiting people from carrying concealed handguns.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns falsely claimed in a 2013 report that as a result of the Dickey Amendment ""academic publishing on firearm violence fell by 60% between 1996 and 2010.""

But the mayors' group measured something different: firearms research in medical journals as a percentage of all medical research.

There was no decrease in either the total number of papers or pages devoted to firearms research. But with whole new fields of medicine being developed, there was an explosion of published medical studies in other areas.

In fact, since 2011 firearms research in medical journals has increased more than five-fold, as former New York City Mayor and multi-billionaire Michael Bloomberg has poured untold tens of millions of dollars into the effort.

By the fall of 2013, George Soros' Open Society Foundation and the equally left-wing Joyce and MacArthur Foundations had amassed $16 million for the Fund for a Safer Future.

In 2013, President Obama met with 23 large foundations to fund research that would support a national push for gun control.

Additionally, states including California and New Jersey have devoted millions of dollars into the gun control effort. In 2018, the RAND Corp. announced a $20 million fund that the nonprofit research organization wants to grow to $50 million.

The federal government has also generously funded firearms research, spending over $43 million between 2015 and 2018. In 2016 and 2017, the National Institute of Justice gave a total of $1.3 million to just one group headed by Boston University gun control advocate Michael Siegel.

I have been an academic for most of my life and can't fathom how one could legitimately spend that much money on the small studies that came out of the grants. But no one seems to worry whether this federal research money - money taken from pockets of American taxpayers - is being wasted.

Academics David Stark and Nigam Shah stated in a widely referenced letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association: ""Between 2004 and 2015, gun violence research was substantially underfunded and understudied relative to other leading causes of death, based on mortality rates for each cause.""

But this claim assumes that the life-saving benefits of a dollar spent on research is the same across 30 different causes of mortality, from heart disease to shootings.

In reality, no cost-benefit analysis exists on the lifesaving effects of different studies. Doctors who study diseases use very different methodologies than the public health academics who dominate firearms research in medical journals. Controlled, randomized testing of a drug is quite different from studying human social behavior.

Stark and Shah compare federal funding for different types of research, but about 97 percent of all medical journal research on firearms is not federally funded. Most of it is funded by universities. Looking at just federal funding misses that.

Furthermore, just looking at medical journals means excluding firearms research by economists, criminologists, and law professors.

While cancer research is only published in medical journals, that is definitely not true of firearms research. Also, cancer research may simply require more funding due to a need for costly laboratory equipment and drugs.

All this gun research money from the government as well as wealthy people such as Bloomberg and foundations is going overwhelmingly to public health researchers who consistently produce very poorly done and misleading studies.

These researchers cherry pick research to focus on particular states in particular years. If 20 states have passed a law, why look at just one? Obviously, to find the result that best supports the preconceived advocacy agenda of researchers.

For example, it doesn't make sense to claim that a Connecticut gun licensing law caused a 40 percent drop in the state's homicide rate when homicide rates fell nationally by 32 percent. If the period of study had been one year longer or one year shorter, the national drop would have been much larger.

In another example, studies try to scare Americans into not owning guns in the home because of claimed risks to children. To exaggerate the risks that households with guns face, researchers lump in gang fights involving ""children"" who are 18 and 19 years of age.

But in their focus to control guns, they are missing what causes the violence. Over 50 percent of murders occur in just two percent of the counties and even in those counties, it is mainly in very small areas of about 10 blocks.

The problem causing a great deal of violence is drug gangs. If you are going to solve the problem you have to reduce the profits those gangs get from selling drugs.

Our federal, state and local governments have spent huge amounts of money for many years trying to stop drug gangs from getting the drugs they sell. It defies logic to say we will have any greater success stopping these gangs from getting the guns that they use to protect their valuable drugs.

Unfortunately, politicians and their appointees just can't keep politics out of their decisions about how to spend the money they collect from the American people.

"Anti-Zionism manifests itself in many forms -- and it isn't any better than its older cousin, anti-Semitism.

Britain's opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has elevated it to an art form, describing terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah as ""friends"" and causing Labour members to bolt. In France, persistent attacks on Jews and deadly rioting by self-declared anti-Zionists forced President Emmanuel Macron to ¬≠denounce their cause as a ""reinvented form of anti-Semitism.""

Now a new crop of American politicians want in, too. Oh, sure, our anti-Zionists claim to champion the right to criticize Israel. Or its policies. Or Likud. Or the occupation, apartheid, racism, whatever. It's just an accident that the new anti-Zionists are obsessed with the world's one Jewish state.

On Monday, New York Rep. ¬≠Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (who's become Corbyn's BFF) took to Twitter to defend the right of her colleague Ilhan Omar to hate -- oops, ""criticize"" -- Israel. So did Rep. Rashida Tlaib and, soon after, three leading Democratic presidential contenders.

Earlier Omar, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized Israel for -- well, she didn't say what -- while traveling in the Horn of Africa. ""Proud to see peace prosper here,"" she wrote from Eritrea.

Eritrea is ranked just behind North Korea as the world's most oppressive country. But if you're a young Muslim woman of color, smearing democratic Israel while praising much more abhorrent regimes can sound really, really cool.

On the left, ""Zionism is racism"" is back in vogue. Never mind that the far right's racists are all-in, too: David Duke is now a full-fledged ""anti-Zionist"" and celebrates Omar.

What drives today's anti-Zionists? Is it principled opposition to Theodore Herzl's vision, born in the late 19th century, of Jews ¬≠returning to their ancestral land?

Herzl famously said: ""If you will it, it is no dream."" And just like Kevin Costner's baseball diamond in a cornfield, the early Zionists built the dream, and the Jewish people came.

Today Israel is a global power with a rambunctious democratic culture, a free press and a booming, innovative economy.

The Zionists ended the image of Jews as perpetual victims. In an age when victimhood is fetishized, Israel's triumph is frowned upon.

But anti-Zionism isn't so new or hip. It was first perfected by Josef ¬≠Stalin, who drew on Russian anti-Semitism by renaming it -- with deadly results to any Soviet comrade suspected of Zionism.

The Soviet doctrine persisted after Stalin and was eventually embedded in a United Nations resolution that still echoes in Turtle Bay's halls and beyond decades after its smear was rescinded: Zionism is racism. The Soviet Union collapsed; the Jewish state survived.

Do today's anti-Zionists truly envision a better world if Israel ceased to exist? And what happens to the Israelis in that scenario?

""Go back to where you came from"" is nonsense, as most Israeli Jews were born there. Instead, ¬≠sophisticated anti-Zionists advocate a ""one-state solution"" that would turn the country into a multinational state with no established religion.

But that ""religion"" thing is nonsense too. True, Israel celebrates Jewish holidays, and things slow down on Saturdays. But Israel is a nation, not an open-air synagogue. Roughly half of Israelis are secularists, worshipping the art of living well rather than the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

And whether religious or secular, Israelis look around in their neighborhood, and they prefer an open, Jewish-majority society to the Mideast's other oppressive ¬≠regimes. A binational state would threaten their vibrant democracy -- and likely exacerbate Arab-Jew enmity, rather than end it.

But sure, want to criticize Israel? Go for it. But if you appear obsessed with one state and one state only, while ignoring China's oppression of Muslims, cheering on the thuggish Venezuelan regime or praising Eritrea, your critique will be idiotic -- and also bigoted.

By the way: Israel's election campaign is in full gear, and everything -- policy, politics, personal life, police investigations -- is out in the open. Just listen to vicious but fact-based attacks that are made by, well, true Blue and White Zionists against each other. They're better at it than Omar & Co.",490,New York Post,How can the anti-Zionists pretend the world would be better off

"In a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight, Greenpeace co-founder and former president of Greenpeace Canada Patrick Moore described the ideology of contemporary ""eco-fascists"" as ""against humans."" He further lamented the replacement of Greenpeace's former ""humanitarian"" ethos with one which cast humanity ""as the enemies of nature.""

Moore explained to Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak how Greenpeace's original spirit of celebrating humanity was usurped by an anti-human Malthusian vision:

By the mid-1980s, Greenpeace had drifted from the original concept of green and peace -- meaning environment and people, [to] save civilization from nuclear war -- so we cared about people and had a humanitarian orientation as well as an environmental one.

That was the marriage of green and peace, but by the time the eighties came along, the peace had kinda got lost and all it was was save-the-whales and save-the-earth, and now humans were being characterized as the enemies of nature, as if there's too many of us and there shouldn't be so many and people shouldn't have children -- and all this stuff that's still coming up with AOC, now, telling people that maybe they shouldn't have children because the world's coming to an end.

Moore recalled his departure from Greenpeace following the organization's adoption of anti-human ideology:

So I don't believe any of that stuff. At the highest level, I had to get out of Greenpeace at that point because my fellow directors were all pushing this narrative about humans being the enemies of the Earth. It's way too much like Original Sin for me, where all the other life is good and only the humans are bad, and I just do not buy that. We're from nature, just like all the other species are, and humans are mostly good. A few bad people make a big difference, it's true, but people are mostly good and mostly try to be good. So I didn't buy that.

Moore noted how his fellow Greenpeace directors, at the time of his departure, did not have scientific credentials or backgrounds.

""We basically got hijacked by extreme leftists or eco-fascists as they are sometimes referred to today. ... We did a lot of good stuff but it went bad,"" said Moore.

Greenpeace's ostensibly environmental cause is a feature of the Democrat Party's advocacy for halting ""climate change,"" explained Moore. He highlighted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) proposed Green New Deal as illustrative of the left's ""toxic mix"" of politics, religion, and ideology:

The Democrats might as well sign a suicide pact, not just for their political future, but for the future of the economy of the United States for all these people to be piling on this Green New Deal, which is a complete and utter ridiculous document. To ban fossil fuels in ten years ... first, food production would collapse, second, anybody trying to get food into the cities would fail, because the people on the outside of the cities would capture it so they could have it, and the people on the inside is where it would start. The rot would start in the center of the big cities where people would begin starve to death after they'd eaten all their pets. They would actually start killing and eating each other.

It's not just a religion, it's a toxic mix of religion and ideology, of politics and religion. It's just absolutely toxic. ... They are against humans. Why would humans be against humans? Especially when we have developed such an incredible civilization.

""The idea that we're killing the Earth is crazy,"" concluded Moore.

"Duke tweeted his praise of Omar on Thursday, calling her the ""most important member of the US Congress"" now that she has stood up to Democrat Party leadership after making antisemitic statements against Israel:

Duke tweets a link to his website where he says he discusses why he believes Omar is the ""most important member of the US Congress"" now in an hour-long radio segment. But during the overtly anti-Semitic hour-long segment, he does not specifically mention Omar-he just repeatedly bashes ""Zionists,"" rips the United States for having ""unleashed Jewish power,"" attacks ""Jewish influence in government"" and ""Jewish elite control over media.""

Particularly relating to Omar, however, on the website posting it says regarding Duke and his colleague: ""In particular, they heaped praise on Ilhan Omar (D-New Somalia) for being the one person in Congress willing to notice AIPAC and the 'dual' loyalty of many (((members of Congresss))).""

Duke and other white supremacists use three parentheses to identify Jews on social media -- an offensive practice that has led some people to add parentheses to their social media profiles in defiance or in solidarity with Duke's targets.

Duke has been a lightning rod in American politics for years, and in recent years the media and left have gone after Republicans-particularly President Trump-for having been praised by him. During the 2016 presidential campaign, the media demanded repeatedly that Trump disavow Duke-which he did. But now Duke has endorsed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI)-a Hawaiian Democrat-in the 2020 presidential election.

This is not the first time Duke has taken up Omar's cause either. Back in early February, when she first came under the national spotlight for anti-Semitism at the beginning of the new Congress, Duke backed her up publicly as well.

Duke's decision to back Omar now comes in the wake of several Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and presidential candidates like Sens Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), as well as many other Democrats, refusing to demand that Omar apologize and attempting to explain away her comments as somehow not deliberately anti-Semitic.

Meanwhile, Democrats have been struggling to get a resolution condemning anti-Semitism across the finish line on the floor of the House, rescheduling votes multiple times and failing to offer a coherent narrative from their party's fractious leadership-all while their 2020 presidential candidates spar over this very issue, and the party cannot focus on governing at the moment.

HOUSE TO VOTE ON ANTI-HATE RESOLUTION, WON'T ADDRESS OMAR

Fox News: ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats plan to hold a vote in the House on opposing all 'forms of hatred,' after days of infighting within the caucus led to the revision of language in a resolution originally intended to condemn anti-Semitism. But Pelosi, during a press conference, said the resolution won't single out Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who provoked the outcry over comments seen as anti-Semitic. 'It's not about her,' Pelosi said of Omar. 'It's about these forms of hatred.' Text of the seven page resolution was released Thursday afternoon. It condemns anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities as 'hateful expressions of intolerance that are contrary to the values and aspirations of the United States.' The resolution doesn't mention Omar by name, but it says 'imputations of dual loyalty threaten American democracy and have no place in American political discourse.' ...The resolution also references the 2017 white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, the 2015 murder of black congregants at a Charleston church and the 2018 murder of worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The resolution originated after Omar's comments.""

This comes after many unforced errors - NYT: ""More significantly, the battle overshadowed what was supposed to be a week when Democrats focused on the rollout of the For the People Act, or H.R. 1, a comprehensive government reform package intended to embody the party's progressive policy response to Mr. Trump. While Democrats fought with one another, Republicans held news conferences, released videos and tried to define the centerpiece of the House Democratic agenda as an immoral giveaway to politicians. ... Formulating a unified political message and enforcing party discipline have always posed challenges for House Democrats, who represent a broader demographic and political coalition than the Republicans they supplanted in last year's midterm elections. ... Message control has grown far more difficult since Democrats lost the majority in 2010, thanks to social media -- which gives backbenchers like Ms. Omar the power to dominate the news cycle by pressing send on her cellphone.""

Republicans delight - Politico: ""GOP leaders had been weighing whether to take their own action against Omar... But Republicans, who already successfully used procedural tools to rebuke Omar for using anti-Semitic tropes last month, are instead choosing to not respond right now, forcing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to pick from a difficult set of options. 'I would like to see what the Democrats are going to do,' Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Wednesday. 'We've already led on this issue.' ...Republicans think their best strategy is to just let Democrats tear each other apart over the issue. And the GOP's options are limited in the minority anyway: they likely can't use procedural tools on the election reform bill to punish Omar, because it wouldn't be germane. And forcing a vote on a censure resolution rebuking Omar could spark a nasty tit-for-tat with Democrats.""

Bernie, Warren, Harris stand with Omar - The Hill: ""Presidential candidates on Wednesday defended Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) amid an avalanche of criticism over her comments slamming pro-Israel groups and politicians. ... Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is Jewish, expressed fear that a House resolution intended to rebuke Omar could hinder a larger conversation over U.S. support for Israel. ... Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wrote in a statement obtained by HuffPost that continued attention directed at Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, puts her at risk of possible violence. ... Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) later condemned reported threats against Omar and pushed back on the notion that criticizing Israel is inherently anti-Semitic.""

BROWN OUT

WaPo: ""Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio announced Thursday that he will not seek the presidency, a decision he said came after a tour of early primary states left him more confident that his party was focusing more on labor and workers than it had in 2016. 'I will do everything I can to elect a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate in 2020,' Brown said in a statement. 'The best place for me to make that fight is in the United States Senate.' Brown, 66, is the second Democratic senator to pass on a White House bid this week; Oregon's Jeff Merkley had released a similar statement Monday. Both senators had hired staff in some early states and had begun to sketch out the argument that a populist Democrat with a record of winning white, working-class voters could break the coalition that narrowly elected Donald Trump.""

Biden for real, reportedly - NYT: ""The pieces for a Joseph R. Biden Jr. presidential campaign are falling into place: His nucleus of advisers has begun offering campaign positions to seasoned Democratic strategists. They are eyeing a headquarters in Delaware or nearby Philadelphia and a launch date in the beginning of April. Mr. Biden's family is on board -- his wife, Jill, enthusiastically so. Mr. Biden has also been privately reaching out to a range of influential Democrats, including party donors, members of Congress and allies in the early primary states, to gauge their support. A pillar of organized labor, the International Association of Fire Fighters, is prepared to support him in the Democratic primary. And in recent weeks, Mr. Biden's strategist, Steve Ricchetti, has called a handful of would-be candidates and their aides to signal that the former vice president is likely to enter the race and of late has been telling Democrats that he's 95 percent committed to running, according to officials directly familiar with the discussions.""

Drucker: Haley's path - WashEx: ""Republican Nikki Haley is meticulously laying the foundation for a presidential bid in 2024, forming a nonprofit organization to sustain her political-rock-star profile while she builds a financial nest egg so her family can afford her political ambitions. Party insiders keeping tabs on Haley say the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations wouldn't challenge her old boss, President Trump, in the 2020 primary. ... With a coterie of advisers, Haley is choosing each step to maximize her notoriety and chart a course to the White House. Amid quiet maneuvering, Haley's immediate priority is making money. ... Haley in February launched Stand For America, a political nonprofit group, ostensibly to provide her a platform to influence national policy. ... Stand For America provides Haley a mechanism to interact with the lawmakers, conservative thought leaders, grassroots activists, and major Republican donors she'll need in her corner if she runs for president.""

HOUSE DEMS THINKING BIG FOR 2020

NBC News: ""Fresh off a 40-seat pickup in 2018, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching its 2020 campaign on Thursday hoping to preserve and even bolster the party's House majority. The DCCC, House Democrats' official campaign arm, is making an initial multi-million-dollar investment, deploying 60 grassroots organizers -- the largest number this early in the campaign season. In an interview with NBC News, DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., acknowledged House Democrats currently hold a 'fragile majority' that needs protection. Still, she said the committee sees opportunities to expand its reach in traditionally Republican-leaning districts in states including Texas and Arizona. The DCCC's paid grassroots organizers are being sent to 33 Republican-held or open districts and protecting newly elected Democrats in at least 14 states, Bustos said. Most will be based in middle class and upscale suburban areas that are diversifying, such as Orange County, California; Las Vegas and Minneapolis.""

THE JUDGE'S RULING: SUCH TORMENT

This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the president's many ""tormentors"": ""While the world watched the pseudo-negotiations in Hanoi, House Democrats were conducting a public hearing, over the objections of their Republicans colleagues, about Trump's alleged unlawful behavior before and while he was president. The sole witness at the hearings was Michael Cohen... While this was happening, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate were joining their House colleagues in opposition to the president's expenditure of funds that Congress had expressly declined to authorize. ... While all this was going on, The New York Times revealed that the FBI and the CIA declined to authorize a top-secret security clearance for the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner... The president has serious and powerful tormentors whom he cannot overcome by mockery alone."" More here.

""Greetings, In this note and on the podcast you have shared about the importance of passing on a proper Civics education that highlights the unique features and strengths of our system. You've also talked about 'small r republicanism' and its merits. I think often even in a regular semester-length civics class some of these more salient philosophical points are overshadowed by lots of mechanical facts about how a bill is created or how the representative counts for each state are calculated. While useful, I wonder if you could suggest a more focused high-school level resource that squarely addresses the primary philosophical foundations of our system - preventing tyranny, protecting individual freedom from the rule of the mob, balance of power, etc. I'm envisioning either a long essay or a book of a few chapters in length that a parent could review with their teenagers over one or two weekends.

"In audio obtained by ABC and that aired on Thursday's ""Good Morning America,"" former White House chief of staff John Kelly claimed that if asked by Hillary Clinton if she had won the election, he would have gone to work for as he had done with President Donald Trump.

Per ABC News, Kelly made those comments during a Q&A session at Duke University, which was closed to cameras.

""If Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, and she had called me and said 'I really need a good chief of staff here,' I'd have probably done it,"" Kelly said.

The Jackson estate suing HBO rather than offering recompense, let alone apologies. The president cursing during a speech at CPAC. The Bachelor's entire season hanging on whether a 27-year-old virgin will actually have sex with at least one of his finalists!

As a culture we seem to have divested ourselves of shame -- real shame, not the cheap and easy kind so easily doled out online, where anyone accused of ""age-shaming"" or ""body-shaming"" is expected to express, well, shame. Otherwise, there is never any reason to apologize, to admit full-on wrongdoing, let alone express deep, palpable shame over one's behavior.

We've seen it in the stance of so many #MeToo monsters, who appear not just defiant but confused as to why they are cast-offs, pariahs, or facing criminal court. R. Kelly just gave a truly unbelievable interview to Gayle King, in which he not only insisted that the numerous women who have accused him of statutory rape, abuse and of holding them hostage are all lying. It is he, Kelly said, who is the real victim here -- while jumping out of his seat and erupting in front of King. ""I'm fighting for my f-king life!"" he exclaimed. ""Are you all trying to kill me?""

Anti-semite Mel Gibson still makes movies. Congenital liar Brian Williams still anchors a nightly newscast. The governor of Virginia, still in office after racist pictures from his medical school yearbook appeared. The lieutenant governor of Virginia, still in office after being accused of sexual assault.

It's impossible to overstate what we're losing. Shame is crucial in well-functioning societies. It's an evolutionary adaptation that keeps us cooperating, considerate, and safe. There's a reason one of the most memorable scenes in all of ""Game of Thrones"" was Cersei's naked walk through the town square, pelted by food and human waste, to a group chanting one word: ""Shame!""

We were once sophisticated enough to fake it if we didn't feel it.

No more.

The last great public expression of shame, I think, was in 1995, when actor Hugh Grant went on the Tonight Show to express his deep mortification for, of all things, getting caught with a hooker. It seems such a quaint offense in our era of real sex scandals, ones that now include assault, rape, human trafficking rings and pedophilia -- yet such was the threat to Grant's rising career that he had to ask the American public for forgiveness.

""Showing the embarrassed face that everyone wanted to see,"" as the Los Angeles Times put it.

Why apologize when someone else will surely come along, doing or saying something even more egregious?

Not long after came the erosion, in politics and pop culture: Al Sharpton in a position of influence. Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee's sex tape in 1998. Bill Clinton wagging his finger and telling the American people, regarding intern Monica Lewinsky, ""I did not have sex with that woman."" OJ Simpson's book called ""If I Did It"" in 2007.

And all of this unfolding in a reality TV landscape with cameras in bedrooms and boardrooms, resulting in a culture less about apology and remorse than ""owning it"" -- bad behavior excusable or outright acceptable so long as one doubles down.

In 2016 it was conventional wisdom, in media and political circles, that Trump was completely unelectable after he said John McCain wasn't a war hero because ""I like people that weren't captured."" After the Access Hollywood ""grab them by the pussy"" tape was released, to no apology of any kind by Donald Trump and no real consequence, shame became irrelevant.

Yet here we are, ironically living in a perpetual outrage cycle that moves so fast we forget yesterday's controversy today, because a new one has supplanted it. Why apologize when someone else will surely come along, doing or saying something even more egregious? The danger is, of course, that apologies become seen as weak, remorse so rare that we barely recognize it.",496,New York Post,There is no shame left in America anymore

"Former Rep. Ralph Hall, a Texas Republican best known for switching parties near the end of his 17-term career from 1981 to 2015, died Thursday at the age of 95 at his home in Rockwall, Texas.

Hall's change of party allegiance in 2004 was met with little surprise from his Capitol Hill colleagues, as he had always been one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY SENATE MAY NOT SEE NEW 'NUCLEAR OPTION' ANY TIME SOON

Hall served as a longtime member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and eventually left the panel to become the chairman of the House Science Committee in 2010, when Republicans gained a majority in the lower chamber. At the time Hall first became the chairman, he was the oldest serving member of Congress at the age of 87.

While still a Democrat, Hall even endorsed George W. Bush, a fellow Texan, for the presidency in 2000. After Bush won the election, reports surfaced that the new administration was seriously considering Hall for the post of Energy Secretary.

Hall had always been a thorn in Democrats' side even before he changed parties. In 1985, he voted ""present"" rather than support then-Speaker Thomas ""Tip"" O'Neill's, D-Mass., reelection. And in 2002, Hall told Republican leaders that he would seriously consider backing J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for Speaker if he had the deciding vote.

Some political observers first thought that Hall would switch parties after Republicans took the majority in the House in the historic 1994 wave election. Instead, he helped create the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition within the Democratic caucus.

When Hall finally did switch parties, it was spurred in part by Congressional redistricting. In 2003, in drawing a new congressional map, the Republican-controlled Texas legislature established Hall's district in such a way that it favored the GOP. Faced with difficult reelection prospects, Hall registered as a Republican shortly before the filing deadline in January 2004.

When Hall announced his new status as a Republican, he cited the fact that he had often voted with Republicans throughout his tenure, as well as his support of President Bush.

""I have voted with the Republicans most of the time. The country is at war. When the country is at war you need to support the president. Some of my fellow congressmen have not been doing that,"" Hall said.

But he acknowledged that some would not view his party switch as favorably.

""I talked with some of my family. Some agreed, some did not. My wife didn't agree. She'd rather I quit than switch parties,"" Hall said.

Three years later, Hall's name surfaced in headlines again when Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) accused him, along with 71 other House members, of using campaign funds to pay relatives or their employers.

Hall defended hiring his daughter-in-law: ""I'm not sure that it's a good thing to do, but it's a safe thing to do.""

A World War II veteran, Hall's first cut his teeth in politics when he won election as county judge of Rockwall County in 1950. While serving, he attended law school at Southern Methodist University.

In 1962, Hall won election to the Texas state Senate, eventually attaining the position of president pro tempore by the time he left in 1972.

Hall stayed out of the public arena for eight years by working in the private sector as the president and CEO of Texas Aluminum Corporation and general counsel of Texas Extrusion Company. He ran for Congress in 1980 when then-Rep. Ray Roberts, R-Texas, a ten-term incumbent, announced his retirement. The margin foreshadowed Hall's legacy of policymaking on the fence: He won 52 percent of the vote in what would be the closest election of his political career.

In 2013, Hall announced his 2014 reelection campaign would be his last. It wasn't in the cards, however, as Hall lost in a runoff election to former U.S. Attorney, John Lee Ratcliffe.

When asked what he would do following his loss, he told Fox News he may ""go work at Wal-Mart. I have to have a job.""

The ""old-time conservative Democrat"" had a scare in 2014 while he was serving out the remainder of his final term. At the age of 91, Hall was in a car accident in October while he was back in Texas for the weekend. He was airlifted to a hospital but recovered after suffering a hip injury and minor cuts and bruises.

Hall's wife, Mary Ellen Murphy, died in 2008 at the age of 83. The two were married in 1944. They are survived by their three sons, Hampton, Brett and Blakely.",498,Fox News,Former GOP Texas Rep. Ralph Hall dead at age 95
"It will reduce growth and take money from middle-class investors.

Congressmen Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Peter DeFazio of Oregon have introduced the Wall Street Tax Act, a crass and poorly constructed tax on financial transactions. More specifically, the bill aims to charge a 10-basis-point (0.1 percent) fee on all financial transactions (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.). The bill is backed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fact that I guess is relevant because we are supposed to know her take on everything under the sun. So far the only Democratic presidential candidate to publicly back this bill is Senator Kristen Gillibrand of New York, though Bernie Sanders backed a similar bill in 2015.

What does this mean for investors? The good news, for now, is that it means nothing, because it is going nowhere. The bill will not have anywhere near unanimous Democratic support (there remain some Democrats who can count, and who are not determined to destroy the American financial economy), and it certainly wouldn't have Republican support to get through the Senate, let alone overcome a presidential veto. However, the bill may very well have life in a post-2020 world if the Democrats consolidate power, and it is worth understanding why a ""tax on high-frequency trading"" is no such thing at all. Rather, this is a tax on middle-class investors.

Like the 3 percent wealth tax Elizabeth Warren is proposing, and the 70 percent top marginal rate the aforementioned AOC is proposing, this financial-transactions tax seeks to appeal to the class-envy strain of American culture. The cleverly titled ""Wall Street Tax Act"" plays to the angst so many have about the very concept of Wall Street. But beyond the politics of it, or misguided Marxian impulses, let's look at the actual substance of the bill:

""Wall Street has made record profits from high risk trades,"" says Congressman Schatz. It would be difficult to imagine ten words containing more nonsense. Equity trading as a percentage of Wall Street profits is at a generational low, and the marginalization of trading fees is a result of market forces, not government intervention. But just what are the ""high-risk trades"" they refer to? Bid/ask spreads are the tightest they have been in history, and markets now enjoy the most modernized, transparent, sophisticated, manageable trading environment we have ever seen (this applies to fixed-income and equities). Market forces themselves are prone to volatility, because, well, they are market forces. But what this systemic risk of ""high-risk trades"" is, we are never told.

Let's just cut to the chase beyond the inane pretext for the bill. Who really pays the 10-basis-point fee on every single transaction? Middle-class investors do. A $10 additional charge on a $10,000 stock purchase adds 200 percent to the average trading cost of $4.95 per trade. The massive volume of stocks and bonds bought by mutual-fund investors, 401(k) participants, pension funds, and other investors with an average balance of below $250,000 will marginally suffer the most. The American Retirement Association estimates that the net effect of this bill would be to increase 401(k) expenses by 31 percent.

Less liquidity in the marketplace (as France experienced in 2012 with a similar misguided bill) hurts everyone. It creates incentives for sophisticated investors to move their trading to overseas exchanges, avoiding the tax and taking business away from American capital markets. No matter how small and deceptive the tax may be, there is only one source that the revenue comes from in this tax construct: From the investment returns of American investors. When compounded over many years, the result is meaningful and dangerous. This represents a reallocation of resources from where it is most needed (in capital formation and investment productivity) to where it is least needed (in government redistribution).

History has taught us that these types of initiatives raise less revenue than promised and have worse side effects than predicted. The Wall Street Tax Act is a tax on Main Street investors and should be treated as such.",499,nationalreview.com,All You Need to Know about the Misguided Financial-Transactions Tax | National Review
"He asked the Supreme Court to acknowledge his First Amendment rights, and it did

An average guy, provoked enough, can accomplish things that are above average.

Mark Janus is such a guy. Provoked by what he believed was a bald violation of his First Amendment rights, he took action to see them protected. And he prevailed. Big time, as an average guy might say.

His name, italicized, will live on now in legal textbooks and amicus curiae footnotes, will be cited at length in law-school seminars and oral arguments, will be uttered with contempt in union headquarters, with respect in conservative gatherings. And it will be classified under ""landmark."" Maybe even give birth to a phrase, ""Janus rights.""

Last June, in Mark Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, commonly known as Janus v. AFSCME, the United States Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that public-sector unions may not automatically enroll workers as members and collect fees from them. Janus was a loss for labor. A big loss. And it was a major -- even surprising, and far-reaching -- victory for conservatives and First Amendment champions.

Mark Janus describes himself as ""just an average guy, a middle-class person who goes to work every day."" And work is where this saga of jurisprudence, of constitutional rights, of modern-day politics and union power, all begins. A lifelong resident of Springfield, Ill., Janus, a down-to-earth civic-minded citizen (he is an Eagle Scout), graduated in 1975 from Illinois College, a business-administration major whose career path meandered. He worked for his dad's beauty-supply company and then at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, where his duties centered on economic-development small-business loans.

Janus soon returned to the private sector, as an accountant for a printing company and then in his own spiral-binding business, which he eventually sold. Then followed an encore as a government employee.

And it was there, working as a child-support specialist for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, that the worm turned. Central to all that happened in this saga is this fact: Employee Janus was not a member of the office's overseeing union, Local 2600 of AFSCME.

So Janus was surprised ""when I got my first paycheck,"" he tells National Review. It was unlike his first job with Illinois -- ""This time I saw a deduction for union dues."" It happened automatically. ""During the normal intake process when I started working, no one in HR said anything about unions, about having to pay fees or dues. And I never joined the union."" He inquired of his colleagues: What gives? ""I was told 'Everyone had to pay in some manner' and 'It's just mandatory.' At the time I thought -- that's just the way it is. I have no choice.""

The absence of choice was the rule. The reason: In its Abood v. Detroit Board of Education decision (1977), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that teachers who objected to being forced by state law to pay fees to a union that engaged in political activities they opposed nonetheless had an obligation to pay, and as a condition of employment.

The Court's decision affirmed the situation in which Mark Janus found himself years later: In many non-right-to-work states, a public-sector union may operate on behalf of all employees, whether union members or not, and, if it does, nonmembers pay ""agency fees"" through paycheck deductions. All that cash is then used to bankroll the union's activities related to, as the Court wrote in Abood, ""collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment purposes.""

But: What about the free-speech complaints of the Abood plaintiffs? Through the agency fees, their money was underwriting advocacy for politics they disdained. The Court, ruling that there was a legitimate First Amendment point here, enacted what it thought was a reasonable compromise, stating that the Constitution relieved the plaintiffs from being assessed that slice of ""charges, dues, or assessments"" related to a union's political activities.

As compromises go, Abood's was destined for failure: Unstated, and never emerging over the decades, was any formula for truly quantifying the percentage of a union's political activity and then reimbursing nonmembers for it. There were also unanswered, sticky questions. Who does the slicing? What size should the slice be? Who says what is or isn't political activity? Abood offered no workable way to untangle the rat's nest of money, union activities, and free speech.

Mark Janus was 24 years old when Abood was decided. More than 30 years after the decision was handed down, the way to offset compulsory union fees to account for objectionable political speech remained unsettled. Now in his second Illinois-government job, Janus found every pay period repeating an injustice: ""As time went on, I saw more and more of this money going to AFSCME. For all intents and purposes, it was a political organization."" Janus could not shake his irritation as he connected the dots of complicity between his union-collected fees, the state political power structure, and the fiscal straits of Illinois.

What was an average guy to do? Simply stew?

Not this one. Says Janus, who had no partisan affiliation, ""I didn't see my union working totally for the good of Illinois government. For years it supported candidates who put Illinois into its current budget and pension crisis. Government unions have pushed for government spending that made the state's fiscal situation worse. How is that good for the people of the state? Or, for that matter, for my fellow union members who face the threat of layoffs or their pension funds someday running dry?""

Unless he opted for unemployment, Janus was essentially a co-conspirator through his paycheck, dunned every month. ""I felt I was totally powerless and in a way violated. Here was all this money coming out of my check month after month, and the union was not paying any attention to my beliefs.""

Nor was the union providing information: ""I did talk to my union steward about this but always received such a nebulous response."" Janus said he pressed to learn how the union was spending the fees and dues: ""There was no real breakdown. I asked around, 'Where is this all going?' And the answer was 'Well, we really can't tell you.' There was a total lack of transparency.""

His mounting frustration, though, wasn't centered on a pilfered paycheck. It focused on his First Amendment rights. ""Our Bill of Rights is crystal clear on the topic,"" he wrote in an op-ed for the Springfield State Journal-Register in September 2017. ""The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of association. I should not be forced into association with a union that claims to represent my interests when it really doesn't.""

The average guy had had enough. In 2015, Janus got in touch with the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center, a respected public-interest litigation group that fights for free speech and other rights. He had decided to seek legal redress through the courts. ""I found out about the people at Liberty Justice Center. I learned about how they had fought for this cause. So we started a dialogue, and over the process we determined that we would file a case, that we would sue AFSCME.""

So would the state's new Republican governor. Bruce Rauner, who won election in 2014 in part by campaigning against union excesses, issued an executive order to halt the collection of ""agency fees"" from non-union members and then filed a federal lawsuit against AFSCME and other unions to have the Illinois law mandating ""fair share contract provisions"" tossed out for violating First Amendment rights. This was precisely Janus's beef. Rauner's suit was an ideal vehicle for him.

Together with two other state employees, Marie Quigley and Brian Trygg, Janus joined as a plaintiff to Rauner's suit. A federal judge then ruled that the governor lacked standing, leaving the trio, which became an uno when Quigley opted out and Trygg was deemed to have a conflict.

Within months, Janus was the sole plaintiff in what had turned into a major federal case, albeit one with welcome competition in that category. In July 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Rebecca Friedrichs, an elementary-school teacher who sued the California Teachers Association on similar grounds. A victory in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association would likely satisfy Janus's objectives. Oral argument was heard in January 2016. Conservatives got hopeful. Unions got scared.

And then Justice Antonin Scalia died. So too did the Friedrichs suit, when a divided court, in a 4-4 tie, put an end to the teacher's campaign.

That made Janus the leading federal case to redress the violation of government workers' First Amendment rights. Would the Supreme Court hear it? In late 2017, cert was granted, and the next February the Court held oral argument. With Justice Neil Gorsuch having replaced Scalia, hopes reemerged that the Court might overturn not only the state statute but also the unworkable Abood precedent. That was precisely the request made by Janus's counsel, led by William Messenger of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, when the Court agreed to hear the case in late 2017:

Abood is offensive to the First Amendment. It permits the government to compel employees to subsidize an advocacy group's political activity: namely, speaking to the government to influence governmental policies. . . . Abood is inconsistent with this Court's precedents that subject instances of compelled speech and association to heightened constitutional scrutiny; Abood's framework is unworkable and does not protect employee rights; and no reliance interests justify retaining Abood. The Court should abandon Abood and instead follow its precedents that subject compelled speech and association to heightened First Amendment scrutiny.

That, and more, happened: The Alito-written Janus ruling the Court issued on June 27, 2018, was broader and deeper than many had anticipated.

Vincent Vernuccio, a senior fellow at Mackinac Center for Public Policy and a labor-policy expert, describes Janus as ""a tremendous victory"" and says that ""the size of the victory was a big surprise to most followers of the Court."" Because of the Friedrichs vote in 2016, they felt reasonably sure that in Janus ""the Court was going to uphold the First Amendment rights of public employees."" However, ""Alito went further and said that all public employees must opt in to their union"" if they want to belong to it, rather than being automatically enrolled and allowed to opt out.

This ""affirmative consent"" requirement ""breaks new ground,"" Vernuccio says. It's unambiguous. Now a government employee must, essentially, tell an employer, ""Yes, I want to pay dues or agency fees"" before funds can be deducted from his pay. The days of automatic withholding ended along with Abood. The unions' reliable money spigot was reliable no longer. The Janus decision could impoverish unions if ""affirmative consent"" in practice severely reduces the revenue they collect from dues. The political consequences are immense.

Unions are fighting the efforts by conservative groups to inform government employees -- both union members and nonmembers -- of their new Janus rights. Indeed, AFSCME and other government-employee unions, including the powerful Service Employees International Union (SEIU), were reacting even before Janus was handed down. For unions, the Friedrichs decision had been at best a temporary win: Donald Trump's election, and Gorsuch's nomination and confirmation, meant that a defeat of some kind, and likely sooner rather than later, was in the offing.

In Connecticut, where government unions are considered the most powerful special interest, the Yankee Institute for Public Policy is directly informing workers of their Janus rights. ""We genuinely believe in workers' rights -- each individual worker should have the right to choose the arrangement that suits him or her best,"" says Yankee president Carol Platt Liebau. ""If it means being part of a government union, fine. But if the government unions aren't serving their members well -- and many are not -- those workers should be aware of their rights. They should know that they don't have to hand over a significant portion of their paychecks to an organization that may not be looking out for them and [in which], in most cases, they didn't have any voice in choosing their representative.""

The pushback -- in the offices of government workers and in the statehouse -- has been fierce. Despite the Janus ruling, AFSCME Council 4 is denying government employees in Connecticut their opt-out, never mind seeking their affirmative consent. Among the unions' denial tactics are setting limited windows during which opt-outs can be requested.

And then there is intimidation. ""Employees have shared stories with us that illustrate why they are hesitant to ask their HR, payroll department, or union representative about their Janus rights,"" Liebau adds. ""After these employees raised a question or asked to resign from their union, they found themselves singled out on proclamations posted to bulletin boards in their workplace. Often union reps share the names of workers who have left the union.""

Elsewhere, there is evidence -- numerical, not anecdotal -- that conservative efforts to inform workers are having an impact.

Freedom Foundation, with offices in Washington State, California, and Oregon, has quarterbacked campaigns to apprise workers of their Janus rights. In February, Oregon officials reported that SEIU-represented employees declined from 21,666 to 16,108 from June through the end of December. Twenty-six percent of Oregon state workers represented by SEIU 503 no longer pay dues. A fluke? No. The Oregon School Employees Association, representing 22,000 non-teacher school workers, has seen a dramatic 31 percent drop in dues-paying members in the eight months since Janus was decided.

The union pushback is determined, widespread, and influential in many state legislatures, where, says Maxford Nelsen, Freedom Foundation's director of labor policy, government unions have strong allies. ""What we're seeing on the West Coast is an effort in state legislatures to shield unions from the effects of Janus and the loss of membership. It's really being taken to extremes. For example, there is legislation introduced in Oregon that would require direct taxpayer funding of unions. That shows the lengths and depths to which legislatures will go to prop up this special interest.""

Nelsen has been focused on a Washington State bill that would maximize union-dues collection and shield unions from liabilities, including criminal, in their attempts to counter Janus. ""This bill would protect labor unions, making them completely exempt from liability related to union-dues collections. If this bill became law, unions could use any methods, even illegal, to collect dues and fees, but employees would be prevented from seeking redress before court or state agencies. A union or its representative could break state law -- someone could engage in, say, a criminal act of forgery of an employee opt-in form.""

AFSCME has particular contempt for Freedom Foundation. In a nuance-free video, Don't Fall for the Freedom Foundation's Lies, AFSCME president Lee Saunders charges that ""a whole network of shadowy groups funded by CEOs and billionaires is trying to scam us. . . . Don't be fooled: The Freedom Foundation doesn't fight for our freedom; it stands for the freedom of corporations to rig the economy in their own favor."" He gives AFSCME members their orders: ""If they contact you, report it at once. . . . If you get one of their emails, delete it. If they call you, hang up. If they come to your door, slam it in their faces.""

Another AFSCME bogeyman is State Policy Network, the collective of right-of-center state think tanks dedicated to personal freedom. Even before the Court ruled, AFSCME launched a campaign to deride SPN's efforts to promote Janus through the legal system. On its website, AFSCME described SPN as purveying ""misinformation to workers"" and pushing its ""agenda through the courts. The latest example of that agenda is the Janus case."" The ""billionaires and corporate CEOs"" behind Janus ""have been trying to smash"" the freedom of workers ""to join together in strong unions and build strength through numbers.""

So it goes. And so it will continue to go. ""Janus, as significant and as important as it was,"" says Nelsen, is just a first step. ""If the only thing that ever happens on this front is the Janus decision, then there won't be much change."" He predicts years of court and legislative actions to defend workers' First Amendment rights. ""We need to make sure that the principles acknowledged in the ruling are enacted. There's a lot of follow-up work to do.""

As for the man whose name will live on in italics, Mark Janus, union members at his former job threw a party when he left. They didn't invite him. Working now for Liberty Justice Center, Janus plans to be in on the follow-up, no matter the lumps. He's taken plenty and expects plenty more: ""There are a lot of people on the other side, on social media, looking at me like a pariah. Like I am backed by Big Money and Dark Money people.""

""Initially I was na√Øve about the reaction,"" he admits. ""But now, I am meeting union people who come up to me and who are telling me their stories, stories that are totally unbelievable about how they are treated. How their unions totally ignore them and are not responsive.""

Which inspires him to carry on. ""The bottom-line goal here is to free government workers from being forced to financially support government unions. . . . This case has not been about ending collective bargaining, or ending unions or the rights of unions. It's been about giving workers a choice.""

"And by courting them, the GOP can demonstrate that their principles are universal

In November 2015, then-radio-host Stephen Bannon was interviewing then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump. During the interview, Trump expressed concern that, owing to American immigration laws, many foreign students attending elite American universities were being forced to return home after graduation. ""We have to be careful of that, Steve,"" said Trump. ""You know, we have to keep our talented people in this country.""

""Um,"" Bannon replied.

""I think you agree with that,"" Trump added. ""Do you agree with that?""

Bannon paused, and said, ""When two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think . . . A country is more than an economy. We're a civic society.""

The Bannon-Trump exchange highlights the most significant division within the conservative movement today.

In one camp are demographic pessimists such as Bannon. They presume that Americans of non-European heritage are hostile to conservatism and think we should oppose the increasing racial diversification of America because it will move the country to the left.

In the other camp are demographic optimists. They believe that conservative values are universal values, shared by people of all races, and that non-European immigrants can add substantial value to America. They argue that the conservative movement must find a way to attract members of minority groups if it is to live up to its universal moral claims and thrive in a more diverse America.

One oft-ignored group will determine who wins this debate: Asian Americans.

Asian Americans are a diverse lot, representing many different nationalities, races, cultures, and religions. But in general, they favor free enterprise, traditional family values, and a vigorous foreign policy. And yet Asians are increasingly turning away from the Republican party and identifying with the Left. Why?

The loyalty of blacks -- and the growing allegiance of Hispanics -- to the Democratic party is widely discussed in conservative and Republican circles. Some conservatives have concluded that it is futile to court these voters because, it is said, prevailing trends in their communities are culturally and economically incompatible with conservative values.

Black and Hispanic voters suffer from higher rates of poverty, goes the theory, and therefore have an economic interest in supporting the expansion of the welfare state. Furthermore, illegitimate births have become more common in black and Hispanic households, a trend that -- again, according to the theory -- makes blacks and Hispanics uninterested in conservative family values.

""Illegitimacy has become completely normalized among [social workers'] Hispanic clients,"" wrote Heather Mac Donald, author of The Diversity Delusion, in a 2006 article for National Review. ""Far from exercising a brake on the erosion of traditional values, . . . the growing Hispanic population will provide the impetus for more government alternatives to personal responsibility.""

A related -- but somewhat contradictory -- argument made by the pessimists is one of civilizational incompatibility: that non-European immigrants are fundamentally ill equipped to uphold American values. By this logic, it doesn't matter whether families are intact or incomes are low. As Steve Bannon put it in his radio interview, it's not merely the non-European immigrants from broken or low-income homes who undermine ""civic society,"" but also the wealthy, married, capitalist ones.

Similarly, Michael Anton, writing under a pseudonym for the Claremont Review of Books, has argued that ""the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle.""

Laura Ingraham, on her Fox News show, said, ""In some parts of the country, it does seem that the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people. And they're changes that none of us ever voted for and most of us don't like. From Virginia to California, we see stark examples of how radically in some ways the country has changed. . . . This is exactly what socialists like [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez want: eventually diluting and overwhelming your vote with the votes of others, who aren't -- let's face it -- too big on Adam Smith and the Federalist Papers. . . . This is a national emergency.""

These two ideas are powerful in conservative circles in part because they are self-flattering. Our inability to attract minority groups, we tell ourselves, is due to the moral superiority of our values and their lack of interest in self-reliance, hard work, and family formation.

Demographic pessimists of the 19th and early 20th centuries made similar arguments about German, Irish, Italian, and Eastern European immigrants. Back then, those countries were not suffused with democracy or individual liberty or economic freedom; that is, after all, why millions left for America in the first place. The same holds true today for so many immigrants to the U.S. who flee authoritarian countries precisely because they crave political and economic liberty.

But plenty of Asians come to America from democratic countries. South Korea and Japan rank higher than the United States on The Economist's ""Democracy Index,"" which grades countries on civil liberties and tolerance for political opponents. India has been a parliamentary democracy since 1948 -- that is to say, for significantly longer than Spain, Portugal, East Germany, and Poland. Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan all rank higher than the United States on the Heritage Foundation's 2019 ""Index of Economic Freedom.""

Indeed, Asian Americans provide a test case for the claims of the demographic pessimists. Is Bannon right that Asians are too different from Europeans to contribute to our society? Or are conservatives in part responsible for the Left's growing appeal among Asians?

In just two generations, Asian Americans have become America's most successful ethnic group. As a share of the U.S. population, Asians have grown from barely 1 percent in the early 1960s to more than 6 percent today. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Asian-American population grew by nearly 50 percent. The Asian vote is now large enough to swing elections in Virginia and Nevada.

If conservative values really are the values of family, personal responsibility, education, and hard work, the most conservative demographic group in America is Asians. The divorce rate for non-Hispanic whites is 40 percent; for Asians, it is 21 percent. The teen birth rate for whites is 17 percent; for Asian Americans, it is 8 percent. The illegitimacy rate for whites is 29 percent; for Asian Americans, it is 16 percent.

Asians also value merit and hard work, just as conservatives do. Take educational attainment: Thirty-six percent of white Americans have a college degree, while 54 percent of Asian Americans do. Asian families push their children hard to score at the top of standardized tests and achieve sterling grade-point averages. They rightly prize the great benefits of being educated at our world-beating universities. Opposition to race-based affirmative action at Harvard University, the University of California, and New York City schools has brought out Asians in support of conservative arguments for meritocracy and against race-based quotas.

Asian Americans are among the most successful participants in the American economy; they compose the highest-earning ethnic group in the United States, and one of the highest-educated. In 2015, median household income for whites was $63,000 a year. For Asians, it was $77,000.

Asians are more likely than whites to run a small business. When Asian families immigrate to the United States, they may at first lack proficiency in the English language or American social skills. They will not have immediate entr√©e into our elite cultural institutions or corporate networks. So they will often run motels, dry cleaners, convenience stores, and restaurants as a way to support themselves and their families. If the natural home of hard-working, tax-paying, family-forming Americans is the GOP, Asians should be voting overwhelmingly for Republicans.

And yet Asians have become a loyal component of the Democratic party. In the 1980s and 1990s, Asian Americans voted Republican. George H. W. Bush won the Asian vote in 1992 over Bill Clinton, 55-31. Bob Dole also beat Bill Clinton for the Asian vote, 48-43. But during the era of Barack Obama, Asians turned decisively away from the Republican party. In the 2012 elections, 76 percent of Asian voters turned out for President Obama: a higher proportion than did so among Hispanics, Jews, or single women, and second only to that of African Americans. In 2016, two-thirds of all Asian voters supported Hillary Clinton, again the second-highest proportion among demographic groups.

Democrats have rewarded this overwhelming support with an intransigent defense of policies that explicitly or implicitly discriminate against Asians. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disheartening use of race by elite universities to suppress Asian achievement.

In the early 20th century, Ivy League schools found that the use of admissions tests was leading to a rise in Jewish matriculants. By 1922, Jewish students constituted nearly 22 percent of Harvard College, up from 7 percent in 1900. This led to alarm among university administrators. Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell sought to rectify this ""problem"" by developing a ""holistic"" admissions process that deemphasized test scores. ""We can reduce the number of Jews by talking about other qualifications than those of admission examinations,"" Lowell wrote, expressing the view that the ideal proportion of Jews was about 15 percent.

Harvard and other universities changed their attitude toward Jews after World War II. As Americans learned of the Holocaust, it became untenable for universities to continue to discriminate against Jews in their admissions practices. But elite universities never dropped the ""holistic"" admissions system. Today, that system is used against Asian Americans.

Under the pressure of a lawsuit, Harvard disclosed in summer 2018 that Asians would make up 43 percent of the student body if academic considerations alone dictated admissions. This seems about right, given external statistics. In 2012, Asians represented 13 percent of California's population but 59 percent of California's National Merit semifinalists: those whose scores on the PSAT were in the top 0.5 percent of all test-takers. In Texas, in 2010, Asians were 3.8 percent of the population but more than 25 percent of the National Merit semifinalists.

But even though, on average, Asians rated the highest in Harvard's admissions system for academics and extra-curricular activities, they also had the lowest score for ""personality,"" which includes traits such as ""humor, sensitivity, grit, [and] leadership."" This is ""holistic"" admissions at work.

By dinging Asian applicants' personalities, Harvard was able to limit Asians to 26 percent of the class; the college then made ""demographic"" adjustments, which further limited the Asian proportion to 23 percent.

Moreover, Asians are a rapidly growing share of the U.S. population and of the highest-achieving college applicants. But their share of the Harvard freshman class has remained magically constant for decades, ranging from 17 to 19 percent. In other words, if Harvard is not discriminating against Asians, Asians' personalities have deteriorated over time to make up for their rising academic achievement.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld Harvard's racially discriminatory ""holistic"" system; every Supreme Court justice appointed by Bill Clinton or Barack Obama has voted to support race-based admissions programs in the name of ""diversity."" These Democratic appointees have been joined by enough Republicans to maintain the anti-Asian status quo.

Democratic legislators have also supported anti-Asian policies, especially in education. Democrats in California, for example, have sought repeatedly to overturn Proposition 209, which is the only law preventing state universities such as Berkeley and UCLA from resuming the use of race to suppress Asian admissions. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed ending the sole use of standardized testing to determine entrance into magnet schools such as Stuyvesant and Bronx Science, where Asians now constitute more than two-thirds of the student body. Calling the racial demographics of these schools a ""monumental injustice,"" the mayor declared: ""Can anyone defend this? Can anyone look the parent of a Latino or black child in the eye and tell them their precious daughter or son has an equal chance to get into one of their city's best high schools?"" When Asian groups protested, Richard Carranza, the city's schools chancellor, responded, ""I just don't buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admissions to these schools.""

While school admissions is a top-tier issue for Asians, disregarding it is not the only way in which Democratic leaders take Asian voters for granted. Although Asians earn high incomes and run the small businesses that suffer the most from growing government, Democrats have aggressively resisted Republican tax cuts and the Trump administration's deregulation initiative.

But Republicans deserve much of the blame for this state of affairs. Like past immigrants, many Asians first land in our largest cities: the ones that conservative pundits sometimes exclude from ""the real America."" The Republican party no longer seriously contests elections in the inner cities as it did in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when many Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans immigrated to the U.S. Asian Americans who rely on municipal government for safe streets, business licenses, and good schools may never meet a serious Republican politician. At naturalization ceremonies throughout the U.S., where new citizens pledge their allegiance to the flag, representatives from the Democratic Party are usually waiting outside to register them to vote. Republicans rarely are. It would come as no surprise if these immigrants -- especially those who have fled authoritarian governments -- got involved in local Democratic parties that appear to be their only avenue for civic engagement.

But the tension between Asians and conservatives may run deeper. For half a century, opponents of the Right have alleged that, while conservatives and Republicans claim to support universal values, in reality the Right's agenda is racist and sectarian.

Immigrants from Korea and China are among America's most fervent Evangelical Christians, but immigrants from India are more likely to be Hindu or secular in background. It is quite apparent to these communities that there are conservatives who view them with suspicion because their ancestry is not European or their faith not Christian, or simply because their rapid success has surpassed that of other Americans whose families have been here longer.

For demographic optimists within the conservative movement -- those who wish to show that ordered liberty is a universal principle that can make life better for everyone -- Asian Americans represent an ideal opportunity. A conservative and Republican coalition that includes Asians will gradually learn how to talk about its principles in a way that appeals to both nonwhites and non-Christians. Asians, in this way, could help Republicans learn how to appeal to all minorities.

On the flip side, it is hard to see how, if they cannot bring Asian Americans into their coalition, conservatives will ever rise above the perception -- or reality -- that their movement is solely a vehicle to advance white interests.

But if conservatives and Republicans are to win back the Asian vote, they must refresh their policy agenda and reform their political culture.

First, they should go beyond simple distaste for race-based affirmative action and prioritize the enactment of a workable replacement. It would be far more faithful to the Constitution to give an advantage to university applicants with lower socioeconomic status than to employ race-based quotas. It would also be more fair. While socioeconomic preferences might adversely affect high-income Asians relative to a purely academic standard, Asians would recognize that such an approach does not discriminate against their children on the basis of skin color. It would also not insult them, as does race-based affirmative action, by assuming that all Asians are monolithic in their views or experiences. Socioeconomic-status-based affirmative action would reinforce America's openness to merit and hard work and better reward those who overcame obstacles presented by poverty or family breakdown. Conservatives should be the ones upholding the principle that hard work and talent are more important than accidents of birth, wealth, or social networks.

Second, conservatives should learn from Canada and Australia and embrace a skills-based approach to immigration. Many Asians oppose illegal immigration for the same reasons that conservatives do: Most Asians came here legally and see illegal immigration as unfair -- to them. But Bannon-style restrictionists who seek to suppress all immigration -- both legal and illegal -- drive Asians away.

Conservatives may disagree about what the right scale of legal immigration would be. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the United States admits roughly 1 million people a year as permanent resident aliens. While some pessimists want to reduce that number to zero, many optimists ask: Would the character of a country of 325 million people really change if we admitted 2 million instead of 1?

Since pessimists and optimists still have to live together in the conservative movement and the Republican party, it would be best not to argue over the scale of legal immigration to the U.S. but rather to at least maintain it at current levels. Such a compromise would allow conservatives to focus on improving the quality of the immigrants the U.S. legally admits.

As Reihan Salam argues in his recently published book Melting Pot or Civil War: A Son of Immigrants Makes the Case against Open Borders, conservatives should urge a shift away from family-based immigration -- which currently dominates federal policy -- and toward an emphasis on immigrants' ability to support themselves and their families without relying on the safety net. This would help improve the economic welfare of those already here.

President Trump was on to something when he told Bannon that the U.S. ought to change policy to persuade foreigners who receive advanced degrees at American universities to stay. In his book, Salam reviews evidence showing that the most self-sufficient immigrants are those with college and graduate degrees. Conservatives should support offering permanent residence, with a pathway toward citizenship, to every law-abiding foreigner who graduates from a U.S. college or university.

Conservatives could similarly advance preferences for those who serve in the U.S. armed forces, help our troops or diplomats abroad, or offer important economic skills. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts that we will have a shortage of 40,000 to 120,000 doctors by 2030; the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a shortage of 1.1 million nurses; placement firms estimate that 3 million available STEM jobs are going unfilled. If our nation suffers from shortages of doctors, nurses, engineers, computer scientists, teachers, and emergency responders, conservatives should deploy the immigration system to help meet those needs. Otherwise, that knowledge and skill will stay abroad, where it may even benefit our foreign rivals.

In purely demographic terms, both the optimists and the pessimists are right. A Republican party composed solely of white voters will not survive the 21st century. Even if the U.S. were to enact what many pessimists fantasize about -- a total moratorium on future immigration -- it would make little difference. Since 2013, the majority of new births in America have been to minority or mixed-race parents. Generation Z and whatever we end up calling the generations that follow will all grow up in an ethnically and racially diverse America, as Millennials already have.

If the conservative movement and the Republican party want to attract Asians, the most important thing is to want to include Asians in their coalition. Playing hard-to-get doesn't work in politics the way it does in romance. Conservatives often act as if it were up to members of minority groups to realize how wonderful conservatism is on their own. In the real world, it is conservatives' job to make the case to black, Hispanic, and Asian voters that conservative policies will improve their lives.

Canada provides a roadmap for how the Right can build a coalition that includes Asian immigrants. In 2006, Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper convinced one of his deputies, Jason Kenney, to take on the party's immigration portfolio in Parliament. Kenney's orders: Help integrate new immigrants into Canadian culture and into the Conservative party. ""I understood that I would have to be everywhere at all times,"" Kenney has recalled. ""Personal contact is crucial for new immigrants.""

Kenney spent the next decade crisscrossing the country, meeting with Korean community leaders in Vancouver one day, Sikh celebrants in Ontario the next, and Chinese immigrants in Ottawa the day after that. In 2009, a Chinese shopkeeper caught a shoplifter in the act and tied him up before calling the police. After the thief was arrested, he had the gumption to file assault charges against the shopkeeper, for tying him up. Kenney learned about the controversy by reading Chinese-language newspapers. In response, he helped draft a bill allowing shopkeepers to use ""reasonable force"" against thieves and intruders.

The newest Canadians, Kenney learned, were culturally more conservative than the average Canadian of European stock. And they wanted, above all, to be heard: to be treated as if their concerns were of equal importance to those of other voters. Because the natural predisposition of politicians is to focus on existing constituencies rather than new ones, those such as Kenney, who did focus on new constituents, won their loyalty. Immigrants in Toronto's suburbs drove Conservatives to a sweeping victory in Canada's 2011 federal elections.

The addition of immigrants to the Canadian conservative coalition didn't hand Tories a permanent majority. Harper and company lost in 2015 to Justin Trudeau's Liberals. But the Conservative party of Canada has shown how, contrary to claims of pessimists in America, non-European immigrants can strengthen conservatism in a Western nation. Kenney and colleagues didn't appeal to Asians by moving left but by applying conservative principles to the problems that Asian Canadians were facing.

Just as with the Conservatives in Canada, the survival of the GOP hinges on its ability to attract a more diverse electorate. But as we have seen, American pessimists are not persuaded by arguments of practical politics. They argue that it will not profit the GOP to gain the minority vote but lose its European soul.

The Republican party, however, was founded in 1854 to establish the principle of liberty and justice for all Americans, regardless of race. It was a remarkable principle, given the practical politics of the time. Republicans, in effect, were promising to diminish the economic and political power of whites -- that is to say, voters -- in order to liberate nonvoting blacks from slavery.

In recent years, Republicans have lost their connection to that tradition. It is a problem they can overcome with a well-considered reform agenda and by doing the humble and uncomfortable work of courting people who are different from them. But most of all, it requires the conviction that conservative values can improve the lives of Americans of all races and creeds, and that Americans of non-European ancestry have just as much at stake in the survival of liberty as do the sons and daughters of the American Revolution.

As recently as the 1980s, these views were conventional among Republicans. Ronald Reagan, in his last speech as president, said, ""I think it's fitting to leave one final thought, an observation about the country which I love. It was stated best in a letter I received not long ago. A man wrote me and said: 'You can go to live in France, but you cannot become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan, but you cannot become a German, a Turk, or Japanese. But anyone, from any corner of the earth, can come to live in America and become an American.'""

This is the principle that once made America exceptional. Is it still?",501,nationalreview.com,The Republican Party Needs Asian Voters
"Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow in military history at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and professor emeritus of classics at California State University, Fresno. The author of more than two dozen well-received books on topics ranging from the ancient world to the modern, Hanson lives in Selma, California, on a working farm that has been in his family for five generations. It's an experience that's given him strong views on subjects like illegal immigration, which has touched his life directly.

He opens his latest volume, The Case for Trump, in the year 2015, when Democratic and Republican strategists believed the country was becoming less industrialized and more digital, that new demographics -- encouraged by open-border immigration proponents -- would produce waves of new voters, and that the number of red-state voters was shrinking significantly. That meant gearing successful political pitches to the new political realities -- globalism, open borders, identity politics, and other ""woke"" concerns. Then Donald Trump came down the escalator in his eponymous building, gave ""the strangest presidential candidate's announcement speech in memory,"" and made ""ready for the beginning of a nonending war with the press and civil strife within his party. He postured like Caesar easily crossing the forbidden Rubicon and forcing an end to the old politics as usual.""

Trump would play, Hanson writes, ""an ancient role of the crude, would-be savior who scares even those who would invite him in to solve intractable problems that their own elite leadership could not. Trump was not that much different from the off-putting tragic hero -- from Homer's Achilles and Sophocles's Ajax to modern cinema's Wild Bunch and Dirty Harry."" In this crisply written and forceful analysis, Hanson argues that Trump has met those intractable problems head-on, shaking an establishment running on empty to its core, and, during his first two years, establishing an unparalleled record of solid presidential accomplishment.

Hanson takes us through the campaign again, commenting on how effectively Trump beat his primary opponents -- 11 well-qualified Republicans -- and then Hillary Clinton with her billion-dollar war chest and most of the pollsters, establishment, academy, and major media behind her. Trump threw her badly off stride -- just as he did his fellow Republicans -- with an unorthodox campaign and a ""Homeric use of adjectival epithets."" In the process, he blew up the approved scripts for campaigning, speaking, and debating, earning enemies among opponents and the media that covered him.

Paradoxically, one of the reasons for Trump's continued popularity is the nearly monolithic hostility of the media, even segments of the conservative media. Hanson, a frequent contributor to conservative publications, aligns himself with no clique or faction, although he seems mildly contemptuous of Never Trumpers. ""In the conservative old days,"" he writes, ""a Republican president could call upon New York and Washington pundits and insiders -- in the present generation names like David Brooks, David Frum, Jonah Goldberg, Bill Kristol, Bret Stephens, or George Will -- for kitchen cabinet advice. But now they were among Trump's fiercest critics.""

And in some cases, they have been among the most tasteless. When Melania Trump, recovering from kidney surgery, dropped briefly from sight, ""Never-Trumper David Frum wondered whether Trump had struck his wife and sought to cover up the ensuing crime."" Frum wrote: ""Suppose President Trump punched the First Lady in the White House (federal property = federal jurisdiction), then ordered the Secret Service to conceal the assault?""

Other Never Trumpers were less nasty, although the objective -- discrediting Trump and hoping for his removal -- remained steady. From the day Trump was elected, Hanson writes, ""David Brooks reassured his depressed readers that Trump would likely either resign or be removed from office before his first year was over."" Nor has that hope faded. Recently we learned that top officials in the FBI had seriously discussed removing him from office -- some might call it a coup.

""Never before in the history of the presidency,"" Hanson writes, ""had a commander in chief earned the antipathy of the vast majority of the media, much of the career establishments of both political parties, the majority of the holders of the nation's accumulated personal wealth, and the permanent federal bureaucracy."" The deep state and media despised him ""because they were often one and the same thing.""

During previous presidencies, with the notable exception of Richard Nixon's, the media generally observed an unofficial gentlemen's agreement, holding back stories about JFK's sexual escapades, for example, and LBJ's use of his office to increase his wealth. With Nixon, the gloves came off early after he failed to end the Vietnam war during his first term, even though his Democratic predecessors were fully responsible for it.

But thanks to an extraordinary speech on the responsibilities of the media written by Pat Buchanan and delivered by Vice President Spiro Agnew in Des Moines, the press pulled back for a time. Nixon ended the war, and with the overwhelming support of those working-class voters Hillary Clinton would later call ""Deplorables,"" won a landslide victory in 1972. Ronald Reagan would again demonstrate the electoral power of the Deplorables in 1980.

At the end of two years, this base of support for Trump remains solid. This is in part, Hanson notes, due to Trump's recognition that ""the America 'era' was not ending, but at that time enjoying the strongest GDP growth, job reports, energy production, business and consumer confidence, and foreign policy successes in fifteen years."" The latest figures show that this administration's economic policies have resulted in the highest number of job openings ever recorded in the United States, with more women and minorities employed than ever before.

Moreover, Hanson adds, ""It was hard to see how U.S relations with key allies or deterrent stances against enemies were not improved since the years of the Obama situation...no more na√Øve Russian reset. China was on notice that its trade cheating was no longer tolerable. The asymmetrical Iran deal was over. And the United States was slowly squeezing...a nuclear North Korea.""

How does it end? At the moment, the McGovernite field of Democrats offers little threat to Trump's reelection in 2020. But reelection or no, perhaps Henry Kissinger, quoted by Hanson, best sums up what Donald Trump may come to represent: ""I think Trump may be one of those figures in history who appears from time to time to mark the end of an era and to force it to give up its old pretense.""",502,The American Conservative,A Classicist Makes the Case for Trump
"'Jeopardy!' host Alex Trebek released a YouTube video on Wednesday revealing the news that he's been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

The Media Research Center accused CNN's Chris Cuomo of politicizing Alex Trebek's cancer diagnosis by praising the ""Jeopardy!"" host for putting facts first during a time of ""rampant truth abuse in our politics.""

Trebek revealed in a YouTube video Wednesday night that he has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The ""Cuomo Prime Time"" namesake then made ""veiled references to President Trump"" and ""used the news to promote CNN's empty slogan"" when covering the news, according to MRC analyst Nicholas Fondacaro.

'JEOPARDY!' HOST ALEX TREBEK SAYS HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 4 PANCREATIC CANCER

""In a time that is all about what is keeping us apart, we got tough news today about someone who has always brought America together, literally for decades,"" Cuomo said. ""Trebek is a major asset to our culture, not just to the game show. In a time of shallow beliefs and rampant truth abuse in our politics and beyond, every night he makes facts first.""

Fondacaro wrote that ""Cuomo treats his show as a prosecutor's argument and courtroom against President Trump"" and feels his message to Trebek was no exception.

""Seemingly every night, Cuomo uses his show to rail against the President with suggestions he's tearing us apart and poisoning the dialogue with lies and misinformation. So, given that blatant history, it's clear that Cuomo exploiting Trebek's cancer diagnosis to score political points,"" Fondacaro wrote.

CNN ACCUSED BY NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS OF LACKING DIVERSITY

Fondacaro noted that Cuomo ""has a history keeping nothing sacred and away from politics,"" pointing to a Nov. 2018 segment in which he managed to politicize Thanksgiving.

Cuomo also referenced that the ""Jeopardy!"" host puts ""facts first,"" which is CNN's tagline for its ad campaign that declares apples are superior to bananas. ""Cuomo Prime Time"" is typically CNN's most-watched program but it struggles compared to other cable news networks. During the month of February, ""Cuomo Prime Time"" was CNN's highest-rated show but finished behind 14 FNC programs and eight MSNBC shows.

Meanwhile, Trebek's plan at this point is to at least work through and complete the show's ongoing season, TMZ reported. The season typically runs through the end of July. He has hosted the show since 1984.

"Top Talkers: The final six episode season of 'Games of Thrones' begins on April 14.

With ""Game of Thrones"" finally coming to an end, actor Kit Harington appeared on ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert to talk about how the show has shaped both pop culture and, in its way, politics over the past decade.

Harington has played Jon Snow since Season 1 of the hit HBO series. He's one of the few characters that can boast being around for the entirety of the cultural phenomenon that is ""Game of Thrones,"" something the late-night host noted during their interview.

FINAL SEASON OF HBO'S 'GAME OF THRONES' GETS PREMIERE DATE

""This show was a big cultural definer for the 2010s,"" Colbert said. ""So we can blame you for where we are now.""

""I got this theory that we kind of screwed the political landscape,"" Harington said.

""By making the Lannisters an acceptable form of ruling family?"" Colbert joked, referencing the blond-haired villains of the series.

""No, I just felt that certain political figures tried to emulate Joffrey, you know? And things went a little bit wrong.""

The star referenced the brutal King character played by Jack Gleeson that had fans cringing week-to-week at his twisted cruelty.

'GAME OF THRONES' STAR KIT HARINGTON REVEALED HE KEPT A STATUE OF HIMSELF FROM THE SET

Although the English actor did not mention President Donald Trump by name, Colbert seemed to drive the comparison home by suggesting that Harington ""got the hair right.""

Unfortunately for fans, the duo were only able to talk about the show in abstract or past terms. As audiences eagerly await the final six episodes of the series, the cast are under strict orders to avoid giving out any and all spoilers.

Harington revealed that he's even gotten in hot water for revealing secrets about the previous season to his wife, and former co-star, Rose Leslie.

Colbert brought up a story he'd heard in which Harington revealed the Season 7 ending to Leslie before it premiered, prompting her to stop speaking to him for two days.

"It's technically true that I've never been to CPAC, but the preposition ""to"" is doing almost all the work in this sentence.

What I mean is that I've never been a panelist or an invited speaker at CPAC. In fact, I've never even attended a panel or watched someone invited to speak at CPAC. That's because I've never bought a ticket to CPAC. I think I officially ""covered"" it for National Review one year -- or rather was one of a half dozen staff writers who went to National Harbor to cover it -- but for one reason or another I was never issued actual press credentials by its organizers and so could never make it past the gatekeepers into any of the sessions.

But the sessions aren't really the point of CPAC -- not for me, and not for many. And so I've spent a lot of time around CPAC, both that first year, when I came down from NRHQ in New York and tried to intercept interview subjects in hallways or elevators, and in the years since I moved to D.C.

Usually, I'll head over as the day's events are winding down and rendezvous with a motley band of colleagues, hacks, and fans -- yes, even rotating Happy Warriors have three or five fans! -- in the lobby of the Gaylord Hotel, or at some sponsored party, or in one of the sticky-floored bars that ring National Harbor. That part is always great, and indeed the principal value of the conference to me is that it makes far-flung acquaintances near-flung for a few days each year. I guess I do some ""networking,"" too, here and there.

All of this is to say that I think the criticisms of CPAC -- ""It's a circus!"" -- are a bit overblown. CPAC is not supposed to be a colloquium of botanists. CPAC is supposed to be fun, and circuses are great fun.

Don't get me wrong, CPAC is also deeply weird. It's held at a weird place, for one thing. National Harbor is a kind of Epcot Center built on the ashes of a burnt-down plantation house on a Potomac backwater. The Gaylord Convention Center, which sits at the center of a dozen blocks of antiseptic, centrally planned New Urbanist condos and boutiques, is surrounded by a mind-bogglingly huge glass dome that amplifies the kind of Truman Show vibe the whole place gives off. Every time you leave you get the feeling that if you were to come back the next morning you'd find just an empty lot with a few Diamond and Silk flyers blowing around the grounds like tumbleweeds.

And the people are weird, too. At least a lot of them are. There are plenty of earnest Young Republican types and pet-issue policy guys, to be sure, but there are also nuts of every flavor. They include both the professional class (the Swamp Things) and the civilians, the ordinary Americans who come from all over to see the medicine show. If you've been to both Republican and Democratic national conventions you know what I'm talking about. The joke about the DNC is that it's ""the welfare state on vacation,"" your local DMV at 10,000 times its size. The RNC is a much rowdier place, and this was as true when Romney was the nominee as it is now that a former WWE day player is running the party. For rank-and-file activists, the RNC is a place to cut loose, and in my head the median attendees will always be a married pair of Sun Belt small-business owners in matching denim vests replete with 15 pieces of NRA flair, sucking down frozen margs and mentioning a little too often that they've got a hot tub in their hotel room.

In other words, my kind of people!

CPAC is the same way, although with a more Beltway brand of decadence (one-third of the times I've been offered cocaine have been at CPAC). And again, that's all great. Education policy is important, but it's boring as hell, and you can't build a winning political coalition on white papers alone. American politics has always been a pastime, and pastimes have to be diverting. Tocqueville got this but Rush Limbaugh did too. So did Roger Ailes and Andrew Breitbart. So did Bill Maher and Jon Stewart and Samantha Bee and John Oliver and, well, everyone telling jokes on television after 10 p.m.

CPAC, then, isn't the problem. The problem is that the rest of politics has become like CPAC. The president's rallies, the performative press conferences and pay-per-view negotiations with Chuck and Nancy, are all indistinguishable from it. Throw a rock and you'll hit someone responsible for this. CNN as much as Fox, the White House as much as the Twitter meme-lords.

So let's let CPAC be a circus and devote our efforts instead to getting the bearded ladies and the elephants off the streets and back under the Big Top.",505,nationalreview.com,CPAC 2019 -- Conference Is the Party of the Right | National Review
"Unique and yet similarly absurd, the presidential candidates emerge

If you're having trouble keeping track of all the Democratic presidential candidates, it's understandable. To bring you up to speed, so far there's New Jersey senator Cory Booker, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, former housing-and-urban-development secretary Juli√°n Castro, Maryland representative John Delaney, Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, California senator Kamala Harris, Washington governor Jay Inslee, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. As of this writing, reports indicate former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper is in the running too.

We're still waiting on a decision from former vice president Joe Biden, Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, Montana governor Steve Bullock, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, Massachusetts representative Seth Moulton, former Texas representative Beto O'Rourke, Ohio representative Tim Ryan, and New York representative Eric Swalwell.

There's also Governor Eugene Gatling of Connecticut, Maryland senator David Palmer, Kansas senator Robert Kelly, Virginia congressman Nicholas Brody, Springfield mayor ""Diamond Joe"" Quimby -- wait, those figures are fictional. But one could be forgiven for nodding along to this ever-expanding list of names that sound vaguely familiar from the realm of politics of somewhere else in America.

The Democratic 2020 field is likely to have even more candidates than the Republican one in 2016, and even for political junkies some of these figures are pretty obscure.

A mega-field means that the candidates' debuts in the spotlight are shorter and they have a smaller window in which to define themselves to a Democratic electorate -- and in many cases, a national media -- that knows little to nothing about them. For example, Gillibrand announced her campaign back on January 15; she's been running for nearly two months. She's been to Iowa twice; the only thing that generated headlines outside the state was a stop in an Iowa City restaurant, where Gillibrand's remarks to supporters were interrupted by a woman trying to squeeze past the senator, declaring, ""I'm just going to get some ranch"" salad dressing.

Gillibrand keeps insisting she's ""running unabashedly as a mom,"" as if parenthood were a unique trait in presidential candidates or her primary qualification. Her family relations are of note in more specific ways; her maternal grandmother effectively ran the Albany machine, and her father was a powerful lobbyist. She's gotten a little bit of grief for having been, during Bush's second term, a centrist Democratic House member with outspoken, Trump-esque positions on illegal immigration and guns, positions she changed nearly overnight when appointed to take Hillary Clinton's Senate seat. (She changed her view on gay marriage because the governor who selected her, David Paterson, told her it was necessary for the appointment.)

Presidential candidates used to court voters; now the process is closer to speed dating: meeting plenty of potential suitors for several minutes apiece, then selecting one based almost entirely on first impressions. (Come to think of it, that sounds like a lot of primary debates.)

This instant-definition process can take some surprising turns. Klobuchar is in her third term as a little-noticed senator; she's mostly known for being ""Minnesota nice"" while giving the standard Democratic talking points on the Sunday shows. But now that she's a presidential candidate, former staffers are talking to the New York Times and revealing the woman behind the image, describing a psychotic boss who throws binders in rage, makes underlings attend to personal tasks such as washing her dishes, and once asked an aide to clean her comb after she'd used it as a salad fork. Employees in the office of the senator who supported legislation requiring private employers to provide paid sick days and paid family and medical leave ""were effectively required, once they returned"" after the birth of a child, ""to remain with the office for three times as many weeks as they had been gone."" Those who did not were required to pay back their salary from the days spent out of the office.

Cory Booker, who's been touted as a Democratic rising star since his first bid for mayor of Newark in 2002, is now the field's big, lovable softie. At a time when many Democrats' attitudes are Conan-esque -- they want to crush President Trump, to see his supporters driven before them, and to hear the lamentations of their women -- Booker is talking about ""universal love"" and saying things like, ""You definitely don't get [to a better America] by fighting each other, beating people down."" We'll see whether Democrats find that approach inspiring or hopelessly na√Øve.

As the modern Democratic party is obsessed with identity politics, its 2020 field is likely to have the precise diversity of a Benetton ad. Harris's heritage is Jamaican and Indian, Castro's parents are of Mexican descent, Gabbard's father is of Samoan heritage, Buttigieg is gay, Warren is Native Americ -- okay, we'll end with Buttigieg.

Probably the most intriguing figure still on the sidelines as of this writing is O'Rourke. He spent much of 2018 covered by the national media as a sort of Lone Star Jesus, a ""Vanilla Obama"" who could slay the dragon of Ted Cruz and lead the Democrats to wins in Texas and much of the rest of Red America. He fell short but turned in the best performance by a Democrat running statewide in a generation, leaving many national Democrats virtually begging him to run for president. But after the election, he went on an odd, Kerouac-esque journey through the American West and published an easily parodied diary online. Since then O'Rourke has hemmed and hawed about the decision on Oprah's couch and chosen not to announce at a giant counter-rally when President Trump spoke in El Paso.

Not all of the advantages O'Rourke enjoyed in 2018 are guaranteed in a 2020 bid. National Democrats donated that $80 million to him out of a loathing for Cruz as much as for a love for him. National publications that ran florid prose admiring his sweat probably won't be as uniquely transfixed this time around, and his Democratic-primary rivals will punch back hard. (Perhaps unfairly, given that O'Rourke was running in Texas, they will ask: If he couldn't win against Cruz in a good Democratic year, with more money than any other Senate candidate ever and glowing national media coverage, when exactly can O'Rourke win?) Throw in the 2003 video of him playing guitar onstage in a onesie and a sheep mask, the much more recent videos of him skateboarding in the Whataburger parking lot, the meager record of legislative accomplishments, the oddly under-prosecuted serious DUI at age 26 -- it wouldn't take that much effort to paint the baby-faced O'Rourke as an overgrown teenager. Republicans can accurately joke that he's the kind of slacker ne'er-do-well that Kamala Harris would have put away for a long time in her days as a district attorney.

A handful of the figures still on the sidelines have been around politics long enough that their reputations are carved in granite. No one's going to believe a narrative that Joe Biden is now a careful speaker. But an established reputation may prove to be an advantage when there's so little time and bandwidth to define your persona.

Why do presidential candidates now come in litters? The cost-benefit analysis has changed over the past few cycles. Running unsuccessfully now offers too much upside, not enough downside. The first and most traditional argument against longshot bids -- ""You'll never win!"" -- is now refuted by Trump's unlikely victory. (These candidates forget that Trump entered the primary with 99.2 percent name recognition, according to a survey commissioned by GOP consultant Liz Mair.)

A lot of today's lesser presidential campaigns amount to book tours on a larger scale, complete with a (usually sappy and ghostwritten) autobiography and campaign manifesto. The candidate changes from just another member of Congress to a frequent television guest; he's invited to endless interviews, forums, roundtables, and debates; he writes guest op-eds. News organizations are ravenous for clicks and content, and someone, somewhere, will always want to interview the candidate. It's a sweet deal if you can bear cold weather in Iowa and New Hampshire: Your name is on posters, complete strangers want your autograph and a photo with you, you're always speaking before audiences that agree with you, every joke and jab at the opposition party generates laughter and applause. For about a year, you're constantly told that you matter, and all of this is so much more fun than actual governing. There are plenty of political figures for whom ""finished sixth in the Iowa caucuses"" will rank as a top achievement.

The all-too-easy metaphor for this year's Democratic party is the clown car from which contortionists seem to emerge endlessly, hoping to thrill the people watching. Much like the contortionist-clowns, the Democratic candidates are unique but nearly indistinguishable -- they all loathe Trump; at least rhetorically support ""the Green New Deal,"" some variation of ""Medicare-for-all,"" and free college education; and denounce proposals for physical border barriers as architectural xenophobia. But maybe the more modern comparison is Netflix -- there's no shortage of options, but after a while they all start to look

the same.",506,nationalreview.com,The 2020 Democratic Field Is a Clown-Car Show | National Review
"* Call us old-fashioned, but we don't believe in standing by and saying nothing when women get beaten by men, even in track and field.

* While the House voted to disapprove of President Trump's declaration of a border emergency, all but 13 Republicans stuck with the president. In part that's because they're loyal to Trump, in part because many of their voters are, and in part because they agree -- as do we -- that the government should spend money to augment physical barriers at the border. But the use of emergency declarations to get around partisan disagreements is a genuine novelty, and one at odds with the constitutional design. Senate Republicans who vote to disapprove will anger the White House, but they will have the Constitution (and the polls) on their side.

* Michael Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee (welcome to the new Democratic House, everyone) to audition to be the new John Dean. Most of his testimony was expected: We have been getting leaks about what Cohen knows for months. Two items stood out. Cohen denied going to Prague, a claim of the Steele dossier that contributed to the launch of the Russian-collusion investigation. And Cohen said he was continuing to cooperate with the Southern District of New York -- federal prosecutors looking, beyond the Mueller probe, into other areas of possible Trump wrongdoing. If the president has any vulnerability, it could be here. There were also atmospherics. Woodrow Wilson wanted Congress to be like Parliament serving a prime-ministerial president, not a coordinate branch; most House Republicans obliged, tearing at Cohen like a pack of spaniels. And: Trump and Cohen are now blood enemies, but once they were hand and sock puppet. What does that history say?

* The 2020 Democratic primary may be a marathon, but it has begun with a sprint to the left as the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris work to out-woke one another -- alighting, for the moment, on reparations for slavery. The candidates who are for reparations have not yet come to any consensus on what they would entail: Cash payments to some or all black families? A general broadening of welfare intervention on the theory that this would disproportionately benefit black families? The divide is ideological: Senator Bernie Sanders is among those leaning toward a focus on ""inequality,"" whereas the social-justice Left demands a more explicit focus on race. Reparations are a bad idea for many reasons: There isn't some undifferentiated fund of Confederate or plantation-derived capital out there, and much of what afflicts black America is not likely to be cured by a transfer payment. But this is not, at the moment, a question about policy; it is about positioning, a cynical attempt to get a leg up in what we might call the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary, i.e., the race to secure support from influential social-justice figures on the left. While the primary candidates are working through reparations, Democrats in the states have settled on abortion radicalism, extending now into infanticide, as their litmus test. Both positions are deeply unpopular. The walk back will be long and arduous.

* The House Democratic caucus was recently in a flutter about loss of discipline. Democrats backed a bill to expand federal background checks on gun purchases; Republicans pushed an amendment to require that ICE be notified when illegal aliens try to purchase; freshmen Democrats from swing districts voted with the GOP. Speaker Nancy Pelosi read the moderates a lecture: ""We are either a team or we're not, and we have to make that decision."" Socialist poster-girl Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did her one better, threatening, according to her spokesman, that when ""activists ask her"" how such an amendment got attached to such a bill, ""they're going to want a list of names and she's going to give it to them."" Threats are cheap. The test will be: Can Ocasio-Cortez turn her considerable ability to raise money for herself into a machine that can support primary challengers, and incumbent soulmates, in other districts? That, after all, is the source of Nancy Pelosi's power. Money talks louder than talk.

* Joe Biden made the mistake of referring to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy"" in the course of criticizing Trump in a speech in Nebraska. The compliment was not allowed to stand for long. ""You've just called America's most anti-LGBT elected leader 'a decent guy,'"" tweeted actress and left-wing activist Cynthia Nixon. ""Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community."" ""You're right, Cynthia,"" Biden tweeted back. ""There is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights."" Elizabeth Warren, for her part, went on record with her view that Mike Pence is a bad person. Fair warning for Democratic presidential contenders: It's now a gaffe to concede the basic decency of your political opponents.

* Two cheers for Senator Dianne Feinstein -- the doddering California Democrat whose combination of sanctimoniousness, cluelessness, and great wealth makes her an almost perfect mascot for the contemporary Democratic party, and who has brought momentary focus onto a pet issue of ours: the instrumentalization of children as political props. Senator Feinstein was ambushed by a group of obnoxious brats organized by something calling itself the ""Sunrise Movement,"" the children demanding that she bend the knee to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the so-called Green New Deal. Senator Feinstein, who may not in fact be able to bend at the knee, was having nothing of it and scoffed at the little tykes and their self-important antics: ""I've been doing this for 30 years,"" she told them, which is true. ""I know what I'm doing,"" she added, which is less true. ""You come in here and you say, 'It has to be my way or the highway.' I don't respond to that."" The only way it could have been better is if she'd come out for spanking.

* President Trump ordered that senior adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, be given a top-secret security clearance, over the objections of top administration officials. The FBI vets candidates, and security officials determine whether to grant a clearance. The president, however, is the ultimate authority and has the power to permit access to classified information. Kushner has done a competent job on such weighty responsibilities as Middle East peace negotiations and criminal-justice reform, but he plainly would have been denied a clearance were he not the president's relative. In his vetting process, it emerged that he had potentially problematic foreign associations and heavy business debt; worse, he failed to disclose meetings with Kremlin operatives -- one during the campaign, with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower (implicated in the Trump-Russia investigation), and another with the Russian ambassador and the head of a Kremlin-tied bank. The administration will take a modest political hit over this, and deserves to.

* Senate Democrats have defeated the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide standard medical care to infants born alive in the course of attempted abortions. Forty-four senators voted no -- every Democrat aside from Bob Casey Jr. (Pa.), Doug Jones (Ala.), and Joe Manchin (W. Va.) -- preventing it from reaching the necessary 60-vote threshold. Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), the bill's sponsor, brought the legislation to the floor in response to Virginia governor Ralph Northam's implied endorsement of letting some infants die. Democrats claimed the legislation is anti-abortion and redundant given existing law, but in fact it places no limits on abortion and no comparable federal law exists. Senate Democrats revealed that their dedication to abortion rights is so strong that they are willing to tacitly endorse infanticide.

* The Trump administration has finalized a new rule that will result in the largest drop in federal funding for Planned Parenthood since the group first began receiving government subsidies nearly five decades ago. The rule forbids the use of Title X family-planning funds ""to perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning."" Planned Parenthood and its defenders claim that the policy will remove necessary health care from millions of American women. In reality, family-planning funds won't be reduced at all, merely redirected from groups that commit abortions. The statute governing the Title X program has always declared that ""none of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning,"" but that language has been effectively ignored for much of the program's history. This welcome change ensures that it no longer will be.

* At present, all commercial firearm sales involve an instant background check to establish whether the purchaser is prohibited from owning a gun. If the purchaser passes the check, the sale proceeds. If he fails, the sale is halted. If the check comes back incomplete, the government has three days to complete it or the sale goes ahead. This system is not without its problems, but its existence can be justified on the grounds that almost all commercial sales involve interstate commerce at some point, and that, thanks to the maximum three-day window, it is a highly limited imposition on a core right. The Democrats have passed two bills through the House that are far less justifiable. The purpose of their first bill is to extend federal oversight to firearms transactions performed solely within a state, even when the transfer involves no commercial activity. This violates the enumerated-powers doctrine in service of limiting an enumerated right. The purpose of the second bill is to extend the time during which government incompetence can deny a person access to firearms, which, were the first bill to be enacted, could be obtained by no other means. A series of studies has shown that extending background checks to private sales has no effect at all on crime. These bills will languish in the Senate, as they should.

* Everyone was wrong about the individual mandate, from the Democrats who crafted Obamacare to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which credited the mandate with keeping 14 million Americans insured. Now the mandate is gone, and the consequences are expected to be minimal: A new report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services puts the coverage ""loss"" at just 2.5 million. The original fear was that healthy people would leave the individual market without a mandate because they could sign up later if they got sick. This would raise premiums for everyone else, leading even more healthy people to leave and beginning a ""death spiral."" Now it turns out that most Obamacare enrollees have little reason to abandon the exchanges -- they are heavily subsidized, and the subsidies rise whenever premiums do. The CBO's mistake hurt Republicans in their quest to replace Obamacare, as the agency claimed that killing the mandate would increase the number of uninsured dramatically; it also helped Republicans' tax-reform efforts, because the CBO predicted large savings from repealing the mandate (i.e., enrollees would leave and give up their subsidies). Two wrongs, however, don't put the agency anywhere close to being right.

* Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat and presidential candidate, was among those who greeted the news that the average tax refund this year was smaller than it was last year by lambasting the Republican tax cut as a fraud on the middle class. As we noted in a previous issue, this criticism was absurd. If refunds shrank, it was because tax withholding got more accurate rather than because tax levels rose. Evaluations from across the political spectrum agree that more than 90 percent of tax filers received a net cut. Besides, the complaint was made early in tax season. Data from later on now suggest that the average refund is slightly higher than last year's. The news came out the same day that the Democrats running the House Ways and Means Committee repeated the attack. Refunds aren't vanishing, but this argument against the tax cut is.

* Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell, on Capitol Hill, was asked his thoughts about ""modern monetary theory,"" a recent fad on the left. He replied with some exasperation about how hard it is to pin down its adherents, who respond to every criticism by saying that their theory has been misunderstood. The theory starts with an accurate claim -- that governments can borrow more if their debts are in a currency they themselves issue -- and takes it to imply that governments should rely heavily on debt backstopped by money creation. If inflation rises too high, the MMTers urge, higher taxes should be used to control it. One flaw in this theory is that it depends on politicians' responding to voters angry about inflation by raising their taxes. A second is that politicians have occasionally tried this gambit (check out the latter days of Lyndon Johnson's presidency) and failed. Powell's criticism of MMT slipperiness has also been expressed in recent days by Paul Krugman. Which makes it close to unanimous.

* We recently praised a proposal in the Oregon state legislature to relax zoning regulations, but now the state is headed in a worse, albeit more familiar, direction. Governor Kate Brown signed into law a statewide rent-control bill that caps annual rent increases at 7 percent (plus inflation) and limits landlords' ability to evict their tenants. Both basic theory and decades of practice tell us that rent control doesn't work, but instead discourages the construction of affordable housing and encourages developers to build commercial and luxury properties. This time will be no different, and the eviction restrictions won't help. Even if the bill's cap on rent is comparatively modest, like all regulations it will likely prove to be the edge of a wedge. Housing is decreasingly affordable, in Oregon as in many states. Rent control is not a solution.

* The ""Me Too"" movement has lost one of its leaders. Time's Up CEO Lisa Borders resigned after her son was accused of sexual assault. That fact alone would be newsworthy, but what makes this story particularly poignant is that she resigned in part to ""proactively defend"" her son. Commenting on her resignation, the Time's Up board noted that it ""unequivocally supports"" survivors. As Borders has now learned, it's easy to Believe Women until someone you love faces an accusation. Then, the due process you once scorned becomes a lifeline: the only thing standing between your son and the punitive action that could well ruin his life.

* Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution after being caught in a police sting of Orchids of Asia, a strip-mall spa in Jupiter, Fla. The massage-parlor racket lures Asian women to the United States with promises of work, entangles them in debts to lawyers and other ""helpers,"" often sequesters their passports, and then sends them forth to service clients. The slice of their earnings they command is tiny; to make any real money they must give sexual favors for tips; shame prevents them from coming forward. A dirty, soul-destroying business.

* Early in February, Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) explained on Twitter that politicians support Israel because ""it's all about the Benjamins baby."" A storm of complaint forced her to backtrack. But before the month ended she was at it again, telling a crowd at a left-wing D.C. bookstore that pro-Israel Americans think ""it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country."" This brought a blast from Representative Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) who called her remarks ""outrageous and deeply hurtful."" Such attacks, he added, ""have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee."" Omar sits on it, Engel chairs it. What will the Democratic leadership do? Try to muffle the controversy as long as possible, by passing a resolution condemning such prejudice, without naming Omar and without reassigning her. The lady from Minnesota seems determined to make that as difficult as possible, however. See Proverbs 26:11.

* A sincere apology is not very common in public life, and maybe not all that common in private life either. Madeleine Albright, a secretary of state under President Clinton, gave one. She was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, and one of the subjects was Russia. In the 2012 general election, President Obama mocked the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, for his concerns about Russia. Albright chimed in with her own criticism. But, in front of the intelligence committee, she said, ""I personally owe an apology to now-Senator Romney."" Why? ""I think that we underestimated what was going on in Russia. I was on the CIA external advisory board. There was no question that less money was being put into Russian language and what was going on in Russia."" Some people have a tendency to forget, said Albright, that a KGB man runs the Kremlin. And he ""has played a weak hand very well."" He has put Russia ""back on the scene."" Albright's is a reset we can support.

* The standoff in Venezuela continues, with military and security forces largely remaining loyal to the strongman, Nicol√°s Maduro. Juan Guaid√≥ and the opposition continue to try to tip them. The government succeeded in blocking humanitarian aid to the starving country. Authorities fired buckshot and tear gas at people trying to deliver the aid. That, among other things, revealed the dark heart of this chavista regime. The United States placed sanctions on Venezuelan officials responsible for such actions. That hit them in their pocketbooks, where it hurts. The U.S. also revoked the visas of dozens of others. The wreckers of Venezuelan democracy ""are not welcome in the United States,"" said Elliott Abrams, the State Department envoy to Venezuela. ""Neither are their family members who enjoy a privileged lifestyle at the expense of the liberty and prosperity of millions of Venezuelans."" People speak of ""the right side of history."" Leaving history out of it, the United States is definitely on the right side.

* The world has a nervous twitch whenever India and Pakistan reveal their mutual hostility and there is the prospect of a nuclear exchange. Last month, a suicide bomber from Jaish e-Muhammad, one of the most aggressive Islamist groups, killed 42 Indian paramilitary policemen in Pulwama, a town in the part of Kashmir under Indian rule. Reprisal soon followed. The Indian air force attacked the Jaish e-Muhammad encampment, claiming to have killed 300. In a dogfight the next day, Pakistan shot down two Indian MiGs, captured one of the pilots, put him on television, and returned him home. Face saved all around, the world again stopped twitching.

* For two years the Israeli authorities have been examining charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has abused his office. It's a witch hunt, Netanyahu maintains; his opponents have tried and failed to vote him out, so they resort to this alternative. Calling for a general election on April 9, he'd given them one more chance to vote him out. In the runup, however, Avichai Mandelblit, the attorney general, has announced that Netanyahu faces criminal charges of corruption, bribery, and breach of trust, for which he is to be indicted. It is alleged that Netanyahu promoted regulatory changes that benefited a telecom company, in return for which the company's news site published items favorable to him; and also that he accepted champagne and cigars to the value of $300,000. The timing of the charges is at best unfortunate, at worst its own abuse. They have wiped out the record of Netanyahu's ten-year tenure, and his ratings in the polls have fallen. Whether or not he is found guilty, this is a stricken moment for Israel.

* Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is in trouble, and that trouble follows a familiar pattern: Young progressive rides into office on a white steed with promises of unprecedented openness and accountability, but quickly gets mired in a predictable scandal involving politically connected business interests, abuse of power, and domestic realpolitik. In Trudeau's case, the allegation is that he attempted to bully his justice minister at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into rigging an investigation in favor of Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin, an engineering and construction firm that is accused of bribing Moammar Qaddafi's Libya in pursuit of fat infrastructure contracts and then defrauding the same government of hundreds of millions of dollars. A criminal conviction in the matter might have cost tens of thousands of jobs in Canada, and Trudeau and his gang handed down a number of what Wilson-Raybould described as ""veiled threats"" intended to influence the investigation on SNC's behalf. Irrespective of what becomes of the Trudeau government, there is a lesson: What is in theory progressivism in practice is corporatism, an alliance of political and business interests that incentivizes corruption of the kind Trudeau stands accused of.

* The headline in the (London) Telegraph said a lot: ""Saudi crown prince defends China's right to put Uighur Muslims in concentration camps."" Between a million and 2 million of these people have been rounded up. They are subject to torture and murder. The Chinese Communist Party is doing its utmost to wipe out the Uighur language and culture. The Party has turned Xinjiang Province, or East Turkestan, into the most oppressive surveillance region in the world. Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman traveled to Beijing to secure trade deals. Riyadh and Beijing enjoy friendly relations. The Chinese have backed the Saudis 100 percent in their murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. According to Chinese state media, MBS said this about his fellow Muslims in China: ""We respect and support China's rights to take counter-terrorism and de-extremism measures to safeguard national security."" Xi Jinping could not have said it better. Fred Hiatt, the editorial-page editor of the Washington Post, summed up the crown prince's attitude this way: ""You can have your concentration camps. I can have my murder.""

* Confucius Institutes have always been problematic, when not downright sinister. They are expressions of the Chinese Communist Party's ""soft power."" The institutes are language-and-culture centers on university campuses throughout the world, and there are almost 100 in the United States. Recent days have seen two reports on Confucius Institutes: one from a Senate subcommittee, one from the Government Accountability Office. Both reports voice well-grounded concerns about the institutes -- in particular, the CCP influence that comes with them. In 2014, the American Association of University Professors issued a report of its own. AAUP said that universities should either close their Confucius Institutes or renegotiate their agreements with Beijing so as to ensure academic freedom. That makes good sense. Plus, a university can establish its own Chinese program, however humble. Given that the Chinese government is a one-party dictatorship with a gulag and ethnic prison camps, why should an American university be in partnership with it in the first place?

* The French government has announced a complete ban on cell phones in elementary and intermediate state-run schools, effective next year. The ban will apply not just in classrooms but everywhere; students will not even be able to check their phones between classes or during recess. A parents' group opposes the ban, while educators seem split: Half fear being turned into gendarmes to enforce the policy while the rest welcome anything that might force the students to focus on their work. Other arguments, pro and con, can be made, mostly depending on circumstance; and that's why, instead of issuing edicts from Paris, the best course would be to let local teachers, parents, and residents decide each school's policy on their own. But the land that invented laissez-faire rarely practices it.

* Members of the United Methodist Church, America's third-largest Christian denomination, voted in a special conference to reaffirm orthodox Christian teaching against homosexuality. That teaching entails both the decision not to certify ""self-avowed practicing homosexuals"" for ministry and the understanding that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. The vote for the ""Traditional Plan"" on human sexuality was close -- 53 to 47 percent -- and angered many within the Methodist fold and in the wider world. Those who adhere to orthodox Christian sexual morality have won a battle in a culture war that they're losing, at least here in the West. Their rejection of homosexuality stems from bedrock beliefs about the purpose of sex. To answer the charge of bigotry, they need to situate their beliefs in the context of that larger vision, which is honorable, and to explain it with equal measures of clarity and charity.

* Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, transgender students in Connecticut, came first and second in the 55-meter girls' indoor state track championship this year. Selina Soule, a competitor who was narrowly defeated, pointed out on Fox News that Miller and Yearwood have obvious physiological advantages as biological males. She's right. Taller height, greater weight, broader shoulders, stronger grip, bigger lung capacity, more upper-body strength, higher muscle-to-fat ratio, and longer resistance to dehydration are just some of the reasons for the performance gap between men and women in sports. Yet some believe that pointing this out amounts to ""transphobia."" Martina Navratilova, nine-time Wimbledon singles champion, found out as much after she wrote in the Sunday Times of London that allowing biological males to compete in women's sports based on nothing but their self-reported gender identity was ""insane."" For this she was promptly dropped from the board of a U.S. LGBT sports organization. Thus does women's sports disclaim its own history and subvert its own purpose.

* ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?"" Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson, himself a black man, asked upon announcing the arrest of Jussie Smollett. Why Smollett would use the symbolism of a noose is obvious: Such shocking, hateful, incendiary details are certain to generate vast quantities of publicity. Smollett, an actor who Johnson said wished to use such exposure to raise his weekly salary for the show Empire (reported by the Associated Press to be more than $100,000), was charged on February 21 with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false report after he allegedly paid $3,500 to two brothers to fake a hate-crime attack. The details of that assault looked to neutral observers like low-grade television writing, and the methodical accounts of Chicago reporters who covered the story up close made it clear from the start that there was likely more to things than met the eye. Nevertheless, national activist groups and celebrities rushed to blame the fake attack on the supposedly hateful atmosphere created by President Trump and/or Vice President Pence. If any of these grievance hucksters have apologized for further dividing America, we must have missed it.

* The big winner at the 91st annual Academy Awards ceremony was Green Book, a soft-hitting, ground-non-breaking buddy comedy about an uneducated white driver overcoming his racial bias in the process of witnessing the racist cloud that trails a gifted black pianist he chauffeurs around the Jim Crow Deep South. Observers who were rooting for an angrier race movie, such as Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman, or a film whose cast is almost entirely black, such as Black Panther, denounced the choice -- Green Book ""reeks of bad faith and cluelessly embodies the white-supremacist attitudes it's ostensibly decrying,"" wrote Justin Chang in the Los Angeles Times. Lee himself, when the evening's last winner was announced, staged an impromptu one-man protest, turning his back on the speech of winning producer Peter Farrelly. Green Book is a trite mediocrity that was anointed solely because the Academy wants to show it stands against racism, but the fracas about its victory demonstrated that, once identity politics rather than quality becomes the chief criterion by which life's goodies come to be distributed, the result is not a widely shared feeling of social satisfaction but bitterness and resentment.

* You know how your spouse is always nagging you to clean the garbage out of the car? Candy wrappers, pencil stubs, packets of tissues with only one left -- some of history's most passionate love affairs have foundered over this issue. But there's hope. The next time your beloved renews this complaint, you can remind him or her of the case of Jeremy Taylor, an Oregon man who drove into the wilderness and found himself stranded in deep snow. With his faithful dog, Ally, he stayed in his car for five days, periodically running the engine for warmth (pro tip: always dig out the tailpipe first). Taylor says the only food he had during his ordeal was three packets of Taco Bell ""fire"" sauce -- which must have heated him up at least a little and was probably not something the dog was tempted to steal. So don't go clearing everything out of that glove compartment just yet: The life you save may be your own.

* ""We want to bring a title back to D.C.,"" Bryce Harper, sounding caffeinated, told reporters after the announcement that he was leaving D.C. -- for Philadelphia, which, after all, some Washingtonians consider a D.C. suburb. The star slugger for the Washington Nationals had just signed a record contract with their rival the Phillies, who are now committed to paying Harper $330 million over the next 13 seasons. Big-sum, long-term contracts usually don't work out for the clubs that spring for them. (Ask the New York Mets, who every year until the end of time or 2035, whichever comes first, have to send a check for $1.19 million to Bobby Bonilla, retired from major-league ball since 2001. Better yet, don't ask.) Harper, the first-round draft pick in 2010 and the most touted phenom since Sidd Finch, had a great year for the Nationals . . . in 2015. He strikes out a lot, though he walks a lot. He hits a home run every four or five games. A designated hitter at heart, he's an outfielder in the National League because it's the National League. His contract makes no apparent sense, but good for him. Good luck to the Phils.

* After more than 20 years at NR, our colleague Jonah Goldberg is leaving to start a new media venture. Jonah is a unique talent who has enlivened our pages and pixels with his incredible wit, profound understanding of conservative ideas and history, and wide-ranging interests, from Star Wars to dogs (and more dogs). We're delighted he'll remain a National Review Institute fellow. He's a star in the conservative firmament, and we -- like so many others -- will continue to be devoted fans.

* Seweryn Bialer lived a 20th-century life. He was born in Berlin in 1926. He grew up in Lodz, Poland, in a prominent Jewish family. He survived Auschwitz. He threw himself into Communism, becoming an official in Poland. But in 1956, he defected, in West Berlin. He wrote an article headed ""I Chose Truth."" In the United States, he earned a Ph.D. in political science at Columbia, and he taught at that university for decades after. He was an expert on the Soviet Union and its sad satellites. From men such as Professor Bialer, we learned a lot, because they had, the hard way. He has died at 92. R.I.P.

* Andr√© Previn was one of the most talented people of our time, or any. He could do a range of things with unseemly ease. He was a composer, of classical music and popular music. He was a pianist: one of the best of jazz pianists, and a distinguished classical pianist, too. He was one of the leading symphonic conductors in the world. And, to add insult to injury, he wrote prose very well, too. He was born in 1929 in Berlin. His family got out just in time: 1938. They went to Hollywood, where a relative, Charles Previn, was a top musician. Andr√© was a boy wonder. His whole life long, he would be a celebrity, appearing on television and marrying movie stars. He seemed to enjoy life, and why not? He also spread enjoyment to others, through his music of various types. He has died at 89, with his fellow musicians expressing awe at his talent(s). R.I.P.

Donald Trump walked away from talks with North Korea, which was the best possible outcome given that he never should have walked into the talks to begin with.

In the unlikely event that North Korea wanted to give up its nuclear program, it could have demonstrated its commitment over time in low-level talks building toward an agreement. Instead, President Trump took the high-wire route of two direct meetings with Kim Jong-un, giving the North Korean dictator, if nothing else, an incalculable propaganda coup by enhancing his international standing.

Worse, Trump couldn't help but make boosterish comments about the Supreme Leader, who enslaves and immiserates his people. In Hanoi, he even professed to take seriously Kim Jong-un's denial that he had anything to do with Otto Warmbier's murder, as if rogue security services are kidnapping and torturing Americans on their own initiative in the most tightly controlled society on Earth.

All signs were that the North Koreans were heading to a diplomatic win, getting sanctions relief -- as well as a U.S. liaison office in Pyongyang and a formal end to the Korean War -- in exchange for steps to dismantle the Yongbyon enrichment facility. This is a version of the sucker's deal that the U.S. has fallen for time and again with the North. Pyongyang's play is to pocket any economic relief and diplomatic recognition and then cheat on its commitments. Indeed, President Trump revealed that we are aware of a second, heretofore unknown enrichment facility.

For whatever reason, though, the North Koreans pushed Trump on sanctions relief farther than he was willing to go, and the president left the table.

This avoids, for the time being, making the mistake Trump's personal diplomacy was headed toward (although we are still foolishly scaling back joint military exercises with the South). Now the president should return to the robust program of economic, military, and diplomatic pressure that his administration was pursuing prior to this detour.

It is a temptation for all leaders, especially Trump, who makes everything personal, to overestimate how much a relationship and direct talks can overcome ineluctable strategic and ideological considerations. It's time to realize that Kim Jong-un is not a promising young man. He's not going to give up a nuclear program that is central to his regime's existence. And he'll realistically sign on only to a deal that he believes extends the life of his dictatorship.

We hope the failure in Hanoi is the beginning of wisdom.",507,nationalreview.com,The Week | National Review
"President Trump's demand-side economic policy so far has been successful, and his demand-side views are an improvement on the views of Republicans in the recent past. His willingness to increase budget deficits, often in the face of criticism from deficit hawks across the political spectrum, has put people back to work and has been an unalloyed good for the country. In contrast, the worries of his budget's critics have not materialized, and there is no sign that they will in the future.

It may be surprising that Trump has been successful in this area; he has made plenty of erratic statements on economics generally and demand-side economics specifically. For example, he has a habit of criticizing the Federal Reserve chairman, who is supposed to be independent of politics, and he has made plenty of contradictory or false statements about the size of his tax cut. Critics of his demand-side approach are sober-minded and serious. Despite that, Trump's actual policies have been reasonable, successful, and a move in the right direction.

Demand-side policy is about money. A government can issue its own currency, and it can make choices about when to release money into the economy or when to hold it back. Any state issuing a currency has to make some choices in this area. Both releasing money into the economy (a ""loose"" policy), which can be done through deficit spending and holding interest rates low, and pulling it back (a ""tight"" policy), which can be done by closing deficits and raising interest rates, have their strategic uses.

Economists over a century of study have found that economies tend to fail in two kinds of ways. The first is when there is too little money in the economy. In this situation, people sometimes end up without work -- not because they cannot produce, and not because their talents are not desired, but because their would-be customers don't have enough money to pay them. This is tremendously painful: Generations can permanently lose earning potential, and suicide rates even can rise in times of higher unemployment. Such a problem can be remedied by loose policy, releasing more money into the economy in order to employ more of those able would-be workers.

The second mode of failure is when there is too much money in the economy. In this situation, there are few able but unemployed workers left but lots of extra money ""looking"" for things to buy. In this case, producers raise prices, often rapidly, which frustrates consumers and financial markets alike. Unchecked, this trend can accelerate into hyperinflation and the eventual collapse of the currency. But it can be remedied by tight policy, which brings currency back home to its issuer and stops the overflow.

Demand-side policymaking is the task of charting a course between these two different kinds of failure. The Trump administration has pursued a loose policy so far, the kind you would take if you were more worried about jobs than about inflation. It cut taxes by $1.5 trillion, without cutting spending overall. Along the tight-loose continuum, this is not far from the policies of President Obama. Obama's priorities tilted more toward spending increases than tax cuts, but both presidents pursued both means of loosening fiscal policy.

Their choices were correct given the circumstances. Both presidents inherited economies in which far too many able workers were out of work. In 2007, more than 80 percent of working-age adults were employed. By the depths of the recession, their share had fallen to about 75 percent. The fiscal policies of the Obama and Trump administrations released more money into the economy, jointly bringing the number back to nearly 80 percent. This was the right thing to do.

In fact, one could argue that there is still more room to go. Is it not at least worth trying to achieve a prime-age employment level of 82 percent, which the U.S. economy reached between 1999 and 2000?

Both presidents endured criticism for their loose policy. Obama was criticized by many on the right and center, though liberals supported his stimulus efforts. By the time Trump took office, many liberals had changed positions to join the conservative deficit hawks. The proportion of prime-age adults who were employed stood at 78 percent, and the hawks thought that Obama had accomplished most or all of the recovery that would be possible and that deficit reduction would now be appropriate.

But Trump discarded the apparent Republican orthodoxy favoring tight policy, disregarded these critics, and increased budget deficits, ultimately bringing some wavering hawks on board. The employment rate has continued to climb.

The most traditional sign that a loose policy has backfired is rising inflation. It would suggest that, rather than putting people back to work, the money released into the economy had simply bid up the prices of existing goods. However, inflation has not risen past the Federal Reserve's traditional 2 percent target.

Critics of loose policy may respond that its ills can be delayed but that, eventually, they will come due. While we cannot know the future, we can look at what markets are expecting. One sign of Trump's loose policy backfiring would be a rapid run-up in interest rates over the next few years. This would show that the Federal Reserve needs to increase interest rates substantially to curb inflation, or even that bondholders doubt the nation's ability to repay its debts.

If markets expected this, longer-term U.S. bonds such as the ten-year Treasury note would see higher interest rates. However, there is no sign of such a development in bond prices. At this time, the ten-year yield sits only barely above that of the two-year, suggesting that markets expect rate hikes to slow down in the medium term, not speed up. Markets do expect turmoil, and they do seem to dislike many of Trump's policies, but they are not fearing an inflationary spiral.

It is hard to tell exactly why Trump is more dovish than previous GOP policymakers. Perhaps it is because of his background in real estate, which is notoriously sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Perhaps it is just a case of a stopped clock's being right twice a day. Or perhaps populists such as Trump see opportunities that many professional economists and commentators miss. For all their faults, populists are truffle pigs when it comes to sniffing out cases in which cries of ""You can't do that!"" are backed by little to no adverse consequences.",508,nationalreview.com,In Praise of Donald Trump's Loose Fiscal Policy | National Review
"Taylor Swift broke her silence on her political beliefs last year during the midterms elections and now the pop singer is explaining why she decided to speak up.

The Grammy-winner said in a new interview that she realized she has a greater ""responsibility"" because of her enormous fan base and social media following.

In an essay she wrote for Elle magazine, Swift admitted she's ""finding"" her voice ""in terms of politics.""

""I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change,"" she added.

Swift called herself ""informed enough to speak about [politics] now"" and wants to have an open relationship with her 114 plus million Instagram followers.

TAYLOR SWIFT REFLECTS ON TURNING 30, LESSONS SHE'S LEARNED AND WRITING MUSIC

""Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I'm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year,"" she wrote.

During the 2008 midterms, she posted a long message about why she was supporting former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D-TN) against then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) -- though her support didn't lead to a victory.

""In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG,"" she said. ""I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love.""

TAYLOR SWIFT SEEMS TO ADDRESS KIM KARDASHIAN FEUD: I FELT 'LOWER THAN I'VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE'

In her essay, Swift also reflected on her highly publicized sexual assault trial and why people should always believe individuals who come forward.

""It's my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying 'This happened to me.' It's something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don't,"" she said.",509,Fox News,Taylor Swift says it's her 'responsibility' to use her 'influence against' 'disgusting' political rhetoric
"The victory of Green Book over the rest of the Best Picture competition at the Academy Awards was unfortunate for many reasons, not least because it left me feeling like I have no choice but to actually write something about the film. When it came out three months ago it hardly seemed worth the trouble: Reviews were tepid, box-office sales were relatively weak, and pre-release chatter about Oscars gave way swiftly to think pieces explaining all of the ways that Green Book failed the tests of wokeness, all of the ways its old-fashioned liberal message-movie approach to storytelling about race simply didn't cut it anymore.

Even after A Star Is Born lost traction across awards season, even after Green Book pulled off an upset at the Golden Globes, it was still hard to imagine a movie so little loved capturing Best Picture. By Oscar night, oddsmakers had managed to convince themselves that Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Roma -- Netflix pedigree and all -- was destined to take the prize instead.

And if the Best Picture weren't chosen by so-called preferential voting, in which a film that places high enough on many ballots can beat the film that gets the plurality of first-place votes, then perhaps Roma would have won. But the system rewards consensus, it rewards movies that lots of voters like -- and it rewarded Green Book, in the end, adding its name to the list of dud Best Picture winners that nobody is likely to revisit save in trivia.

And it is a dud. The elevator pitch -- What if we did Driving Miss Daisy but reversed the races of the passenger and the driver? -- seems like it belongs in a television show mocking the Hollywood way of trying to win Oscars. Given that premise, the film itself could be worse: Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, respectively the racist Italian-American bouncer and the accomplished black (and gay) pianist he's been hired to drive around the Jim Crow South, do everything they can to elevate a story founded on self-congratulatory clich√©. But in the end the movie is still the kind of preachy, sentimental portrait of racism-overcome-through-unlikely-friendship that Hollywood has been making since the age of Poitier, and with better scripts than this one.

So why did it win? The simple answer is that this was one of the worst years for movies in my lifetime, bad years produce weak nominees, and weak nominees make it more likely that a lousy winner will slip through. Roma was technically the best film out of the nominated eight, but it wasn't particularly lovable -- and its Netflix-backed, released-on-TV mode of cinema understandably leaves a lot of Hollywood unsettled. A Star Is Born was the nominee that most resembled a classic Best Picture winner, but it was half a great movie, predictable and deadly after the 70-minute mark. There was no perfect work of cinema that the Green Book victory egregiously robbed.

Another answer, one that might mildly please conservatives, is that Green Book won because Hollywood isn't yet fully on board with the fully woke critique of the old liberalism and its pieties. The fact that progressive Twitter didn't like the way the movie has a black character and a white character learning from each other (instead of whiteness simply being put on trial) or the way it portrays racism as a moral failing that can be outgrown or educated away (rather than a structural evil that may be ineradicable) mattered less than people on, well, progressive Twitter expected. In this sense, the outcome was a small act of rebellion by Academy voters, in behalf of an older and more racially optimistic form of liberalism, against the more pessimistic narrative that dominates the rising Left.

But that act of rebellion still rewarded a bad movie for its liberal politics, which leads to the third reason for the Green Book victory -- the apparent feeling among Academy voters that in the age of Trump the Oscar simply has to go to a movie that somehow offers a political alternative to the president, that raises the banner of liberalism from the Oscar stage.

The mode in which the anti-Trump message has been delivered has varied each year, and so has the quality of the movie being rewarded: Moonlight was overrated but decent art-house fare, while The Shape of Water was at once more stylish and more ludicrous than the middlebrow Green Book. But each time the politicization of the Best Picture competition has sidelined the kind of skillfully crowd-pleasing, not terribly political movies that might have won in a different era -- Dunkirk or Arrival or A Star Is Born.

And that is, in the end, a very bad thing for the Oscars. The show ultimately exists, as my colleague Kyle Smith wrote immediately after this year's effort, to sell the world on ""stardust,"" and yet, ""the only time all evening that produced a shiver of movie magic"" was the almost-too-sexy Bradley Cooper-Lady Gaga duet. Which tells you something about which movie would have won had the Academy understood the purpose of its show.

For all its many flaws, A Star Is Born was the only nominee trying to be the kind of movie that justifies all the pomp and absurdity of Oscar night. And its defeat, while hardly a tragedy, is probably a worse sign for the future of the film business than the fact that a pious, lousy movie won.",510,nationalreview.com,Green Book's Oscars Victory: Why a Lousy Film Won Best Picture | National Review
"Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has revealed that he would have been willing to work for Hillary Clinton had she won the 2016 presidential election.

""If Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, and she had called me and said, 'I really need a good chief of staff here,' I'd have probably done it,"" Kelly said during a Q&A session Wednesday at Duke University in North Carolina, according to NBC News.

""Politics aside, it's all about governing the country,"" he added.

Kelly, 68, became chief of staff in 2017, moving from the Department of Homeland Security, when Reince Priebus flamed out in the role after just six months.

The retired four-star Marine Corps general -- who had a hard time hiding distaste for some of the President Trump's public actions -- tried to manage his schedule and bring discipline to the freewheeling administration.

Kelly told the audience Wednesday that being chief of staff was ""the least enjoyable job I've ever had,"" adding, ""But it was he most important job I've ever had.""

He dodged questions about Trump reportedly intervening to secure top-secret security clearances for his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Kelly did not deny reports that Trump skirted the usual process to grant security clearances or that he later wrote a memo detailing his concerns about it. He said only that he believes any such conversations with the commander-in-chief would be privileged.

He also said he disagreed with some Trump administration policies, most notably on immigration, and criticized the White House's handling of children at the southern border.

And he pushed back on Trump's oft-stated comments that many immigrants seeking entry into the US along the border with Mexico are criminals.

""They're overwhelmingly not criminals. They're people coming up here for economic purposes. I don't blame them for that,"" he said.

He also didn't defend the president's decision to declare a national emergency to get funding for a border wall.

""We don't need a wall from sea to shining sea,"" he said as he also expressed disagreement with the deployment of troops to the border.

""Generally speaking I would always look for another way to do it,"" Kelly said.

He also said Trump's executive order imposing a travel ban shortly after taking office was a mistake committed by inexperienced aides who didn't seek input from various government agencies.

The White House staff ""got a little bit maybe out in front if their skis,"" he said.

And despite multiple reports that Kelly saw himself as the ""adult in the room,"" he denied taking that view.

""In my view everyone in the room was an adult,"" he said.

"Google's senior director of U.S. public policy, Adam Kovacevich appeared to describe the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as a ""sideshow Circus,"" in a leaked audio recording in which he also argued that Google should remain a sponsor of the conference to ""steer"" the conservative movement ""away from nationalistic and incendiary comments.""

The comments came to light in leaked audio files allegedly of a company-wide meeting at Google, part of which is now exclusively reported by Breitbart News. Another part of the transcript was released last Friday on Tucker Carlson Tonight, while further snippets revealing Google's funding of establishment conservative think-tanks were published by the left-leaning tech magazine Wired in December.

The alleged meeting took place in the wake of Google's sponsorship of CPAC in 2018, which triggered an internal rebellion from left-wing employees of the tech giant. Breitbart News exclusively reported on the revolt at the time, in which radical left-wingers inside Google accused CPAC of ""ethno-nationalism"" and ""hate.""

Google has not denied the authenticity of the leaked material.

In the clips, the transcripts of which posted in full below, Kovacevich portrayed CPAC as a conference with a ""dual identity,"" one being a ""premier gathering"" that features a ""whole swath of conservatives,"" including ""national security conservatives, economic conservatives, libertarians, the Log Cabin Republicans, deficit hawks, small government advocates.""

In the audio clip, the other side of CPAC was described in disparaging terms by Kovacevich as featuring a ""sideshow circus-like element"" which ""CPAC organizers have intentionally cultivated sometimes, inviting outrageous figures that say incendiary and offensive things, I think in order to draw more attention and controversy to the conference.""

""I want to be clear that we don't agree with those things, right?"" continued Kovacevich. ""We abhor and rebuke the offensive things that are said at the conference. Those things obviously don't align with Google's values and our approach.""

""And I think it's challenging for us to reconcile those two identities of CPAC.""

In another audio clip of the same conversation provided to Breitbart News, Kovacevich appeared to describe the importance of reaching out to conservatives in order to counter conservative media, including Breitbart News. Kovacevich warned of ""growing negative attention from the conservative media which is influential among those same Republicans who control government."" He went on to accuse conservative media of ""pushing the storyline that Google is biased against conservatives.""

""And of course we aim to build products for everyone but if that notion becomes accepted among conservative and Republican policymakers, that could be harmful to our mission of building products for everyone.""

The full transcript follows below:

Yeah, it's a great question Greg. I appreciate the question. I think one of the big themes - I think picking up on your question - that I saw in some internal listservs and one of the Dory questions focused on the question of the other speakers, right? What are we saying in terms of sponsoring a conference where you have sort of incendiary speakers, right, and I think it's a very valid question, one we've talked a lot about here. I think, to be candida, one of the challenges we face with CPAC is that the conference itself has a kind of a dual identity. So on the one hand, it's really the premier gathering of sort of big-tent conservatives. Especially in non-presidential years it sort of in some ways takes the place of the annual Republican National Convention. You have a whole swath of conservatives: national security conservatives, economic conservatives, libertarians, the Log Cabin Republicans, deficit hawks, small government advocates who attend the conference. The conference is attended by about 10,000 people. And so one of the other things is that the Republican Party and I think conservatism, in general, is also going through a lot of internal debates about what it should be, right, what should be sort of the position of the party. And I think that's one that we should be involved in because we, I think, want probably -- the majority of Googlers would want to steer conservatives and Republicans more towards a message of liberty and freedom and away from the more sort of nationalistic incendiary comments, nativist comments and things like that. But it has been a very valuable place for us to reach a lot of the people and the big tent of conservatism.

On the other hand, and sort of to get to the point of the dual identity, in recent years with CPAC there has also been this kind of sideshow circus-like element, right, that I think the CPAC organizers have intentionally cultivated sometimes, inviting outrageous figures that say incendiary and offensive things, I think in order to draw more attention and controversy to the conference. I want to be clear that we don't agree with those things, right? We abhor and rebuke the offensive things that are said at the conference. Those things obviously don't align with Google's values and our approach. And I think that it's challenging for us to reconcile those two identities of CPAC. I think one of the things that -- we also face this question in other areas, by the way. So in the realm of sort of politics, there's always going to -- there's often going to be someone at some event we sponsor who will say something we don't agree with. Last year, a group that we support, the New America Foundation, had your guys's, one of your Senators, Elizabeth Warren. She spoke, and she called for the breakup of Google at that [laughter] conference, right? The conference of an organization we support. Obviously we don't support that position.

In another audio clip provided exclusively to Breitbart News, Kovacevich discusses ""growing negative attention"" from conservative media, including Breitbart News.

One of the other things we're dealing with is also growing negative attention from the conservative media which is influential among those same Republicans who control government. We have sites like Breitbart and Daily Caller and Fox News who have been focusing on some of the tensions that we Googlers feel internally around -- many of which became public after the Damore memo. And I think some of those media outlets are actively pushing the storyline that Google is biased against conservatives. And of course we aim to build products for everyone but if that notion becomes accepted among conservative and Republican policymakers, that could be harmful to our mission of building products for everyone. So one of the things we say out on our team is, in order to count on an ally in the political realm you have to make an ally. If we want policymakers to help us when we have a bad bill or a regulation pending, we have to build relationships with them ahead of time. I think part of our work in the DC office and across all of our team is building relationships not just with the people in power but also with the people who influence them.

In a followup question, Kovacevich also acknowledged the ""pain"" and ""disappointment"" of Google employees who were up in arms at the tech giant's sponsorship of CPAC in 2018. He went on to openly disparage sites like Breitbart and the Daily Caller as outlets that might be ""perpetually"" at odds with Google, and state ""blatant mistruths.""

Questioner: Okay. Second question is- you mentioned Breitbart and The Daily Caller a couple of times before in the talk. Are we orienting our public image so that we will receive less negative and maybe more positive press from sites like Breitbart and Daily Caller?

Kovacevich: I think it's a complicated question. I mean, I think at a certain point our values are our values, right? Google stands for inclusiveness, we stand for tolerance, we stand for building products for everyone, and if certain outlets don't like that, we are probably going to be at odds with them perpetually, right? On the other hand, sometimes some outlets and others just state blatant kind of mistruths, right, or they'll shade something in sort of the most- you know, that has a legitimate explanation, they'll shade something in sort of the most negative light possible, and that's something that we try to avoid, if we can, consistent with our values. I think- and I want to probably wrap up because we're almost at the hour- look, I appreciate that this is hard and I know that our sponsorship of this has caused pain, disappointment to many of you and we understand that, and I think appreciate those of you who have spoken up about that. I value that Google is the kind of company where people can voice their disappointment and their hopes for how the company can stay true to its ideals going forward in the future. We certainly didn't mean to cause pain or that kind of disappointment in people. And we really do value the feedback and the input.

"Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America, by Noah Rothman (Regnery Gateway, 256 pp., $28.99)

Love keeps no record of wrongs, the apostle Paul writes to the church at Corinth, and indeed it needn't. Noah Rothman has done the job expertly.

Rothman, an associate editor of Commentary and a frequent guest on the cable-news shows, has assembled in this, his first book, the most complete record of the social-justice movement's offenses against reason (and justice) that readers are likely to find. Subscribers to this magazine will recognize much of the rotten fruit that Rothman gathers but will be stunned anew by the sheer weight of the harvest. Conservatives approaching the book with only a vague sense of the problem may well leave it in a state of panic.

Because the fact is that public life in this nation is now almost completely dominated by ""the antisocial dogmas that underlie ideological social justice,"" to borrow Rothman's penetrating language. Social justice ""influences how businesses structure themselves. It is altering how employers and employees relate to one another. It has utterly transformed academia. [And] it is remaking our politics with alarming swiftness.""

In support of these contentions, Rothman assembles a parade of illustrations that are by turns horrifying and darkly comic. Among them are the sagas of James Damore, the Google employee who was fired after composing an internal memo suggesting that the industry's ""gender gap"" might be explained by the differing interests of men and women; Erika and Nicholas Christakis, professors at Yale who were driven from their positions after objecting to the university's politically correct guidelines for students' Halloween costumes; and Maggie Stiefvater, whose young-adult novel All the Crooked Saints was condemned as racist while the manuscript was still in progress. Cited, too, are such absurdities as a Reuters report praising a Brooklyn mother's affirmation of her three-year-old's transgender identity and the New York City Commission on Human Rights' warning that employers can be fined for failing to use their employees' preferred pronouns. Columbia University's decision to reserve certain campus areas for the exclusive use of LGBT and minority students is examined in these pages, as are the University of Missouri's 2015 racial kerfuffles and the false rape allegations against the Duke lacrosse team and the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. I could go on. Rothman does.

The great accomplishment of Unjust is that it succeeds in synthesizing these anecdotes (and many others) into a coherent narrative. Though seemingly disparate, such illustrations in sum reveal the extent to which a movement that might have set its sights on the amelioration of legitimate societal ills has instead been transformed into a vehicle for the Left's worst ideas: ""an affinity for racial hierarchies and race-based preferences, antipathy to due process and the presumption of innocence, [and the] reduction of individuals to nondescript representatives of their taxonomic class."" Whatever it could have been, Rothman asserts, social justice is now ""a creed born of grievances"" -- a crusade ""fueled by anxiety, a preoccupation with oneself, and the need for a constant stream of new enemies.""

In Rothman's telling, the assumptions that guide contemporary social-justice activism are dangerous in part because they cross partisan lines. While a less sophisticated conservative polemic might have trained its fire on the Left alone, Rothman is careful to demonstrate that a similar intellectual cancer has taken root on the alt-right, whose white-nationalist program can best be understood as an attempt to achieve social justice for a shrinking Caucasian majority. Thus, Rothman writes, just as ""the social justice left is generally hostile toward any distribution of social goods that does not disadvantage that majority,"" so ""the alt-right is wholly suspicious of any distribution"" that fails to privilege America's white citizens. The consequence of these resentments is, inevitably, a cycle of mutual loathing in which the participants are increasingly indistinguishable. In one of Unjust's most cogent passages, Rothman peruses a number of Antifa websites and tracts only to find that the bile contained therein bears a striking resemblance to corresponding ravings on the other extreme of the political spectrum. ""Replace the objects of [Antifa's] hatred (homophobes, frat boys, bank tellers, etc.) with the objects of white nationalist hatred (miscegenation, minorities, 'social justice warriors,' etc.), and these ugly sentiments are almost ideologically interchangeable.""

Among the additional drawbacks of the grievance-mongering practiced at both political poles is its tendency to inculcate a view of the world (if they gain, we lose) that is both morally and economically illiterate. For the Left, specifically, a further flaw is the rank ahistoricism of the idea that America is uniquely deserving of progressive rage -- a notion that Unjust skillfully dismembers. Few would deny -- and Rothman readily concedes -- that the United States has at times failed to meet the obligations set forth in its founding documents. But all must acknowledge that this nation has taken incredible strides in the direction of equality and racial reconciliation -- strides, Rothman argues, ""that are unrivaled by any other culturally heterogeneous nation in any similar span of human history."" A failure to recognize that work is a sign not only of ingratitude but of intellectual laziness.

Indeed, intellectual laziness is perhaps the most compelling explanation that Rothman offers for the enduring popularity of social-justice activism on the left. Any idiot (my term) can follow Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter or unearth a micro-aggression or two. Few Americans -- few humans -- have the time and inclination to participate in meaningful policy debates or to practice sustaining an argument. ""It takes work to know what you're talking about,"" Rothman points out. Social-justice activism is attractive precisely because it provides ""a convenient method by which the ill-equipped can engage in politics and be taken seriously.""

Like any work of similar scope and ambition, Unjust has its share of imperfections. Though Rothman's argument is consistently persuasive, the book's organization feels unintuitive at times, and a stronger ligature of connective tissue would have occasionally been welcome. So, too, is it the case that Unjust's forays into the historical roots of social justice are underdeveloped and could conceivably have been saved for another project. (To be fair, it may be impossible to pull off at any length a survey whose points include both early-American attitudes toward Iberian Catholicism and ethnic tensions in Soviet-controlled Europe.)

Yet these are, in the end, minor quibbles. Woven into Rothman's generally excellent tapestry are individual threads that are very nearly worth the price of the book on their own. Among these are a fascinating short history of the John Birch Society, a lucid critique of the corporate hypocrisy that birthed the statue Fearless Girl on Wall Street, and an engaging examination of the rise and fall of Mic, a click-bait factory whose editorial focus was best summed up by the words of a former staffer: ""I think a lot of people in today's day and age want to know, 'What are we supposed to be outraged about?'""

It's difficult to imagine a more thorough diagnosis than Rothman's of the condition that now afflicts us. Whether a cure can be had is, of course, a different matter, and on that subject Unjust is surprisingly hopeful. In part, Rothman's optimism is due to the fact that social justice is in many cases meted out in a closed loop. ""More often than not,"" he reminds us, ""the people who face retribution"" for social-justice-related offenses ""are social justice enthusiasts themselves."" Conservatives can avoid a great deal of punishment merely by withholding the ""complicity"" that is required of victims in the form of false apologies and groveling. And in the longer term? The solution, Rothman suggests, lies with ""Democratic lawmakers of stature,"" who ""must communicate in clear terms why the social justice left's brand of politics is not only a dead-end but also a threat to the egalitarian system they profess to love.""

Will such a champion arise in the frenzied election season to come? I have my doubts. But he or she would deserve some Republican votes.",513,nationalreview.com,The Social-Justice Movement's Unjust Crusade | National Review
"Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse, by Timothy P. Carney (Harper, 368 pp., $27.99)

Donald Trump is president because he won the votes of people who agreed with his stark, and startling, declaration: The American dream is dead. So argues Timothy P. Carney, a longtime editor at the Washington Examiner, in his new book.

The political class, the pundits, and most party apparatchiks discounted Trump's chances in the Republican primaries and the general election because they come from the places where the American dream is still alive. Carney does some reporting in and analysis of these thriving places, such as Chevy Chase, Md., one of the richest neighborhoods, in both money and community life, in the country. He also looks at highly religious places in Mormon Utah and the historically Dutch Calvinist sections of Western Michigan. What is the difference between the places where the dream is dead and where it still lives? Civil society -- schools, networks, associations, intact families, and, perhaps most important, churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques.

Carney's thesis is borne out by the data. He writes, ""In the 2016 Republican primaries and caucuses, across more than three thousand counties in the United States, only about 1 percent of counties gave Donald Trump less than 20 percent of the vote. We listed three of them above -- Arlington, Alexandria, and Montgomery Counties -- the most educated counties in the country. The rest, among counties with at least twenty thousand in population, are all, with one exception, exceptionally Mormon (at least 47 percent Mormon) or exceptionally Dutch (at least 25 percent Dutch).""

Carney shows that the conservative communities that voted for Ted Cruz over Donald Trump, filled with church-goers, are in many ways similar to the rich communities around the D.C. Beltway or in New York suburbs that went for the more moderate John Kasich. Both types of communities have lots of intact two-parent families and heavy involvement of parents in the local schools and civic institutions. Church attendance is higher in the most conservative healthy communities than in the rich communities. In the latter, networks built around college and the workplace serve a similar function.

In Carney's telling, the destruction of community is not merely the product of individual vice but comes about through the deterioration of the institutions in which people exercise and learn virtue. That includes the factory and the church, which disappear in tandem. A dense network of civic life makes forming and keeping families together easier. It makes finding new jobs easier, and it sustains people during the loss of work, the common stresses of life, and even tragedy.

He writes:

The disappearance of reliable jobs and the erosion of local community may look like two different things that happen in the same places. In a crucial way, though, they are the same thing. Cohesive communities and a regular workplace are both institutions of civil society. Institutions of civil society provide material resources, such as pay and a support structure, but they also provide more abstract resources such as a sense of security and a sense of purpose. If pay and family stability go together, it's because both depend on the same thing: social capital.

Fewer reliable jobs, less marriage, and less civil society are all manifestations of the same phenomenon: Life for the working class is becoming deinstitutionalized.

While Trump supporters overall look like good earners on paper, they are heavily concentrated in places that are distressed. Drawing on the work of the journalist Ben Casselman, Carney shows that areas that have lots of subprime mortgages, people receiving disability benefits, or low earnings among full-time workers usually demonstrate higher levels of support for Trump.

Carney relies heavily on social-science research from the economist David Autor about the shock of deindustrialization on the social health of communities and even on the physical health of men without work. He draws on the work of the demographer Nicholas Eberstadt on prime-age men who drop out of the work force: They don't just leave the work force, they vacate almost all social life entirely. Men who don't have work tend not to be married and tend to contribute almost nothing to community life. They gaze at screens all day, get fat and sick, and die younger than working men.

Carney writes sensitively about how the loss of jobs is not merely a matter of lost wages. And he understands that the ""marriageability"" of men cannot be reduced to the question of income. ""China's rise did hurt many parts of the country by lowering wages and killing jobs,"" he writes.

Higher unemployment rates, though, didn't reflect all the harm, and this is the key. People in these areas were more likely to simply drop out of the workforce. They also were more likely to draw disability benefits from Social Security. That is, low-skilled manufacturing workers didn't just see their wages fall; many of them became men who counted themselves as unfit to work.

However, looking at studies and doing some gumshoe reporting about men who suddenly saw their incomes surge in the fracking boom showed Carney that a sudden gusher of money alone didn't dramatically improve marriage or legitimacy rates. High but unstable incomes in fracking boom towns, or in a gig economy, seemed to teach men the opposite qualities of those needed in marriage. Their personal lives mirrored their professional lives in volatility; these men learned not to get too attached, to look out for better opportunities, and that you should cut your losses once things look like they're going south.

But Carney cautions against judgmentalism. ""If we see the problem as primarily a dissolution of civil society, a collapse of community, then it becomes clear that 'idleness,' if you want to call it that, can be understood not as a sin but as an affliction,"" he writes. ""These people have been deprived of meaningful things to do.""

In places such as Oostburg, Wis., and Salt Lake City, Carney looks at the effect a dense network of religious institutions can have in buoying the lives of individuals and giving them a sense that their talents are worth developing, because they themselves are needed in the community. People who pray and volunteer at church are happier. He also found that the way Mormons institutionalize giving facilitates not just the virtue of charity but also accountability among members of a community. The same patterns of high sociability, high levels of satisfaction, and high achievement could be observed among American Muslims who practice their religion in an institutional way.

Alienated America moves the debate beyond the ""cultural reaction"" and ""economic anxiety"" explanations for Trump's rise by finding a cause that explains both at once: the decline and dissolution of institutions in civil society. In some ways, Carney's thesis about the American dream is a very convenient one for conservatives. Because the institutions of community life can't be reconstituted by fiat, there is not much the federal government can do to intervene productively. Because the de-institutionalization of community life has a number of overlapping causes, the populist tendency to blame heartless elites seems almost beside the point.

Well, almost. Federal economic and trade policy do in fact help determine the composition and character of the American work force. And, presumably, trade policy is partly shaped by the just-so stories policymakers tell themselves about how good the transition to a gig-and-service economy will be. And perhaps there are other policies, such as mass immigration, or the federal subsidization of student-loan debt, that are very good for people in wealthy and thriving places but destructive of community life elsewhere. Carney can't be expected to conduct his own enormous longitudinal studies to determine the effects of these things. But, reading through his well-organized rafts of social-science data and sociological analysis, I kept having intuitions about what other questions we might ask, what other culprits we might find.

First there is the issue of increased mobility. I'd be curious to see whether the falling financial and social price of emigration within countries and internationally is precisely what has reinforced the strong civic character and booming economies in places like Chevy Chase, even as it creates a brain drain from smaller or less lucky locations. At the same time, although Carney makes use of Robert Putnam's work in Bowling Alone about the discomfiting relationship between rising diversity and declining social trust, there is some evidence that the neighborhood churn caused by mass immigration and corresponding white flight may be leading to a decline of institutions in those communities.

Secondly, I wonder whether falling fertility rates play a larger role than is acknowledged in civil dissolution. Populist nationalism took hold in Russia after its fertility rates plunged in the 1990s to levels portending national suicide. During that period, Russia also experienced the kind of lifespan declines and substance abuse we see in some populations in America. There may be a similar dynamic in Central Europe now.

Carney is very eloquent on how unions and unskilled factory work help men at the lower end of the working class acquire and strengthen moral habits that are useful for keeping a marriage together. Work becomes another school of sociability and virtue. A stable marriage not only makes men more social, it allows women to contribute more to the community. But what if there is a preschool of virtue before work? Namely, sharing the home with siblings. Falling fertility rates and rising divorce rates mean that most children raised today share their home's resources with fewer people from the time they are born. It seems intuitive that children who get less practice at home interacting with various personalities -- learning to assert themselves and humble themselves -- may be less equipped to keep civic institutions running when they become adults.

Carney shows how elites make great use of educational and professional networks. I'd like to see researchers do more work exploring how shrinking kin networks -- falling fertility rates mean fewer cousins, aunts, and uncles too -- result in smaller professional networks for the working class.

And finally, Carney's book had me wondering about theological and social developments in the churches that have largely disappeared from working-class communities. In 2003, Father Paul Mankowski, S.J., explored the failure of Catholic clergy to confront the problem of sexual abuse and arrest the decline of the Church. He lingered over the class element at work:

The beneficial symbiosis between the clerical culture and the working class has disappeared as well. In most parishes of which I'm aware the priests know how to talk to the professionals and the professionals know how to talk to the priests, but the welders and roofers and sheet-metal workers, if they come to church at all, seem more and more out of the picture. I think this affects the Church in two ways: on the one hand, the Catholic seminary and university culture has been freed of any responsibility to explain itself to the working class, and notions of scriptural inspiration and sexual propriety have become progressively detached from the terms in which they would be comprehensible by ordinary people; on the other hand, few priests if any really depend on working people for their support. In a mixed parish, they are supported by the professionals; in a totally working class parish, they're supported by the diocese -- i.e., by professionals who live elsewhere. That means not only does father not have to account for his bizarre view of the Johannine community, but he doesn't have to account for the three evenings a week he spends in lay clothes away from the parish.

Did an overemphasis in the Anglophone Catholic world on the priest as a ""gentleman"" contribute to the mutual withdrawal of working classes and the Church? Did seminaries, like colleges generally, become institutions that facilitated a social secession of the overclass from the working class? Or did the theological revolutions of the mid 20th century put an emphasis on abstract theological debates at the expense of the workaday practice of piety? Unfortunately, most of these are questions unlikely to occur to social scientists and social historians.

But until they do, in this volume we have Carney's sensitive reporting and analysis combined with the best existing social science on declining working-class fortunes, splintering working-class families, and the dissolution of community life in America. Alienated America is the best place for conservatives -- or anyone of goodwill -- to start when thinking about the future of American politics and society. Readers of this book cannot fail to become more familiar with their country, and more alarmed by its condition. One hopes they are inspired to give more of their resources -- not just money, but their time and their judgment -- to their churches, their Little Leagues, and their local governments.",514,nationalreview.com,The American Dream is Crumbling | National Review
"Fifty years later, what are the lessons of the chaotic year 1969 for our similarly schizophrenic age of polarization, civil disunity, and unprecedented wealth and scientific advancement?

Fifty years ago, the United States was facing crises and unrest on multiple fronts. Some predicted that internal chaos and revolution would unravel the nation.

The 1969 Vietnam War protests on the UC Berkeley campus turned so violent that National Guard helicopters indiscriminately sprayed tear gas on student demonstrators. Later that year, hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of major cities as part of the ""Moratorium to the End the War in Vietnam."" In Washington, D.C., about a half-million protesters marched to the White House.

Native American demonstrators took over the former federal prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay and stayed there for 19 months, declaring it their own sovereign space.

In November 1969, the American public was exposed to grotesque photos of the My Lai Massacre, which had occurred the year before. The nation was stunned that American troops in Vietnam had shot innocent women and children. My Lai heated up the already hot national debate over whether the Vietnam War was either moral or winnable.

Meanwhile, the trial of the so-called Chicago Seven, involving the supposed organizers of the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, roiled the nation. The courtroom drama involving radical defendants such as Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, and Jerry Rubin descended into a national circus, as the battle between leftists and the establishment went from the streets to the courtroom.

It was also the year of the Woodstock music festival. More than 400,000 thrill-seekers showed up on a small farm in the Catskill Mountains in August 1969 to celebrate three days of ""peace and music."" Footage of free love and free drugs at Woodstock shocked half the country but resonated with the other half, which viewed the festival as much-needed liberation for an uptight nation.

Newly inaugurated president Richard Nixon characterized the national divide as the ""silent majority"" of traditional Americans fighting back against radical changes in culture and politics.

Under the strain of constant protests, the cultural and moral fabric of the country seemed to be tearing apart. Alternative lifestyle choices sometimes led to violence or death.

When a West Coast version of Woodstock was tried a few months later in Altamont, Calif., the concert ended up an orgy of murder, drug overdoses, random violence, and destruction of property.

In July of 1969, liberal icon Teddy Kennedy ran his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Mass., and his young passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, was left to drown. Senator Kennedy did not report the accident to authorities until ten hours later.

The next month, members of hippie psychopath Charles Manson's ""family"" butchered seven innocents in Los Angeles, among them actress Sharon Tate. The Manson family apparently had hoped that the sensationalized murders would ignite some sort of racial civil war, thereby unraveling the United States.

Yet a wounded United States did not just survive 1969, but reached new heights of scientific, technological, and cultural achievement.

For the first time in history, a national economy produced more than $1 trillion worth of goods and services in a single year, as American nominal GDP for 1969 exceeded that level.

America also put the first humans on the moon in 1969 -- and did it twice the same year, with the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar missions.

Boeing's 747 jumbo jet made its first successful test flight in 1969. The 400-passenger airliner was so well designed and ahead of its time that it continues in service today, a half-century after its rollout. It took some 35 years for a European company to introduce a competitor to the 747, the Airbus A380. Yet the latter jet has been something of a white elephant. Many airlines have stopped using the A380, and Airbus has announced that it will stop producing the jets in 2021.

American computer scientists first used a precursor to the Internet in 1969, when computers at UCLA and Stanford managed to share an electronic network, known as ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).

Fifty years later, what are the lessons of the chaotic year 1969 for our similarly schizophrenic age of polarization, civil disunity, and unprecedented wealth and scientific advancement?

America is such a huge and diverse country, and so abundantly endowed with natural and human resources, that it is capable of achieving unprecedented scientific, economic, and technological breakthroughs even as its social fabric is tearing apart.

Or, put another way, while the media highlights crime, protests, grievances, and civil disorder, a majority of Americans still go to work unbothered each day.

And in a rare society with a free market, constitutional government, and individual freedom, people continue to do amazing things even amid the utter chaos around them.",515,nationalreview.com,The Continued Resilience of Quiet America | National Review
"The biggest county in America doesn't want big solar or wind projects.

It may be the largest county in America by land area, but San Bernardino County, Calif., has decided it doesn't have enough room for big wind or big solar projects. On February 28, the county's board of supervisors approved a measure that bans large renewable-energy projects on more than 1 million acres of private land.

The move provides yet another example of how the energy sprawl that inevitably comes with large-scale renewable-energy deployment is colliding with the interests of rural landowners and local governments that don't want ""green"" projects in their neighborhoods. Of course, there's no small irony that that collision is happening in California, which passed a law last year that requires utilities to be getting 60 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2030.

As Los Angeles Times reporter Sammy Roth drily noted, achieving those renewable-energy goals ""will require cooperation from local governments -- and big solar and wind farms, like many infrastructure projects, are often unpopular at the local level."" All across the country rural landowners and governments have been rejecting or restricting renewable projects, and they're doing so at the very same time that left-leaning politicians and some of the country's biggest environmental groups are claiming that the U.S. must quit using hydrocarbons and nuclear energy, and instead rely solely on renewable energy for our electricity.

In January, some 600 environmental groups, including 350.org, Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Working Group, submitted a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives, which said that the U.S. must shift to ""100 percent renewable power generation by 2035 or earlier."" It continued, saying any ""definition of renewable energy must . . . exclude all combustion-based power generation, nuclear, biomass energy, large-scale hydro, and waste-to-energy technologies."" For good measure, it said this new hypothetical electric grid must have the ""ability to incorporate battery storage and distributed energy systems that are democratically governed.""

That last bit about ""democratically governed"" is the issue in San Bernardino County and elsewhere. The new regulation requires that more than half of the energy produced by new renewable projects in San Bernardino County, which covers more than 20,000 square miles, must be used in local communities. If they don't meet that standard, the projects won't be approved. In other words, San Bernardino County, which is already home to two big thermal-solar projects, including Ivanpah and Abengoa Mojave, doesn't want to be an energy plantation for people who live in other places.

This isn't the first time that California regulators have rejected renewables. In 2015, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of an ordinance banning large wind turbines in the county's unincorporated areas. During a hearing on the measure, then-supervisor Michael D. Antonovich said that ""wind turbines create visual blight."" In addition, he said, the skyscraper-sized turbines would ""contradict the county's rural dark skies ordinance which aims to protect dark skies in areas like Antelope Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains.""

There are numerous other examples of the growing land-use conflicts around renewable-energy projects. Rural residents in Spotsylvania County, Va., are fighting a proposed 500-megawatt solar project that, if built, would cover nearly ten square miles. According to the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star, local residents believe ""the project is too big to be near homes and that it poses potential health and environmental risks. They also are concerned about impacts to property values.""

In Henry County, Ind., more than half a dozen small communities have passed measures banning wind turbines within four miles of their borders. In an article last year titled ""County Towns Putting Up Walls Against Wind,"" Darrel Radford, a reporter for the New Castle Courier-Times, wrote that ""there's still lots of anti-turbine activity"" in the county and that ""as many as half"" of the incorporated communities in the county had passed anti-wind measures.

The land-use fights over renewable energy reflect the urban-rural divide in American politics -- a divide that was obvious in the 2016 presidential race. Hillary Clinton won big in urban areas; Donald Trump dominated in rural areas. Big environmental groups and urban liberal voters like the idea of renewable energy and want more of it. But the all-renewable scenario they are pushing depends on what I call the vacant-land myth: There's an endless amount of unused, uninteresting territory out in the boondocks that's ready and waiting to be covered with energy infrastructure.

The urban-rural divide is particularly obvious in New York, which has a 50 percent renewable-electricity mandate by 2030. Despite the mandate, three upstate New York counties -- Erie, Orleans, and Niagara -- as well as the towns of Yates and Somerset, have been fighting a proposed 200-megawatt wind project called Lighthouse Wind for four years. In an interview on Wednesday, I asked Dan Engert, the supervisor in Somerset, about the urban-rural divide and how it affects the promotion and siting of renewable-energy projects.

""Those urban voters will never have to deal with the reality of a wind project in their backyard,"" Engert told me. ""As these projects move closer to humans and where people live, you are seeing resistance in places"" across rural America.

The punchline here is obvious: The urban-rural divide in American politics is growing, and a key part of that divide is the debate over climate change and what we as a society should be doing about it. The anti-hydrocarbon, anti-nuclear Left fastidiously ignores the land-use implications of their all-renewable plans. But rural residents in places such as San Bernardino County, Somerset, and Henry County are not going to be ignored.

As Sara Fairchild, a resident of Pioneertown in San Bernardino County, told the supervisors during the hearing last week, ""These vast open areas are precious for their natural, historical and recreational qualities . . . . They are fragile, and no amount of mitigation can counter the damage that industrial-scale renewable-energy projects would cause."" She added: ""Once destroyed, these landscapes can never be brought back.""",516,nationalreview.com,San Bernardino County Says No to Big Renewables | National Review
"A top Democratic super PAC that spent $133 million in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 said it no longer considers Ohio a target state for the 2020 presidential election, as it looks to align with an increasingly socialist Democratic Party.

In a memo, Priorities USA, a moneyed super PAC that supported both President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign and Clinton's 2016 run for the White House, downgraded Ohio's importance and labeled the state a ""GOP Watch,"" along with states such as Texas and Iowa.

LIBERAL 'DARK MONEY' GROUPS OUTSPENT CONSERVATIVE ONES IN 2018 ELECTIONS

The PAC now sees Ohio as less likely to flip than other swing states, such as Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and even traditionally red states like Georgia and Arizona, according to Cleveland.com.

""It's not in our initial spending plans,"" Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Priorities USA, told the outlet. ""It is in the states to watch-and-see if an investment is worth making.""

""It's not in our initial spending plans. It is in the states to watch-and-see if an investment is worth making.""

""That doesn't mean we don't think Ohio is winnable for a Democrat,"" Schwerin added. ""What we think that means is if Ohio is in play, we'll have already won the easier states and have 270 electoral votes. Our investment strategy is how to get to 270 electoral votes.""

Democratic presidential candidates generally depend on the work provided by Priorities USA, which spent $126 million against President Trump and around $6.5 in support of Clinton in 2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Trump won Ohio by 8 percentage points in 2016, while Obama won the state by 3 percentage points in 2012.

The PAC's announcement comes as the Democratic Party shifts its platform to more progressive measures - with most 2020 Democratic candidates subscribing to the utopian Green New Deal - that most Ohio residents are unlikely to embrace.

Still, some local Ohio Democrats mocked the notion that their state -- the so-called ""Mother of Presidents"" -- was no longer a swing state that a White House hopeful must carry to seal a victory.

""Any look at the actual hard-nosed data of 2018 belies what they're saying,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper told Cleveland.com. ""We were closer being blue in 2018 than we were in 2010, and two years after 2010 we were blue.""

Trump's former fixer and personal attorney provided documents that showed that ""the original date in the original draft"" of Cohen's false congressional testimony on the conclusion of failed Trump Tower negotiations was January 2016, a source familiar with the documents told Fox News. Cohen acknowledged in a guilty plea last year that he misled lawmakers in 2017 by saying he had abandoned the project in January 2016, when in fact he pursued it for months afterward as Trump campaigned for the presidency.

Cohen's latest act of cooperation with authorities comes amid reports that he directed his attorney last year to seek a possible pardon from President Trump.

"Howard Kurtz: Why the Democratic probes are giving Trump a fat target

Now that Hillary's not getting in the race -- she was never running, despite hints from her keep-hope-alive surrogates -- the spotlight has fallen squarely on the House Democrats.

And at the moment they're defining themselves as the party of investigation.

They have other problems, to be sure, from allowing their most left-wing members to give them a socialist image to struggling with a resolution condemning anti-Semitism after slurs by one of their freshmen.

But what will dominate the headlines in the coming weeks and months is their wide-ranging demands for information from 81 Trump World targets. These include current and former administration officials, family members, and people in his private businesses and foundations.

This kitchen-sink approach, in my view, is a tactical error by the Democrats that plays into President Trump's hands.

HOUSE DEMS LAUNCH EXPENSIVE TRUMP PROBE WITH SLEW OF DOC REQUESTS

Had Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary chairman who ordered the requests, spaced them out over a period of time, it wouldn't have looked like he wanted to spend the next two years tying the president in legal knots -- at least not for awhile.

Instead, he's given the president a fat target to charge that he and other committee heads ""have gone stone cold CRAZY. 81 letter[s] sent to innocent people to harass them.""

Trump said the blizzard of requests were ""a disgrace to our country,"" and his son Eric Trump said ""we're going to fight the hell out of it"" in an interview with Fox News radio. ""And we'll fight where we need and we'll cooperate where we need, but the desperation shows.""

I've been covering these battles since the Reagan administration. Congress demands documents or testimony, usually from an administration controlled by the other party, and the White House delays, refuses or invokes executive privilege.

Then the Hill has to decide whether to pass a contempt-of-Congress citation and ask a court to enforce it.

Congressional Republicans demanded tens of thousands of pages from the Obama administration, got cooperation on some of the requests and resistance on others. And how many hearings did the GOP Congress hold on Benghazi?

But the road map is clear. Trump will resist many of the requests, claim presidential harassment, and force House Democrats to take the next step -- especially on his tax returns. The battles will stretch on endlessly and most people will tune out, writing the whole thing off as politics as usual.

TLAIB SAYS SHE'LL INTRODUCE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMP THIS MONTH

Putting the hypocrisy aside, Congress has a responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch. But if the House Democrats overreach, and don't pass any bipartisan legislation (assuming the Republicans would play ball), it becomes easier for Trump to paint them as overzealous partisans.

Here's a look at how two of the major papers handled the initial announcement.

The New York Times said the ""flurry of demands...detailed the breadth and ambition of a new investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by President Trump and his administration.""

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

The paper said Nadler had ""opened perhaps the most perilous front to date for Mr. Trump -- an inquiry that takes aim at the heart of his norm-bending presidency and could conceivably form the basis of a future impeachment proceeding.""

It was not until the 15th paragraph that Sarah Huckabee Sanders was quoted as calling the probe a ""disgraceful and abusive...fishing expedition.""

The Washington Post said the ""far-reaching"" request ""cast a spotlight on the ambitious strategy of the committee with the authority to impeach a president.""

The request was ""broad"" rather than ""targeted,"" and ""the extensive scope could bolster claims by Trump and Republicans that congressional Democrats are seeking to undermine the president and cripple his 2020 reelection effort rather than conduct a disciplined, fact-finding inquiry.""

As part of the more balanced piece, Sanders was quoted in the sixth paragraph.

"During a Senate hearing this afternoon, Republican senator Martha McSally (Ariz.) revealed publicly for the first time that she had been ""preyed upon and then raped"" by a superior officer when she was serving in the Air Force.

Jill Filipovic, a progressive attorney and feminist writer, decided that McSally's heartrending story would make a good launching pad for reminding her Twitter followers that conservatives don't care about preventing violence against women:

Filipovic went on to note that McSally supported the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, as if this is sufficient evidence that she doesn't care about eliminating assault, and the entire thread implied that the senator is complicit in a culture of violence against women merely because she's a conservative.

This moment shouldn't be ""complicated"" at all, nor should it be about left-wing politics, the conservative movement, or third-wave feminism. There is no reasonable way to argue that McSally's story is evidence of the Right's failure to take sexual violence seriously or attempt to prevent it.

What's more, it is third-wave feminists who so often insist that women's accounts of assault always must be taken on their own terms, believed wholesale, and treated with total deference. Had a conservative commentator attempted to use a Democratic politician's account of sexual assault to make a political argument, surely feminist pundits would have been outraged.

Filipovic pointed out, after I criticized her commentary, that she had called McSally ""brave"" and said that this is ""an important moment."" But those qualifications in no way negate or alleviate the fact that she used someone else's vulnerability to hammer home a political point, and an inaccurate one at that.

""I think McSally is incredibly brave for speaking out,"" she reiterated. ""I also believe the American right has done significant harm to rape survivors and other women who have experienced violence.""

But Filipovic produced not a shred of evidence to substantiate this claim, aside from noting that ""men who closely adhere to gender stereotypes are men who are more likely to harm women"" and claiming that the GOP ""pushes those stereotypes.""

Using McSally's story as a moment to criticize the GOP becomes even more ridiculous given that the Republican senator herself spoke today about how her experience led her to advocate changing policy to prevent future assaults. McSally said that she observed ""weaknesses in the processes involving sexual assault prevention, investigation, and adjudication"" while in the military and that her experience led her to ""make recommendations to Air Force leaders, shaped my approach as a commander, and informed my advocacy for change while I remained in the military and since I have been in Congress.""

Debate over how particular policies and broader political optics affect the incidence of sexual assault is all well and good, though I'm highly wary of the third-wave feminist tendency to blame the conservative movement for violence against women without any effort to substantiate those claims. McSally's story of having been raped is not an appropriate vehicle for the airing of those grievances.",520,nationalreview.com,Martha McSally's Sexual-Assault Story Isn't about Feminist Politics | National Review
"Judge Napolitano's Chambers: Judge Andrew Napolitano explains why President Trump should take the allegations by Michael Cohen seriously, and not deride and mock them on social media.

In an ideal world, the president of the United States would succeed in negotiating a nuclear arms treaty with a foreign government -- and do so with full congressional support; his lawyer would respect the attorney-client privilege and not reveal confidences publicly; Congress would abide the old adage that politics ends where the water's edge begins and lie low when the president is overseas on a delicate mission; the president would not engage in a grievous constitutional overreach that provokes a congressional negation; no one in his administration would have a top-secret security clearance who failed to be truthful to the law enforcement and intelligence folks investigating him; and the president would not fear RICO.

But we do not live in an ideal world -- and all of these issues and events came to our consciousness last week.

Here is the back story.

JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO: TRUMP'S BRAZEN, UNCONSTITUTIONAL OVERREACH

President Donald Trump traveled to Vietnam last week to engage in negotiations with Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. Normally, when the president of the United States meets with a foreign leader to consummate an agreement between the countries, the actual meeting is a formality and a public relations triumph.

That's because normally, emissaries from the two countries have been meeting for months, hammering out the details of an agreement. It is in the private hammering-out that the real work of diplomacy is done, not in the public handshaking and backslapping.

But Trump's foreign policy approach is anything but normal. Trump knew when he left Washington for Hanoi that there was no agreement between the countries, and he also knew that no agreement was likely. But he believed that the force of his towering personality could produce a meeting of the minds. Most of North Korea is economically desperate and physically starving and wants U.S. economic sanctions lifted. The U.S. is justly fearful of nuclear weapons in the hands of a madman that might be able to reach Los Angeles and wants the weapons gone.

It could be that neither side was willing to budge, or the war-thirsty John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser -- whose views on the use of military force for diplomatic purposes Trump ran against in 2016 -- may have prevailed upon his boss.

While the world watched the pseudo-negotiations in Hanoi, House Democrats were conducting a public hearing, over the objections of their Republicans colleagues, about Trump's alleged unlawful behavior before and while he was president. The sole witness at the hearings was Michael Cohen, a convicted perjurer and Trump's former lawyer. Cohen claimed personal knowledge of Trump's alleged -- and denied -- criminal and fraudulent behavior.

Can a lawyer testify against his own client? What has become of the attorney-client privilege? These are sound questions that were not asked last week because of something called the crime-fraud exception.

Normally, all communications between a client and his lawyer are privileged from revelation. The exception comes when the lawyer can demonstrate that he and the client were together engaged in criminal or fraudulent acts. Cohen alleged as much, made out a basic case supported by documents, gave the Democrats a fertile field of alleged Trump misdeeds to harvest and was permitted to reveal under oath and on national television countless sordid communications he had with Trump, including in the White House.

Trump claimed that Cohen's explosive allegations actually interfered with his negotiations in Hanoi and were the proximate cause of their failure.

While this was happening, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate were joining their House colleagues in opposition to the president's expenditure of funds that Congress had expressly declined to authorize. The likely rebuke would come by way of a legal mechanism to negate the president's emergency declaration, which he claims permits him to spend unused but unauthorized funds on his promised border wall. He would no doubt veto this negation.

While all this was going on, The New York Times revealed that the FBI and the CIA declined to authorize a top-secret security clearance for the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, because they claimed he was less than candid with them and that the president overruled them.

It was lawful for the president to do this, but it was extremely dangerous and profoundly unwise. It undermined the intelligence and law enforcement communities, demeaned those who obtained such clearances by hard work and merit, and has exposed the nation's most carefully guarded secrets to a person who American intelligence believes is naive and susceptible to foreign inducements to reveal what he knows.

Hidden in the Cohen testimony was an oblique reference to alleged bank and tax fraud that Cohen claimed he helped Trump commit, contributed to Trump's wealth and has the present interest of federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Many of these events took place more than five years ago and thus are not subject to federal prosecution, so why would prosecutors be interested in them?

Here is where RICO comes in. RICO is the acronym for a Nixon-era federal statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, originally enacted to target the mob. It permits federal prosecutors to reach back 10 years to find any two criminal acts, which need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; prosecutors need only demonstrate that they were more likely than not to have occurred. Then the feds can seize three times the wealth that the perpetrators of these schemes amassed. That could bankrupt Trump.

The president has serious and powerful tormentors whom he cannot overcome by mockery alone. He needs to do more than demean them with acerbic tweets, because many of those tormentors can legally cause him real harm. He needs to address these issues soberly, directly and maturely. Can President Trump survive all this? Yes -- but not if he has another week like the last one.",521,Fox News,Judge Andrew Napolitano: Trump has serious and powerful tormentors. Can he survive?

In the EW interview, Larson responded to a question about her character's relationship with Monica Rambeau, played by actress Lashana Lynch, and Larson replied that the whole point was to portray ""intersectional feminism"":

To show that, that's incredibly powerful and gripping, and you could go to the ends of the Earth and fight till the end for your best friend. It's perfect to me and so meaningful. To me, that's a part of what the meditation of this movie is: It's female strength, but what is female strength? What are the different ways that can look?

For her part, Lynch had another idea about what her Rambeau character represented.

In an interview with Nerdist, Lynch celebrated her character's single motherhood as a beau ideal.

""Her being a fighter pilot along with a single mother is her superhero quality,"" Lynch told Nerdist. ""That is absolutely her superpower. Being a single mother, especially a Black single mother, having been raised by one and my grandmother, I know that there's just a certain type of strength that comes ancestrally.""

Meanwhile, a fight is brewing among critics who seem to have watched two different films.

A compilation of reviews published by EW reveals some critics saying that Captain Marvel is a ""mundane"" film ""marked by unimaginative plotting,"" a ""generic"" superhero film, a film that does not ""approach the ranks of top tier Marvel movies,"" or a grim film where no one seems to be having much fun. But other critics who focus solely on the feminism of the film want to proclaim Captain Marvel a success based only on that feminist metric.

Actor James Woods spoke to the controversy by noting that maybe America should ""pick a movie where the studio doesn't hate half its audience.""",522,Breitbart,'Captain Marvel' Star Says Film is About 'Intersectional Feminism'
"The Krassenstein brothers are the Diamond and Silk of the Left, absurd partisans for our deeply silly age.

Where did they come from, where will they go? I'm talking about the Brothers Krassenstein, the duo that sets Resistance hearts aglow.

Here's the quick rundown: Ed and Brian Krassenstein are twin brother political activists who post second-by-second cringe-tastic takes about their righteous opposition to President Donald Trump and their love of mainstream Democratic politicians and policy. The pair are ever on a quixotic holy crusade against the two-headed hydra of Trump-Putin and are singularly focused on the apparently ever-impending impeachment of the president. The Krassensteins form a core for Resistance Twitter, a zone of maudlin anti-Trump takes and simmering rage-a-holic dumpster fires not wholly dissimilar in tone and intelligence to the outrage-a-day factory on the MAGA Right. They're a pitch perfect representation of the political age the West is currently experiencing -- a manic episode that no medication appears able to treat.

If the Krassensteins didn't exist, MAGA Twitter would have to invent them: a pair of comically buff brothers who stand in as kind of wannabe superheroes for the Resistance. They're the perfect blend of self-righteous indignation and near-subterranean-level stupid blended with tired partisan posturing that has proven so ineffective at opposing Trump and his administration. How many of their combined 1.5 million followers are bots we'll never know, but their history of alleged rampant corruption and vast Ponzi schemes only makes the picture more complete. The brothers' home was raided in September 2016 and prosecutors allege they engaged in fraudulent online activity, bilking people with gold scams and other classic hijinks. A civil asset forfeiture was also filed against the Krassensteins in the summer of 2017.

It only makes sense that two Florida golf shirt-wearing gold-scam bros would be icons of opposition to a president who is himself a semi-Floridian clich√© slouching at his Mar-A-Lago Winter White House.

Anti-Trump figures like the Krassensteins, and their counterparts on the pro-Trump side like Diamond and Silk (Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson), remind us of a kinder, gentler, and faker time when people still had the luxury of pretending to believe (or actually believing?) that real life was like a Batman comic book with good guys and bad guys fighting each other in a cosmic drama. Diamond and Silk are two black woman video bloggers who rose to fame during the last election thanks to their strong and sassy support of Trump. Swayed by his announcement (""It was on and poppin'"") they went on to open rallies for Trump and appear frequently on right-wing cable news. They and the Krassensteins of the world are tap-dancing tag teams of tortuous Philistinism, just about the last thing today's politics needs. They are funny, sure, but also quite sad. There's a lot of talk about the Middle Ages being the ""Dark Ages,"" but one has to wonder what a Medieval monk might think scrolling through the social media feeds of modern American partisans.

Congressman Steve King, Republican of Iowa, brought Diamond along to the recent State of the Union Address, surely to troll accusations that he's a white nationalist and racist -- a par-for-the-course, cringeworthy move typical of establishment politicians. Liberals, meanwhile, can always retweet a Krassenstein zinger expressing outrage over Trump's authoritarianism -- without having to actually do anything else. The Krassensteins are the ""I have black friends"" of the Left in terms of pseudo-political action. I retweeted five ""Krassenslams"" a day on Twitter, said the unemployed grocery clerk in a post-Trump presidency after the dollar collapses. I did my part! Don't look at me!

For the Brothers Krassenstein, Trump is both the blundering fool and the sinister mastermind of every given moment. The two are just the kind of sheltered individuals who think ""much of the hate"" in America today is because of Trump, a singularly ignorant and privileged viewpoint considering the amount of racism and inequality that prevailed prior to Trump.

As Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote about the far more interesting The Brothers Karamazov: ""Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.""

The problem with partisanship is that it presents false paradigms, package deals, and reductionist choices that detach us from the truly vital questions of daily conduct, community, meta-politics, meaning, and transcendence. Entertainment politics of the kind peddled by Diamond and Silk and the Krassensteins dumb us down to sloganeering mobs. (Beto O'Rourke ""talks about tearing down walls yet he lives in a house supported by walls,"" explained Diamond, that modern-day Plato, on Fox and Friends). Such an out-of-touch mindset permeates our media culture, where all clicks are worth the same amount of advertising cents and cable news blares ""he said she said"" garbage unworthy of Pravda.

We'd all like to believe we're basically the good guys and life is a giant football game. The problem is that eventually some of us grow up. And given the record low ratings for Congress, the burgeoning ranks of independent voters, and the low levels of trust in national news media, that some has become quite a large number. Not everyone -- very few, in fact -- fit into a category that celebrates celebrities who wear USSR jerseys with ""TRUMP"" on the back. Many still have an inner sense of cringe and just can't stomach all this. They are -- maybe, just maybe -- concerned over the real problems with Trump's presidency and the world, not elaborately concocted conspiracy theories and feel-good Hollywood boosterism.

Perhaps the Krassensteins' duet of ""Come Back Barack"" will invoke the return of President Barack Obama and his benign army of loving rainbow drones. Why not? After all, we are living in very silly -- and very serious -- times.",523,The American Conservative,Meet the Twin Dumpster Fires of Resistance Twitter
"Nothing. That should teach us most of the world's crises are none of Washington's business.

America is the essential nation, the unipower, the country that stands taller and sees further than all others. So naturally it must meddle, righting wrongs, fixing problems, enforcing peace, protecting allies, punishing evildoers, preserving order, and so much more. Never mind that it does all this poorly, inconsistently, and often disastrously, creating new and even greater problems as it goes. Washington policymakers can't allow any crisis to go unsolved.

Yet uncharacteristically, in Kashmir, there has been no American rush to make the lion lie down with the lamb. Two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, recently went closer to the brink than at any time since their 1971 war. The result could have been catastrophic.

Yet Washington apparently realized that it had limited influence in both Islamabad and New Delhi. Both nations were dealing with a potential existential crisis and not inclined to listen to others. The United States decided it could do little more than issue peaceful appeals.

This response should become a model for the future.

The world is full of geopolitical upsets, national implosions, military conflicts, internal collapses, humanitarian tragedies, political instabilities, and regional hostilities. The U.S. can safely ignore most of them. Indeed, America's safety usually requires ignoring them. Intervening puts Americans at risk for little potential gain. Consider the other candidates for the South Asia ""do nothing"" model.

Impoverished, dictatorial Venezuela. The implosion of what was once a wealthy nation is tragic. But while the ongoing crisis has been disruptive to Venezuela's neighbors, most obviously Colombia, it's had little impact on America. Our attempts at intervention are inevitably tainted by more than a century of ""Yankee imperialism"" in Latin America. Washington's sanctions, meanwhile, have intensified popular hardship without so far unduly discomfiting regime elites.

Starving people into revolt has rarely succeeded. Triggering a civil war would kill and destroy without guaranteeing anyone a better future. Direct military intervention would be even worse, opening an international Pandora's Box while leaving America responsible for the potentially disastrous consequences. Instead, Washington should back the efforts of Venezuela's neighbors and other Latin American nations to peacefully defuse the crisis.

Defense-dependent South Korea. The Cold War is long over. The Korean peninsula is no longer tied to a larger global struggle. The South has raced past its northern antagonist and is well able to defend itself. America and North Korea are attempting to reconcile.

The U.S. should withdraw its garrison and end its security guarantee. The North's acquisition of nuclear weapons, which it is unlikely to abandon, makes that withdrawal even more imperative. The U.S. does not want to be drawn into a new Korean conflict in which nuclear-tipped missiles could be launched against the American homeland. Nothing on the peninsula warrants such a risk. Better for Seoul to build a countervailing nuke than for Washington to remain entangled in a multi-sided nuclear confrontation.

Ukraine in search of defense. Uncle Sam has the reverse Midas touch, turning most everything he touches into conflict. So it is with Ukraine. That land was part of Imperial Russia and then the Soviet Union. The latter's collapse gave it an opportunity, but Kiev suffered under a succession of authoritarian, ineffective, and corrupt presidents.

America's backing of Ukraine's inclusion in NATO further angered Russia, which was already upset over our support for previous eastward alliance expansions. In 2014, Washington's and Europe's endorsement of a street putsch against the elected, Russia-friendly president triggered Moscow's forcible annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in the Donbass.

Vladimir Putin's actions were wrong, but imagine how Washington would have reacted had Russia acted similarly in Mexico. Anyway, Ukraine matters not for U.S. security and America cannot fix internal Ukrainian politics. Russia is likely to play a disruptive role in the Donbass as long as America threatens to add Kiev to NATO. Nothing short of a devastating war will cause Moscow to disgorge Crimea. Washington should leave the mess to Europe and seek a modus vivendi with Russia.

Enduring Israel-Arab conflict. Is there a worse, more emotional, less meaningful, lengthier, more intractable, less solvable struggle than that between the Israelis and the Palestinians? Is there one more destructive of the American republic, with U.S. interests often subordinated to the desires of other governments? Washington has no reason to spend so much money and devote so much effort into what is essentially a national act of masochism.

The Middle East isn't even important for American security. The energy market has diversified and the U.S. has become a natural gas powerhouse. Washington no longer faces a global antagonist like the Soviet Union, which could attempt to disrupt the globe's energy lifeline. Israel receives religious support, most strongly from Christian evangelicals, but it is a regional military superpower. Lately it's even expanded its relations with the Gulf States, which fear Iran. Israel's chief threat is internal, since its colonization of the West Bank may force it to eventually choose between being Jewish and democratic.

The U.S. should adopt the Hippocratic Oath and first do no harm. That means ending Washington's virtual blank check to Israel.

Widening Sunni-Shiite divide. Who should Americans favor? Sunni fundamentalists ranging from Saudi royals to al-Qaeda terrorists? Or Shia extremists who seized power in Iran? Neither. Washington need not choose sides.

Perhaps nothing has so deformed U.S. policy in the Mideast as embracing the repressive Saudis and Emiratis because they back the Trump administration's anti-Iran crusade. They are not America's friends. They do not represent or promote U.S. values. And they would not advance American interests if dominant. Indeed, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Riyadh has become the most dangerous and irresponsible power in the region, starting with its murderous attack on Yemen. If various Middle Eastern countries choose to fight it out, they should do so without America's involvement.

Syria's brutal breakdown. As America has learned throughout its own history, civil wars tend to be the bitterest and bloodiest of conflicts. U.S. forces never belonged in Lebanon, taking sides during the 1980s in the midst of a score of contending factions. Libya yielded chaos, multiple governments, and power vacuums filled by the Islamic State.

Syria was far worse, a shattered Humpty Dumpty that Washington couldn't put back together again. And it didn't matter to America: Damascus did not threaten the U.S., had been allied with Moscow back during the Cold War, was unwilling to challenge Israel after losing successive wars, and was eclipsed by Washington's numerous other allies in the region. Nor were America's multiple and conflicting objectives achievable: oust President Bashar al-Assad, propel largely nonexistent moderates to victory, support radicals including al-Qaeda affiliates just enough to defeat Assad but no more, ameliorate the humanitarian consequences of fighting Washington supported, work with both Kurdish militias and the Turkish government, limit Russia's influence, and confront Iranian forces. The U.S. should get out and stay out.

Territorial controversies in the Asia-Pacific. The Philippines hopes to borrow America's Seventh Fleet to battle China over Scarborough Shoal. Japan expects U.S. aid in its squabble with Beijing over the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands to the Chinese). Vietnam looks to Washington as it contests Chinese claims to the Paracel Islands.

The U.S. has no direct interest in any of this. Washington wants to maintain freedom of navigation and promote the peaceful resolution of disputes. But it must resolutely resist its allies' attempts to drag it into military conflicts not its own. In such contests, China has far greater interests in the outcomes and is willing to spend far more and take far greater risks.

Washington's primary interest is in preserving the independence of friendly states and preventing hostile domination of Eurasia. However, those states could do much more on their own behalf, and would do so if the U.S. didn't write them a blank check for defense. Increasingly more of Washington's military budget will go towards projecting power against China, which needs to spend and do much less to deter American intervention. Washington instead should focus on the defense of its own core interests.

As the specter of nuclear war rises in South Asia, it is good to remember that not every problem on earth is America's responsibility. Indeed, most are not, or at least should not be. Washington should instead enjoy the peace in its own neighborhood that has naturally resulted from its being the globe's most powerful nation.",524,The American Conservative,What Happened When We Kept Out of the India-Pakistan Fracas?
"Trump speaks to the media in the Rose Garden at the White House on Jan. 4, 2019.Michael Candelori/Shutterstock

President Donald Trump's first veto will now likely be of the resolution seeking to block his use of emergency powers to build a border wall. Whatever the merits, that's better politics -- and more ""America First"" -- than vetoing Congress's attempt to stop U.S. support for the Yemen war.

Trump promised during the 2016 campaign to guard America's borders rather than police the world. The reason he finds himself in the position of fighting for a national emergency declaration is that he listened to lawmakers, including some influential members of his own party, whose priorities ran in the opposite direction.

Late last year when Trump began his ill-fated wall showdown and called for winding down two wars -- one that had gone on too long, the other that was never authorized by Congress or our business to fight in the first place -- it appeared he had belatedly learned this lesson.

Hope springs eternal, but contrary evidence keeps emerging. The latest is an NBC News report on a letter in which Trump appears to concur with members of Congress who want to keep a residual American force in Syria as part of a military intervention they never authorized.

""I agree 100%,"" Trump wrote above a paragraph in the letter he highlighted. ""ALL is being done."" Perhaps the mercurial president wasn't changing his mind from when he called for stopping ""endless wars"" during the State of the Union address but rather offering lawmakers some ""mission accomplished"" reassurance. I sat next to former Trump advisor Sebastian Gorka as he told an interviewer at CPAC that unlike the neoconservatives, the president's first instinct is always to bring the troops home.

But taken together with the administration's hawkish stances on Venezuela, Iran, and Yemen, as well as the interventionist tilt of Trump's foreign policy team -- John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, now even Elliot Abrams -- it is not encouraging. Trump has been constrained on Syria and Afghanistan before.

While the situation at the border has deteriorated in recent weeks with a surge of asylum-seeking migrants, Trump should have fought for his preferred immigration policies when Republicans controlled Congress and red-state Senate Democrats were at risk of losing their seats in the midterm elections. He didn't.

Democrats, as the majority party in the House, now control the power of the purse. Nancy Pelosi's chamber is where the appropriations process begins and no declaration of emergency will change that.

The president still wields considerable power over foreign policy, however. He should use it, remembering that the people telling him to wait to end the wars are largely the same crowd who wanted him to wait on the wall funding that never came.

For example, instead of fighting with Rand Paul over emergency powers, Trump should join forces with him on Afghanistan. Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, and New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall have a new bill requiring the Pentagon to plan for pulling most U.S. troops out of America's longest war.

""We've accomplished our mission in Afghanistan and it's time to bring our troops home,"" Paul told reporters. ""This has been a long war. We've spent over $2 trillion total. Twenty-three hundred have lost their lives in Afghanistan, and 20,000 wounded."" Udall added: ""It is Congress that has failed to conduct its oversight duty of this war.""

One need not retroactively condemn the war, as socialist sensation Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared to do on Twitter, in order to recognize that we have done all we can in Afghanistan. Punishing those who sheltered the 9/11 attackers was a militarily attainable goal. Turning Afghanistan into a functioning democracy is not.

Syria, like Iraq, is somewhere our troops never should have been, period. Congress apparently agrees, having never voted to approve our presence there -- even as the Senate warns against ""precipitous"" withdrawal. Trump should follow his gut on this as well rather than allow conventional Republican advisors to push him off course.

Those Republicans haven't won the White House since 2004. And many of the Democrats seeking their party's 2020 presidential nomination don't appear inclined to repeat Hillary Clinton's mistakes on foreign policy -- at least not during the campaign.

To shore up his base in the industrial states that delivered him the presidency, Trump needs to put some populist points on the board. The wall is now at least partially beyond his grasp. The wars are not.",525,The American Conservative,"Misled on the Wall, Trump Must Hold Firm Against the Wars"
"Once a year, dignitaries gather in Selma, Alabama for the annual commemoration of 1965's ""Bloody Sunday"" Edmund Pettus Bridge crossing.

During election cycles, many of those dignitaries are Democratic Party politicians, and even some seeking the highest office in the land, the United States presidency.

Last Sunday's march was such an occasion. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) participated in the event, all of which have dabbled in the arena of presidential politics. If there was a takeaway from the occasion, Democrats are looking to make voter suppression and voting rights one of the main issues of the campaign.

""[T]here is no more fundamental right than the right to vote,"" Clinton said to Selma marchers last Sunday. ""It is under attack. It is under fire. It has got to be protected. No matter what else you care about, there is nothing more important than standing up and fighting for the right to vote right now.""

It is also on the agenda of this Democrat-controlled Congress. Right out of the gate, Democrats filed H.R. 1, titled as the For the People Act of 2019. The bill, sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD), includes a number of initiatives Democrats have long advocated.

Among those items included in the nearly 600-page bill are internet, automatic and same-day voter registration, restriction on removing or purging names from voter rolls,

""H.R. 1 is a nothing but a liberal wish list and massive government overreach forcing states into a one-size-fits-all approach to administering elections,"" Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL), the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, said to Breitbart News. ""This partisan power grab was written behind closed doors by special interests aligned with the Democratic Party.""

Last month, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill testified before Rogers' committee, chaired by Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) about the integrity of the American voting system. Merrill, who has registered 1,211,906 new voters since taking office in 2015 (817,108 electronically), which raised the state's tally of registered to voters to a total of 3,468, 747, questioned the Democrats' universal approach.

""United States Senators and Members of Congress that are unwilling or unable to consider the fact that each state has unique laws and circumstances with different levels of resources must understand that the passage of H.R. 1 would create an ineffective system that will create additional hardships for the entities responsible for administering and conducting elections in their state, and potentially cause unnecessary damage to the credibility and security of our electoral process,"" Merrill said to Breitbart News. ""State leaders must be given the opportunity to build their system around their state's laws and citizens regarding elections as is indicated in the United States Constitution.""

Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow in The Heritage Foundation's Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, raised questions about the bill's infringement on constitutionally protected free speech.

""HR 1 is one of the worst bills introduced in Congress in recent memory,"" von Spakovsky said to The Daily Signal. ""Many parts of it are unconstitutional and it is full of bad and unwise provisions that will restrict free speech and grassroots political activity, as well as hamper the ability of state government to ensure the security and integrity of the election process.""

Should H.R. 1 pass the House, it is not expected to be taken up by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate under the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).

"Women's March leader Linda Sarsour led a rally on Wednesday at the steps of the Supreme Court with a large group of other leftist activists and organizations to express ""unequivocal solidarity"" with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for her recent remarks deemed anti-semitic.

The rally was in response to House Democrats drafting a resolution condemning anti-semitism in general but without naming Omar. Ahead of an unscheduled vote on it, leftists are demanding it includes broader language to condemn ""anti-Muslim sentiments"" and ""black racism.""

Sarsour, a Palestinian American activist, said the group had sent letters to ""progressive"" leaders across the country and planned to personally deliver a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office following the rally.

Nihad Awad, executive director and co-founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), claimed Omar was stating the obvious -- ""that Israel and the AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) have undue influence in our Congress and on our foreign policy.""

As Breitbart News has noted:

In 2007-8, CAIR was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the terror financing trial of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development. That case, in turn, led the FBI to discontinue its work with the organization. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that the government ""produced ample evidence to establish"" the ties of CAIR with Hamas, the Palestinian terror organization. The United Arab Emirates labeled CAIR a terrorist organization in 2014 (a decision that the Obama administration opposed).

Rabbi Alissa Wise, deputy director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said the activists would ""stop the desecration of God's name"" by ""standing together in praise of Rep. Omar for her courage, her honesty, her truth-telling, her bravery to stand up against those that insist Palestinians are not deserving of human rights.""

""That we must critic the Israeli government as it practices Apartheid,"" Wise said.

Noura Erakat, an assistant professor at George Mason University, said the ""anxiety"" that led Democrats to draft the resolution had nothing to do with anti-semitism and everything to do with ""concern for Israel's viability as an Apartheid state.""

Erakat said Palestine is now a ""progressive cause.""

Ramah Kudaimi, acting director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, had a long laundry list of Israeli misdeeds, from stealing Palestinian land to ""mass incarceration of men and boys"" and ""the targeting of civilians.""

""Rep. Omar is doing no more than asserting that Palestinian are human rights,"" Kudaimi said. ""Pro-Israel forces are trying to make an example of her due to her positionally as a black Muslim refugee woman.""

""Her support of Palestinians is an inherent and natural part of her progressive politics,"" Kudaimi said.

Phyllis Bennis of the leftwing Institute for Policy Studies said it is no longer ""political suicide"" to criticize Israel.

""It is no longer political suicide to criticize Israel,"" Bennis said. ""We now see it on college campuses we see it on streets; we see it on how people talk about the issue, and this is the change that's underway and it's part of the change that has brought extraordinary people to Congress like Rep. Ilhad Omar, like Rep. Rashida Tlaib.""

""This is an incredible generational shift; it's an incredible political shift, and we should be celebrating it,"" Bennis said. ""This is really a great moment.""

As Breitbart News reported, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters on Wednesday that the House Foreign Affairs Committee would draft a new resolution against anti-semitism, meaning that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) would be able to edit it.

Members of the Middle East Women's Coalition, which held a rally earlier on Wednesday calling for Omar to resign, briefly interrupted the rally, asking Omar supporters why they didn't speak out about Christian persecution and sex trafficking of young girls in places under Sharia law.

"Schock resigned from Congress after his expenditures raised red flags with watchdog groups and the feds.

He was charged with wire fraud and falsification of election filings, among other things. He also used taxpayer and campaign funds for private flights, tickets to the Super Bowl and the Country Music Awards, documenting much of his high-flying life on his Instagram account.

The 37-year-old former pol agreed to pay $42,000 to the IRS and another $68,000 to his congressional campaign fund.

As part of the deal, his campaign committee pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to properly report expenses.

If Schock displays good behavior for six months, his criminal record will be gone.

But even before prosecutors announced their stunning decision, Schock's return to social media signaled that things were looking up. He started posting to Instagram again last fall and is now back to regularly posting photos with celebrities, of his travels and of his abs.

Schock's over-the-top Instagram helped make his a rising star during his time on Capitol Hill, but like his audacious ""Downton Abbey"" office, it also aided his downfall.

The Associated Press used location data from his Instagram to discover that he had spent taxpayer dollars and campaign funds to pay for private flights aboard planes owned by his donors.

Speaking to CBS News Wednesday, Schock said the investigation of his spending as taken a toll.

'I've been trying to survive the last four years. When you go toe-to-toe with the federal government, they have an unlimited budget and most Americans don't,"" he told the network. ""It's come at significant cost to me financially and professionally,"" he added.

"Washington Examiner commentary editor Timothy Carney, author of Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse, described the ""destruction of a way of life"" among ""working class"" people in rural and industrial regions wrought by the status quo of globalization in a Monday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.

Mansour invited Carney to share lessons he learned about rural America's support for President Donald Trump while conversing with patrons of Smitty's Bar and Restaurant in Uniontown, PA, during the 2016 presidential election season.

""Smitty's is a roadside bar,"" said Carney:

It's not really walking distance from anything, and one of the things I learned in the 2016 election is that it definitely gives you a different slice of the electorate. The sort of bars I used to go to in previous elections were often yuppie Irish pubs. You had liberals, conservatives, old, young, but what the 2016 election taught a lot of us was that on the edge of town there were other people who might -- in the average election -- not be involved in politics but were brought in.

Carney continued, ""And sure enough, everybody at Smitty's was a Trump supporter, and we were talking about the economy, and one of the things they started talking about was how they thought a lot of people didn't work hard enough, and welfare cheats.""

Carney recalled the story of a man whose son had died following an overdose on opiates.

""One of the guys there, Dave, told me he was on disability, and I said, 'Dave, you're here on a Tuesday afternoon drinking and not at your job, and you're not retired like some of these other guys. What's going on?' And he said, 'I can't work because of my disability.'""

Carney went on, ""Now, here's the thing about Fayette County. I chose it because it has all sorts of bad economic and social indicators, and Pittsburgh nearby has actually swung back, and one of the things is a lot of men in Fayette County are on disability, and I said, 'If you can sit at this bar for three hours talking with me, why can't you work?' And he said, 'Well, I'm numb today because this morning my son died.'""

""This was an incredibly eye-opening experience for me,"" explained Carney:

Looking into his eyes and seeing on a human level that the suffering, the struggling of the working class and so much of Middle America was absolutely real, and anybody who was going to say this was an illusion, this was sort of a rhetorical flourish by Trump or this was just a grousing of the middle-aged white men who lost their privilege, really, I wish they had been there and seen the way the bar reacted. Everybody said it was opioids after Dave left.

Carney revealed, ""It was a moment for me. We cannot deny that the perception that the American Dream is dead, that perception is based in a reality.""

Sociological analyses must be broadened beyond economic determinism to fully understand people, advised Carney.

""The most important thing -- and this is a pretty old conservative insight -- is that we have to understand people in the places that they are,"" advised Carney. ""Too often, sociologists [and] economists commit what I call the fatal abstraction. They look at people on a spreadsheet. What is your age? What is your sex? What is your income?""

""Looking at people as if they're not living in a physical place is not really studying people,"" remarked Carney, ""and so more open trade can help out the U.S. economy as a whole -- in the aggregate -- but those aggregate numbers hide a lot that's going on under the surface, and particularly [in] manufacturing places that are forced to compete with China or with Mexico after NAFTA.""

Carney went on, ""In those places, what the sort of classical model would have predicted is slightly lower wages as these people move to the service sector or some other part of the economy freed up by the lower costs of goods that the rest of Americans are paying, but that's not what happened, and it's not just my anecdotal experience in places like Fayette County.""

Carney continued, ""There are economic studies by David Autor, MIT economist, showing that in the places that were competing with China, particularly, there wasn't just a small drop in wages. There's a massive increase in unemployment, there's a massive increase in dropping out of the labor force. An uptick in men like Dave, who are on disability, and an uptick in deaths of despair, such as opioids, drug overdose, and alcohol abuse.""

""So the classical economic models were based on an idea that people weren't attached to anything,"" explained Carney. ""That they weren't attached to places, that they weren't attached to neighbors, that they weren't attached to a field or a career or a job, and because people are attached to those things, when the factory shuts down -- often, again, it wasn't just a downtick in wages -- it was a destruction of a way of life.""

Human beings are not as mobile as inanimate objects when examining economic shifts, noted Mansour. ""I'm from the Motor City,"" she said, ""I've seen this again and again. When the factory closes, it destroys the community too. All across the Rust Belt, you see dotted little town like Uniontown, where the factory closes and then everything dies around it slowly.""

""And as you say, people aren't widgets,"" added Mansour. ""They can't just be interchangeable parts and just move someplace else, especially when all of the jobs are moving elsewhere and there's no way they can compete.""

Carney elaborated on the decline of social capital caused by the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs via contemporary trade practices.

""The story of Alienated America is the story of, really, a social collapse and not merely an economic one,"" stated Carney. ""On the cover of the book, there's a shuttered church, and this is because what I think defines a place where the American Dream seems dead is not just lower wages or even higher unemployment, but the loss of connectedness [and] of social cohesion. So what happens is, the factory shuts down.""

Rural areas are more vulnerable to social disruption brought about by structural economic shifts, explained Carney. He analyzed socially destructive cascading effects driven by modern globalization.

""If you just tell the economic story, that's the first domino, but the next dominoes are the real collapse of these institutions,"" Carney said. ""This is important because it means that you can't just sort of instantly rebuild it or [replace] it with some sort of welfare check. The loss is on a very human level when people lose a way of life that involves a sense of purpose and community.""

Strong institutions within civil society provide support and insurance to their members during unexpected hardships, said Carney. Such institutions are damaged or even lost when their economic nodes -- such as factories -- shut down.

""When life gets hard, you need these things you can rely on, and often it's going to be institutions of civil society,"" Carney explained:

Little platoons, most notably church, but also a Rotary Club, a swim club, a little league team, your workplace, hopefully, they provide that support, and when that factory shuts down and people start trickling out -- particularly some of the most ambitious people, the starters and go-getters in the town -- then you lose those institutions and that is not just not nice, that is deadly. Deaths of despair follow when people don't have something to provide that uplift and sense of purpose.

Elites typically overlook the importance of civic institutions among the working class and the damage caused by the breakdown of such networks.

""Elites actually tend to be more enmeshed in these really strong networks, and these really strong institutions of civil society,"" Carney pointed out:

They're more likely to belong to things like putting their kids in sports teams. They have good public schools -- which isn't just a matter of spending per pupil, obviously -- [with] lots of involved parents. There's more intact families with a mother and a father. Mom is more likely to have a part-time job in a white-collar than a blue-collar world. You've got alumni networks [and] professional networks. ... For the working class and a lot of the middle class you don't have as strong of those institutions.

Carney added, ""But the thing that drives me crazy -- I spent a lot of Alienated America talking about how the elites tend to do a lot of things right -- finish school, get a job, get married, have kids -- but they somehow don't realize that the strong communities and institutions that they have are their most valuable assets. So they don't think it's much of a loss when the working class loses them.""

Declining religiosity disproportionately damages rural areas' social capital relative to urban zones, illustrated Carney.

""So you talk about the secularization of America, I think that's really a big a problem for the working class,"" declared Carney:

For the elite, well, if they stop going to church, they've got their Sunday morning yoga, or their country club, or their strong country club. So that's one of the reasons that people would say, ""Oh, this is about deplorables. There's no real suffering out there,"" because they don't even understand the value of their own institutions, and so they greatly diminish the loss when Middle America loses their institutions.

Mansour asked Carney to examine what he characterized as ""hyperindividualism.""

""Man is a political animal,"" replied Carney. ""We are made for community. We're supposed to shape the world around us. We only live out our full potential when we are living together in a community, so anything pulling away too far from that really is hurting us.""

Carney warned of social fragmentation driven by contemporary economic, social, and technological forces.

""Cultural forces pulling us into being atomized individuals,"" stated Carney. ""[We are] no longer connected to our neighbors as much, and that really is at the root of a lot of these problems. ... I do think alienation is a problem here, and hyperindividualism is one of its causes.""

""The Democrats' attempt to drive the church out of the public square has to be stopped, and you've seen the Republican Congress and President Trump do a good job of that, reversing some of these things [like] the war on the Little Sisters of the Poor has stopped, [and] Christian adoption agencies are now legal, again. So that's the first step.""

""Thou shalt not drive the church out of the public square,"" quipped Carney. ""That's the single most important thing that Trump and the Republican Party have done.""

Mansour asked if the GOP suffers from economic myopia while failing to understand its own voter base.

""The belief that a rising GDP [gross domestic product] equals general across-the-board thriving, I think that still has too strong of a hold on the Republican party,"" assessed Carney. ""It's hard to tell for sure, but that's the worry I have, and there has to be more of an acknowledgment that people are suffering in material ways that a little bit more money or a rising GDP isn't going to solve.""

Carney concluded, ""There's a real rebuilding that has to be done and that things have kind of been rigged by the elites in favor of the elites. It's sort of an Elizabeth Warren line, but I think it's one that Republicans can actually use with more effectiveness by pointing out it's Washington doing the rigging.""",529,Breitbart,"Tim Carney on 'Alienated America': Loss of Factory, Church, Community Caused 'American Carnage'"
"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (R-NY) told a Sunday show host that Congress can impeach President Donald Trump for matters that are not crimes, and also for alleged acts that he claims Trump committed before becoming president, rejecting key limits that the Framers of the Constitution placed on Congress's impeachment power.

Nadler gave an interview to George Stephanapoulous on ABC's This Week, laying out the long-term partisan Democrat's plan to relentlessly attack President Trump, with the evident goal of ousting him from office.

""Seeking to sabotage a fair election would be an impeachable offense,"" Nadler declared, insisting that the president is ""implicated"" in ""various crimes,"" including crimes committed during the 2016 election.

Nadler's Judiciary Committee investigation will seek to establish the facts pertaining to the president's actions during the 2016 election. Nadler made clear that he has already concluded that the president is guilty of ""abuse of power,"" ""corruption,"" and ""obstruction of justice."" That last one is key, because it is a specific federal felony that could be cited as grounds for impeachment.

The left-wing Democrat accused President Trump of a laundry list of illegal activities, including little-known - and little-understood, especially by media pundits - constitutional provisions such as what he calls the ""Emoluments Clause"" of the Constitution. (There are actually two such provisions in the Constitution, the Foreign Emoluments Clause and the Domestic Emoluments Clause. It is unclear which one Nadler says the president is violating.)

But the list of allegations show that the New York partisan is quite serious, including ""abuses of power, obstruction of justice, threats to the Mueller investigation, threats to witnesses,"" and so on.

Nadler also claimed that when President Trump criticizes Robert Mueller, that criticism is obstruction of justice, which is a felony. He also claims that President Trump's firing James Comey as FBI director was obstruction of justice.

He also insists that Congress can remove the president from office for matters that are not crimes.

""So can there be impeachable offenses that are not crimes?"" asked Stephanopoulous.

""Oh, sure,"" Nadler replied. ""Crimes and impeachable offenses [are] two different things.""

Nadler's claims are shocking.

First, the Framers of the Constitution specified in Article II, Section 4, ""The President ... shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

Elsewhere, the Constitution adds that it takes a simple majority vote (50 percent plus one, or 218 in the modern House) in the House to impeach, and then a two-thirds supermajority vote (67 in the modern Senate) to remove an impeached president from office.

The Constitution gives treason and bribery as examples of impeachable crimes. The best reading of that clause could be paraphrased as, ""treason, bribery, or similarly serious crimes."" People can debate about whether lesser crimes can be treated as impeachable offenses, but they cannot debate about whether the Framers were talking about actual crimes. The Constitutional Convention debated having the Constitution say that a president could be removed for ""maladministration"" - that is, being a bad president - but deliberately decided against it.

The Democrat-led U.S. House in 1974 included abuse of power as one of the impeachment articles against President Richard Nixon. Nadler did not discuss that, but it is sometimes mentioned in impeachment discussions.

But impeaching for abuse of power is hard to reconcile with the original public meaning of the Impeachment Clause of the Constitution unless it is referring to criminal abuses of power. The 1970s were a decade that saw government officials frequently abandon the original meaning of the Constitution, perhaps most infamously with the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision - inventing out of thin air a constitutional right to abortion - but also the original meaning of the Constitution's Establishment Clause in Lemon v. Kurtzman(1971), how the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause applies to campaign-finance laws in Buckley v. Valeo(1976), and the proper scope of vital constitutional separation-of-powers principles such as Congress's War Powers Act and vast expansions of federal powers over the environment and education.

In other words, you want to take with a grain of salt conclusions about the Constitution that branches of government promulgated in the 1970s. It was not the U.S. government's finest decade in that regard.

Instead, what Nadler describes is roughly equivalent to a vote of no confidence against a British prime minister in the British system. Britain's system of Parliamentary supremacy is hard to compare in many regards to America's system of government, but the relevant difference here is that in America, the executive branch is independent from the legislative branch, separately elected by the American people through the Electoral College.

We know that Nadler and other top Democrats do not like President Trump. That fact does not entitle them to cancel the results of the 2016 presidential election. The American people gave President Trump four years in the White House, and the Constitution only allows that to be cut short for impeachable crimes.

Another disturbing aspect of Nadler's claim is that it criminalizes politics. As an American citizen, the president continues to possess free speech rights under the First Amendment to criticize the government, including Mueller. It cannot be a crime for him to do so, and thus not an impeachable offense.

Similarly, the FBI director serves at the pleasure of the president. The Appointments Clause in Article II of the Constitution provides that the president can fire at will any senior officer in government that he has the authority to fill through making a new appointment. It cannot be a crime for the president to exercise one of his core constitutional powers.

Third, all the discussion in 1787 about impeachment power during the Constitutional Convention clearly referred to acts that the president committed during his tenure as president. Nothing said during the convention in Philadelphia suggested that it was possible for Congress to remove a president for something he did before he took his oath of office.

Nadler is clearly broadening the House's impeachment profile. He says that President Trump can be impeached for non-crimes, for exercising his constitutional prerogatives, and for any act he has committed at any point during the 70-plus years that he lived as a private citizen before becoming the 45thpresident.

The American people have historically pushed back against such power grabs that threaten the constitutional separation of powers. It appears that Nadler is willing to take his chances in an effort to topple President Trump.",530,Breitbart,Gerald Nadler Rejects Constitution's Limitations on Impeaching Trump
"George Washington warned against both passionate attachments and inveterate antipathies to other nations in his Farewell Address. He correctly perceived that both strong sentiments would cause Americans to put the interests of the preferred nation ahead of our own or to lure the U.S. into unnecessary conflicts for reasons that had nothing to do with our security. The most relevant passage of the address says this:

The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject; at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations, has been the victim.

So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation [bold mine-DL].

Washington was commenting on the factionalism of his own day and criticizing the tendency of one group to favor France and another to favor Britain, but the wisdom of his remarks is timeless. The impulse to take sides with other states in their regional quarrels against their rivals is as strong and dangerous as ever, and the bad habit of conflating our interests with the interests of another state is unfortunately all too common in our foreign policy debates and our policymaking. As Washington warned, the strong attachment that supporters of a certain state will cultivate leads to ""facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists."" In practice, acting as if there is ""no daylight"" between the U.S. and another state almost always means that the U.S. ends up subordinating its interests to the interests of the other state. Because no two states will ever have consistently aligned interests, adopting an unquestioning and enthusiastic commitment to another state necessarily involves giving one's own country short shrift. In order to maintain the ""illusion of an imaginary common interest,"" it becomes necessary for the supporter to claim the other state's enemies as our own and to make their conflicts ours. This treats the other state's foes as ours simply because they are rivals with the other state. The other state is declared to be an ""ally,"" but remarkably one that has no obligations to aid our country. We see this distorted, lopsided relationship today most often with client states with which the U.S. has no formal treaties and no binding defense commitments. The less practically useful a client is to the U.S., the more its supporters insist that the relationship is absolutely vital and unquestionable. We have seen this in recent years with Saudi Arabia and our government's support for their despicable war on Yemen, and of course we have seen it for decades in the unstinting support that the U.S. has provided Israel for decades.

Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has recently came under withering attack from ""pro-Israel"" hawks in both her own party and in the GOP for having the temerity to question the influence of lobbying organizations that promote the exceedingly close U.S.-Israel relationship. She has been unfairly and falsely accused in trafficking in coded anti-Semitic rhetoric, and now she is facing condemnation from her own fellow Democrats for challenging the stranglehold that the hawkish ""pro-Israel"" view has had on Congress for decades. Paul Waldman observed that this rush to condemn Omar for bluntly stating rather obvious truths about the politics of Israel in Washington proves her right:

Now, back to Omar. Here's the truth: The whole purpose of the Democrats' resolution is to enforce dual loyalty not among Jews, but among members of Congress, to make sure that criticism of Israel is punished in the most visible way possible. This, of course, includes Omar. As it happens, this punishment of criticism of Israel is exactly what the freshman congresswoman was complaining about, and has on multiple occasions. The fact that no one seems to acknowledge that this is her complaint shows how spectacularly disingenuous Omar's critics are being.

The purpose behind the resolution is the usual effort to police the debate over Israel and Palestine and to stifle dissent that challenges the prevailing views of the leadership in both parties. Omar called attention to the absurd expectation that members of Congress have to express support for Israel, and she refused to play along. She said: ""I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee."" ""Pro-Israel"" hawks expect exactly that, but they don't like it when anyone points out that this is what is expected. That is why the people that are deeply invested in maintaining the ""illusion of an imaginary common interest"" between the U.S. and Israel are coming after her with such fury, pour encourager les autres. To her credit, Rep. Omar has not backed down in the face of the intense and dishonest attacks against her. In her first few weeks in the House, Rep. Omar has demonstrated a better grasp of the principles outlined in Washington's Farewell Address and her responsibilities as a U.S. representative than most of her colleagues. Anyone interested in a more forthright and reasonable debate on Israel and foreign policy more generally has to be grateful to her for that.",531,The American Conservative,Allegiances and Passionate Attachments
"""I'm finding my voice in terms of politics,"" Taylor Swift wrote in an Elle article published Wednesday.

""I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change,"" she wrote.

""Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers,"" Swift continued.

""Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I'm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.""

Indeed, Swift broke her longtime silence on politics last year to endorse Tennessee Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.

She endorsed former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D-TN) in his Senate race against then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), but failed to sway the race.

In her endorsement, Swift said, ""I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.""

The ""Bad Blood"" singer's article in Elle, titled, ""30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30,"" also touches on how people should believe sexual assault claims.

It's my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying ""This happened to me."" It's something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don't.

The article featured other interesting insights, like how to accept gaining weight.

""I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body,"" the 29-year-old said.

""I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.""

The ""Look What You Made Me Do"" singer also wrote that the year 2016 influenced her to drink more alcohol.

""I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm's cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because...2016.""",532,Breitbart,Taylor Swift Finally Feels 'Informed Enough' to Speak Out Against 'Disgusting Rhetoric' in Politics
"Conservative: Murphy Should Talk to McGreevey on Taxes

Having just proposed a hike in New Jersey's millionaire's tax, Gov. Phil Murphy should have a chat with ""the guy who invented it,"" former Gov. and fellow Democrat Jim McGreevey, suggests the Star-Ledger's Paul Mulshine. McGreevey pitched it as a solution to the state's property-tax crisis and even got GOP support. It worked -- for one year; now the rebate program barely exists. Murphy, meanwhile, isn't even claiming that the money raised would go to direct property-tax relief. But ""if history is any indication, that's a big mistake.""

From the right: Ocasio-Cortez Believes Her Own Hype

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded with what Christine Rosen at Commentary calls ""childish Twitter sarcasm and victimology"" to last week's New York Post expos√© of her extensive use of Uber and Lyft and penchant for flying. But the question of her hypocrisy is legitimate, especially given her ""sanctimonious, hyper-personalized"" style of politics. Fact is, most of those more-time-efficient travel choices probably were ""perfectly reasonable."" But what she fails -- or refuses -- to comprehend is that ""this kind of individual, free-market calculation is precisely what the Green New Deal would eliminate in the name of stopping the environmental apocalypse.""

The Washington Post's Megan McArdle says she's been wondering about the math behind Uber and Lyft ever since people started telling her they're cheaper than owning a car. Ride-shares essentially are taxicabs -- ""better dispatched and more convenient, but, still, taxicabs."" And ""unless you are a hermit or live in a dense urban core, a month of taking cabs costs more than a month of Corolla ownership."" They're price-competitive outside of Manhattan only thanks to ""heavy subsidies, from both the companies and the drivers themselves."" That's why Lyft in 2018 lost more than $900 million; Uber, ""not quite as much."" They're selling ""a physical service that's pretty expensive to deliver,"" and ""at some point, we're going to have to pay"" what ""those rides are actually worth.""

Yet ""the most historically significant documents"" may pertain to the immediate postwar period, when the Vatican ""was consumed by fear"" of communism taking over Italy in the wake of Mussolini's downfall. Pius ""played a major behind-the-scenes role in these fateful years in turning Italians against the Communists,"" and we're now ""likely to learn how he went about it.""

"With zero apologies to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the chickens of the Democratic Party are coming home to roost.

Dems are now squawking mad over the overtly anti-Semitic comments of freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. With some fanfare, speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, citing charges Omar has raised repeatedly, including ""the myth of dual loyalty.""

Unfortunately, Omar's colleagues are not mad enough to name the very person whose conduct they are denouncing. Nor, as it turned out, did they have the votes even to do that. Their latest plan is to water the resolution down to mush by also condemning other forms of hate, including Islamophobia.

REP. ILHAN OMAR SHOULD BE CONDEMNED -- RELIGIOUS, RACIAL AND ETHNIC HATRED MUST FIND NO REFUGE IN CONGRESS

Their cowardice is not incidental to the problem. It is the problem.

Nor is it a coincidence that the Democratic Party is increasingly both the anti-Israel party and home to a growing number of anti-Semites. To be clear, the two things are not always the same, but something is going on when both are defining elements of a political organization.

One obvious truth is that Dems have failed to deal with anti-Semitism forthrightly, and now are confronted by a metastasizing cancer in their ranks.

Years ago, such as in 1984, when Jesse Jackson referred to New York as ""Hymietown,"" the outcry was slow at first but eventually unanimous. But Democrats are a different party today, in part because they moved sharply to the left under President Obama. He had both prominent Jewish backers and a 20-year relationship with Rev. Wright, whose sermons mixed anti-Semitism with anti-Americanism.

Another development was Obama's effort to lure Iran in from the pariah-state cold despite its vow to eliminate Israel. And as part of the party's increased focus on social justice and income inequality, it found itself making common cause with radical bedfellows, including Occupy Wall Street, anarchists and other fringe elements.

To this day, the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan, who has long embraced dehumanizing imagery and language about Jews, is nonetheless held in high regard by some Democrats, including a handful of top black elected officials. A 2005 picture of Obama with Farrakhan, taken at a Congressional Black Caucus event, only recently surfaced, with the photographer saying he was pressured to keep it secret to protect Obama from criticism.

Tellingly, the emergence of the photo did more to normalize Farrakhan than hurt Obama.

While some far-left groups incorporate anti-Semitism into their global conspiracy theories, others couch their criticism of Israel only in political terms. Yet they never hold despotic regimes, such as Iran, Russia or China, to the same standards they hold Israel, reflecting both their own implicit bigotry and much of the United Nations' as well.

Consider two groups, the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement and Students for Justice in Palestine, which sometimes overlap and have vocal representation on many college campuses, including in New York City.

The standard indoctrination equates Zionism with colonialism, and Jews with white oppressors. To be fair, these ideas are echoed in the national liberal media, including The New York Times, where Israel is blamed for everything wrong in the Middle East and where demands are made on Jews to make major concessions for peace while excuses are made for the fact that many Muslims refuse even to recognize Israel's right to exist.

Is it any surprise that there is a rise of anti-Semitic incidents in America and in New York, where such incidents make up more than half of the hate crimes reported?

The various threads of Jew-hatred, ancient and modern, discreet and naked, meet in the person of Linda Sarsour, a BDS supporter who helped found the Women's March, part of the resistance movement against President Trump. Sarsour, a Palestinian-American, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements and she and other leaders of the movement stand accused of discriminating against Jewish women.

Sarsour, who supported Bernie Sanders in 2016, is also a big supporter of Mayor de Blasio and received city grants for her Arab American Association, including $500,000 in 2016 alone.

Naturally, Sarsour defended Rep. Omar, and Tuesday she denounced Pelosi for even trying to condemn her anti-Semitism. ""Nancy is a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the dirty work of powerful white men,"" Sarsour wrote on Facebook. ""God forbid the men are upset.""

Ah yes, race, gender, religion -- they wouldn't be Democrats if identity politics weren't driving the bus.

None of this is to suggest there are no anti-Semites on the right. There clearly are, including those in white-supremacist groups, such as appeared in the infamous 2017 rally at Charlottesville, Va.

At least some are members of the Republican Party.

But there is a major difference as it relates to Israel and Judaism: The evangelical Christian movement is almost exclusively Republican, and it is a fervent supporter of Israel growing out of biblical history and because Israel allows access to Christian holy sites in Jerusalem that were mostly closed under Arab rule.

As a result, any Republican who does not support Israel likely would be shunned by the evangelical movement, which in some states constitutes the largest single bloc of GOP voters.

As Democrats tear themselves apart over what to do about Omar, if anything, they must first realize they have no one to blame but themselves.

"Some media women cry foul as male critics find fault with Captain Marvel.

Social media have been buzzing this week with anger and anguish about the gender breakdown of critics of the new movie Captain Marvel. Most are men. There is an excellent reason for this: Most movie critics are men. And there is an excellent reason for that: Men are much more willing publicly to express opinions than women. There is a natural experiment on the matter, which is the letters pages of newspapers. Anyone can write a letter to the editor; there are no barriers to entry. The vast majority of those who do so are male.

""All the negative reviews for #CaptainMarvel are from men,"" declared a tweet by the feminerd site The Mary Sue. This assertion can easily be disproven, and it immediately was, as helpful readers appended to that ridiculous claim excerpts from negative notices by Stephanie Zacharek of Time, Mara Reinstein from Us, Kristin Lopez of Culturess, Lindsey Bahr of the Associated Press, Laura Clifford of Reeling Reviews, etc. The story linked by the tweet hedges a bit with the headline, ""Captain Marvel Is Fun and Most the [sic] Negative Reviews Are Written by Men ... Shocking"" before going on to state, in the body of the story, ""It is telling that every negative review of the movie was written by a man."" A bit of a waffler, this Mary Sue person. Somewhat of a flibbertigibbet.

Another popular tweet continued with the androgen-shaming:

Writer Alyssa Klein posted links to 17 reviews written by men for major publications, complaining along the way that ""a few of these hardly even mention the words 'woman' and 'women.'"" This is the kind of person who sees Batman and wants to know why so many writers fail to point out that the title character is a man in a bat costume. Klein, who describes herself as a film journalist in her bio, pleads, ""If you're a publication or editor reading this thread, I'll hope you'll challenge yourself to commission women to write your #CaptainMarvel reviews."" I wonder if there is any female writer in particular she would like to see given more commissions?

The New York Times (the first of the publications to incur Klein's damnation for assigning a man to review Captain Marvel) has two lead film critics, one a man and one a woman. The Times does not appear to have a policy of assigning female-centric films to Manohla Dargis and male-centric films to A. O. Scott, because that would be stupid. Critics review all sorts of material by and about people who don't necessarily match their demographics. Quality is quality. Critics can, or at least should, be able to recognize it, regardless of whether they have a Y chromosome.

Where does Klein's logic lead? Should culture be a Victorian dinner party at which the men and women separate, the men smoking cigars and talking politics while the ladies settle in a separate area to discuss lady issues? If a man's opinion holds no value in women's spheres of influence, maybe women should butt out when the discussion turns to sectors led by men? When it comes to capitalism, maybe all the female social workers and schoolteachers should zip their lips while the male stockbrokers and hedge-fund managers decide matters?

That wouldn't be very democratic, but the world of blockbuster filmmaking is necessarily centered on the demos. Certain of the people involved in making such films seem not to understand the point. One of these is Brie Larson, the star of Captain Marvel. Last year Larson opined, ""I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn't work for him about Wrinkle in Time. It wasn't made for him. I want to know what it meant to women of color, to biracial women, to teen women of color, to teens that are biracial."" A Wrinkle in Time cost well over $100 million to make and distribute. I doubt that the Walt Disney Company expected to turn a profit by selling tickets exclusively to biracial teen girls, any more than MGM's marketing plan for The Wizard of Oz involved attracting only teen girls, scarecrows, talking lions, and metallic woodcutters.

Should A Wrinkle in Time be afforded a critical safe space in which only those deemed most demographically likely to praise the film would be invited to write about it? To me that sounds closer to publicity than criticism. Should Captain Marvel be reviewed only by women, or should only reviews by women be credited? Perhaps a distaff Rotten Tomatoes will spring up to shield delicate feminist readers from the views of any nasty boys out there and to provide female film critics a walled garden free of competition from the world's males. That sounds awfully overprotective and patronizing. It certainly doesn't sound like the view of someone who thinks women are as able as men when it comes to reviewing a film. It's a bit like offering female military recruits twice as much time to complete the two-mile run. For a movie built around the concept of a super-woman who kicks butt more vigorously than any man and asks for no special favors from anybody, that would appear to be an ironic position.",535,nationalreview.com,Do Female Film Critics Need a Safe Space?
"""Jexodus is a totally genuine grassroots movement started by young millennials who are just trying to galvanize young Jews across the country and get them involved in what's happening in politics,"" said Pipko, ""seeing what's going on in both parties, and also getting them involved in voting in 2020.""

""And most importantly, creating an environment where young Jews can feel unafraid, stand up for themselves and their beliefs, and feel free to come to their own conclusions about what's going on and decide who they want to vote for and how they want to be involved, and not let the media and the narrative decide that for them,"" added Pipko.

Jexodus describes itself on its website:

We are proud Jewish Millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics. We reject the hypocrisy, anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism of the rising far-left. Progressives, Democrats, and far too many old-school Jewish organizations take our support for granted. After all, we're Jewish, and Jews vote for Democrats.

Until today.

We are determined and we are unafraid to speak for ourselves. As combatants and veterans of the campus wars, we know the threat progressivism poses to Jews. We've had front row seats witnessing anti-Semites hide behind the thin veil of anti-Zionism. We know the BDS movement harbors deep hatred not only for Israel, but for Jews. We're done standing with supposed Jewish leaders and allegedly supportive Democrats who rationalize, mainstream, and promote our enemies. We'd rather spend forty years wandering in the desert than belong to a party that welcomes Jew-haters.

Pollak invited Pipko's comment on House Democrats' postponement of a proposed resolution opposing antisemitism.

""I think even the vote was a small effort in pretending that they cared [about antisemitism],"" assessed Pipko. ""There has been such an outrage in the media and among Republicans in Congress, and everyone that surrounds them, but I don't feel any strong effort. I actually feel it's getting worse since the Obama presidency, so I'm not really believing that it's going to happen or that it's going to change anything.""

Democrats cynically exploit fears of antisemitism to coerce Jews to support left-wing politics with false narratives, said Pipko.

""Democrats choose to use fear and scare people into believing that this is the right way to vote,"" stated Pipko. ""Even doing the research and finding out what President Trump stands for is too far, and they follow what everyone is doing before thinking for themselves. I think what's most important is to do the research and see what President Trump has done and has said, not only about the Jewish people, but about Israel and standing with Israel. If you actually look at what's been done versus what's been told to you that's been done, you'll actually change your mind.""

Jews on college and university campuses are pressured by left-wing groups to divorce Judaism and Zionism, explained Pipko.

""What's being to told to young people -- specifically millennials on college campuses -- is that to be proudly Jewish is for some reason be against Israel,"" Pipko remarked. ""I think there's huge pressure to conform to that, especially, like I said on college campuses. People are separating supporting Israel and being Jewish. People are trying to get people against what's going on in the Middle East, so we explain to them what's actually happening. They're trying to make young people believe that you can be proudly Jewish while standing against Israel. That's what I'm seeing on college campuses. That's what I'm seeing young people dealing with every single day. ""

Much of the push to separate Jews from supporting Israel ""starts with the Democratic Party,"" said Pipko.

Pipko noted the importance of entering ""the belly of the beast"" -- left-wing platforms such as MSNBC and evening TV comedy shows -- in order to successfully win over left-wing and Democrat-supporting Jews.

Pipko recalled criticisms directed at her from leftists and Democrats. ""I've been told that I'm not allowed to be this person and be a woman, I'm not allowed to be this person and be a Jew, I'm not allowed to be this person and be from New York, all these things,"" she said. ""The more I deal with that, I realize how many other people are dealing with the exact same thing, and that actually scared me, and encouraged me to reject it.""

Jexodus is planning ""big events in New York and Florida,"" said Pipko. ""We plan to go across the country in 2020. We'll be visiting Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Colorado, all the important states where 2020 really matters. We can be effective based on what we do.""

In January 2019, Pipko revealed she was a member of Trump's 2016 campaign staff but kept her support a secret to protect her modeling career -- as she had appeared in publications like Maxim and Sports Illustrated. ""My manager kept saying how evil the people who work for him must be and that he would never work with anyone who supported him,"" she told the New York Post. ""I was terrified they would find out that I was one of the so-called evil people.""

"Taylor Swift has been under intense pressure from her fangirl base of single young women to throw (what there is of) her weight into politics, but until recently Swift seemed to deem it wise to heed the record-industry equivalent of the dictum attributed to Michael Jordan: ""Republicans buy sneakers too."" Last fall, though, Swift broke with precedent and for the first time took an overtly political stance when she endorsed the candidacy of Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen in her native Tennessee, meanwhile denouncing Republican Marsha Blackburn as having a voting record that ""appalls and terrifies me"" and adding, ""These are not MY Tennessee values."" Bredesen sank as rapidly as Swift's latest album, Reputation, losing by double digits.

Today, an interview for Elle magazine, Swift hints that she is going to be very active in Democratic party politics in 2020. Without mentioning President Trump, she seems to refer to him as ""disgusting.""

She tells Elle, ""I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change."" Approaching 30, she says, she has only recently begun to feel comfortable speaking out on politics to her many social-media followers.

I'm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year."" Looks as though the alt-right is going to have to find another Aryan goddess to worship.

"She mounts her high horse to rail against 'dark money,' but those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.

In one of her many viral social-media moments, freshman Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio last month played a so-called ""corruption game,"" grilling witnesses at a House Oversight Committee hearing about the influence of super PACs and ""dark money."" By some measures, the video of her questioning became the ""most-viewed Twitter video of any politician,"" including President Trump.

For her, the optics were perfect. Here was an idealistic young socialist using clever cross-examination techniques to expose for all the world the way in which savvy political operators can conceal misdeeds and hide from the public the sources of their financial support. Her questions generated a rapturous response across the length and breadth of the progressive Internet.

Fast-forward one month. Here's Alana Goodman, writing for the Washington Examiner:

Two political action committees founded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's top aide funneled over $1 million in political donations into two of his own private companies, according to a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.

The cash transfers from the PACs -- overseen by Saikat Chakrabarti, the freshman socialist Democrat's chief of staff -- run counter to her pledges to increase transparency and reduce the influence of ""dark money"" in politics.

And here's the Washington Post, picking up on Alana's report:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)'s chief of staff helped establish two political action committees that paid a corporation he ran more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017, federal campaign finance records show.

You can read the FEC complaint yourself, but in a nutshell: It describes an arrangement where Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, co-founded two PACs -- Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress -- and then funneled large sums of money from those PACs into limited-liability companies he controlled, without disclosing Ocasio-Cortez's involvement and without disclosing how that money was ultimately disbursed. Further, the complaint claims that Ocasio-Cortez was a board member of Justice Democrats when it disbursed these funds.

In fact, as a comprehensive report by Andrew Kerr at the Daily Caller News Foundation notes, Ocasio-Cortez and Chakrabarti had legal control over the Justice Democrats PAC while it was supporting Ocasio-Cortez's campaign.

What's wrong with this? Well, apart from the obvious potential for financial self-dealing, Ocasio-Cortez's team may well have violated disclosure laws and contribution limits. Moreover, as we know from Michael Cohen's guilty plea and the ongoing campaign-finance investigation of President Trump, if evidence emerges that Ocasio-Cortez or Chakrabarti committed knowing or willful violations of campaign-finance law, then they could face criminal prosecution.

Interestingly, Justice Democrats last year posted a lengthy explanation for its unusual arrangement, outlining why it dumped PAC money into limited-liability companies. Crucially, it does not say that the PAC did so without engaging in any meaningful disclosure. Instead, it essentially argues that we should trust their good will, that they kept ""prices as low as possible"" while still satisfying FEC requirements.

In other words, the message is ""Trust us, please."" But a key purpose of campaign-finance disclosure laws is to remove trust in favor of mandated transparency.

At the very least, hypocrisy abounds. It is simply stunning that Ocasio-Cortez would mount such a very high moral horse and berate witnesses at a congressional hearing while this ""dark money"" skeleton lurks in her closet. The very best possible read on her actions is that she read ambiguities into the law to her maximum advantage. A more realistic view is that she and her campaign chair (and now chief of staff) creatively evaded the obvious intent of campaign-finance law and will now rely on FEC gridlock and her enormous reservoir of progressive good will to skate straight through this scandal.

America's byzantine campaign-finance regulations comprehensively and wrongly treat political speech as second-class speech, regulating it to a level that would likely shock the Founders. But these statutes and regulations are still binding. They're binding on Donald Trump, and they're binding on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Moreover, PAC disclosure rules and contribution limits are not obscure elements of campaign-finance law. As Ocasio-Cortez herself demonstrated at length in her viral moment last month, they're a highly visible part of the ongoing public debate.

It will be an interesting irony if the FEC concludes that Ocasio-Cortez's unusual financial arrangements pass legal muster. The champion of transparency and the enemy of ""dark money"" would have pioneered a new way to enrich friends and allies and hide campaign activities from the public eye. But then again, why should we be surprised? If there's one thing we've learned from the long and sordid history of world socialism, it's that the leaders of the movement always find a way to do very well while they purport to work for the public good.",538,nationalreview.com,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Monumental Hypocrisy | National Review
"Chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Saikat Chakrabarti, is under growing scrutiny for funneling more than $1 million in campaign donations to corporations he owned in 2016 and 2017.

First reported by conservative news outlets, the Washington Post followed up with report Tuesday that said that the arrangement was a ""sharp juxtaposition"" with Ocasio-Cortez's calls for transparency in politics, noting that the congresswoman has called dark money ""the enemy to democracy.""

""The money that flowed to her chief of staff's corporation have subjected the first-term congresswoman to critics' charges of hypocrisy,"" reported the Post's Michelle Ye Hee Lee.

""In a normal situation, if all you saw was a PAC that disbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars to an affiliated entity to pay the salaries of people who were really working for the PAC, that looks [like] a PAC that takes in money to engage in political activity but is actually enriching its owners,"" Adav Noti, a former Federal Election Commission lawyer who is now chief of staff of the Campaign Legal Center, told the Post.

The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) filed a complaint Monday with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that the scheme violated campaign finance reporting requirements.

According to the complaint, Chakrabarti established two PACs, the Brand New Congress PAC and Justice Democrats PAC, then systematically transferred more than $885,000 in campaign contributions received by the PACs to corporations he established -- Brand New Campaign LLC and Brand New Congress in 2016 and 2017.

Corporations, unlike PACs and candidate campaigns, are exempt from reporting or itemizing all of their significant expenditures, and leave hidden who benefitted from the money.

""These are not minor or technical violations. We are talking about real money here,"" Tom Anderson, director of NLPC's Government Integrity Project, said in a statement. ""In all my years of studying FEC reports, I've never seen a more ambitious operation to circumvent reporting requirements.""

David Mitrani, a lawyer for the Ocasio-Cortez campaign, the PACS, and the LLCs, said the PACs did not disclose information about the ultimate recipients of the money because they were not required to do so by the FEC, according a statement.

""If the PACs and campaigns were required to provide additional information on subvendor payments made by Brand New Congress LLC, it would have done so,"" he wrote.

He provided a 2017 contract between the Justice Democrats PAC and the Brand New Congress LLC, that showed the PAC paying the LLC a monthly retainer fee of $60,000. According to the contract, the fee was to pay employees, subcontractors, and agents.

The contract shows the primary consultants for the project were Chakrabarti, the LLC's then-chief operating officer Nasim Thompson, and Corbin Trent, a consultant who is now a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez.

Mitrani has denied that Chakrabarti ever received any ""salary or profit"" from his corporation, the PACs, or the campaign.

The Coolidge Reagan Foundation has also filed another FEC complaint alleging that Brand New Congress PAC was involved in a scheme to funnel money to Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, Riley Roberts, according to the Washington Times.

Ocasio-Cortez's campaign in 2017 also paid Chakrabarti's corporation, Brand New Congress, LLC, $18,880 for ""strategic consulting.""

At the same time her campaign was paying the Brand New Congress PAC for strategic consulting, the PAC was paying Roberts, for a total of $6,000, for being a ""marketing consultant.""

Ocasio-Cortez denied that her campaign ever paid her boyfriend, or that he was on her payroll. ""They were not working for me and they are two separate entities here,"" she told the Washington Times. ""This is the difference between an LLC and a PAC.""

The Coolidge Reagan Foundation said in their complaint that it looked like a shell game.

""The timing and amounts of these transactions, the use of two affiliated entities as intermediaries, the vague and amorphous nature of the services Riley ostensibly provided, the magnitude of these transactions compared to both the limited funds the campaign had raised at the time and the total amount of its expenditures, and the romantic relationship between Ocasio-Cortez and Riley collectively establish reason to believe these transactions may have violated campaign finance law,"" it said.",539,Breitbart,Ocasio-Cortez Chief of Staff's Campaign Finance Controversy Grows
"What a fascinating story in The Atlantic: scientists have established a connection between one's political views and one's innate physical sensitivity to disgust. Excerpts:

As Montague mapped the neuroimaging data against ideology, he recalls, ""my jaw dropped."" The brains of liberals and conservatives reacted in wildly different ways to repulsive pictures: Both groups reacted, but different brain networks were stimulated. Just by looking at the subjects' neural responses, in fact, Montague could predict with more than 95 percent accuracy whether they were liberal or conservative.

The subjects in the trial were also shown violent imagery (men pointing revolvers directly at the camera, battle scenes, car wrecks) and pleasant pictures (smiling babies, beautiful sunsets, cute bunnies). But it was only the reaction to repulsive things that correlated with ideology. ""I was completely flabbergasted by the predictability of the results,"" Montague says.

His collaborators -- John Hibbing and Kevin Smith at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and John Alford at Rice University, in Houston -- were just as surprised, though less by the broad conclusion than by the specificity of the findings and the startling degree of predictability. Their own earlier research had already yielded a suggestive finding, indicating that conservatives tend to have more pronounced bodily responses than liberals when shown stomach-churning imagery. However, the investigators had expected that brain reactions to violent imagery would also be predictive of ideology. Compared with liberals, they'd previously found, conservatives generally pay more attention -- and react more strongly -- to a broad array of threats. For example, they have a more pronounced startle response to loud noises, and they gaze longer at photos of people displaying angry expressions. And yet even in this research, Hibbing says, ""we almost always get clearer results with stimuli that are disgusting than with those that suggest a threat from humans, animals, or violent events. We have an ongoing discussion in our lab about whether this is because disgust is simply a more powerful and more politically relevant emotion or because it is an emotion that is easier to evoke with still images in a lab setting.""

The piece says that scientists don't have a good explanation for this, only theories, most of which have to do with the idea that it's an evolutionary adaptation to protect the group from unknown threats. It's interesting to consider this in light of social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations work, which shows that conservatives have a much wider palette from which to draw their political views, whereas liberals focus mostly on Care/Harm and Fairness/Cheating. More:

No doubt your own political allegiances will heavily influence what you extract from the bulk of this research. If you're liberal, you may be thinking, So this explains some of the other side's nativism and hostility to immigration. But it's just as easy to flip the science on its head and conclude, as conservatives might, that the left is composed of clueless na√Øfs whose rosy-eyed optimism about human nature -- and obliviousness to various dangers -- will only lead to trouble.

The research itself does not speak to the relative merits of a conservative or liberal ethos -- how could it? Conservatism and liberalism are not monolithic, and they rest on deep intellectual traditions. In terms of gut reactions, the relative appeal of each philosophy can depend significantly on context -- for instance, on whether times are kind or cruel. When tensions are high and groups split into factions, as they inevitably do, we can depend on our family and friends to defend our interests -- but the outsider is an unknown quantity and, from an evolutionary perspective, may be seen as a source of contamination or, more generally, a threat.

One defining characteristic of disgust, though, is that it occupies a blind spot in our psyche. As Pizarro notes, ""It's such a low-level, almost noncognitive emotion that you really aren't thinking that much about it."" Compared with anger, happiness, and sadness, he says, disgust is also ""less open to change based on your judgment, your thoughts, your reasoning."" Chocolate in the shape of dog poop, he points out, is still gross. The emotion is more reflexive than reflective. ""That is the rhetorical strength of disgust,"" Pizarro says. ""It's a little hack. You hack into brains pretty quickly and easily by making them feel disgust,"" bypassing logic and reason to sway judgment.

This could be why the tee-tee tweet from right-wing Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro is so controversial. Bolsonaro tweeted out a short clip of two perverts gallivanting on a balcony at Rio's Carnival, performing for the crowd below. One of them urinated on the other, who received the ""golden shower"" gratefully. Liberal opponents of Bolsonaro raised hell about his supposedly prudish tweet. Bolsonaro knows what he's doing, though. He trolled the Left into defending an act that most people understandably find revolting.

Here's something interesting. On Jonathan Haidt's test for moral foundations, I scored unusually high on the ""purity"" scale. It so happens that I am extremely sensitive to certain aromas that most people find disgusting (and even some that most people don't). It's so bad that there are times when I will have to leave the room quickly so as not to vomit (which means my wife is the one left behind to clean up the dog poop, and suchlike). It is entirely involuntary. Entirely. When I was a kid, I couldn't be nearby when the men gutted and skinned a deer they had killed. It wasn't the visual imagery; it was the smell. I would double over gagging, and couldn't help myself.

This is also why I can taste and smell pleasant nuances in food and drink, and enjoy eating more than most people. Two of my three kids are the same way -- except their sensitivities are ramped up so much that they don't like to eat things that taste vivid. All three of us can detect aromas that most people can't, and when we find them unpleasant, we also find them to be intolerable. Weirdly, my daughter cannot stand the aroma of bananas. It's so severe for her that we don't eat them in her presence. Just the sight and smell of a banana is enough to put her on the edge of vomiting.

Does this have anything to do with my conservative politics? Maybe -- but how would this theory account for the extreme sensitivity that so many left-wing college students have to the mere presence of conservatives in their midst?

The tweet was just the latest in a string of statements by Omar that have been slammed for being anti-Semitic. In 2012, she tweeted that ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine#Israel."" She did not apologize for posting the tweet until last January.

"One of the nation's top Latino political operatives has joined Joe Biden's camp, in a sign the former vice president is seriously considering running for the Oval Office in 2020, according to Politico.

Crist√≥bal Alex, an A-lister in Latino politics, on Tuesday announced he was leaving his position as president of the influential political organization Latino Victory, which he co-founded in 2014 with actress Eva Longoria and Henry Munoz, the finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Politico, which did not name its source, said that Alex's role in the Biden camp is unclear.

A native of El Paso, Texas, Alex himself has given few clues. But in several tweets, he offered a strong indication he would fight to defeat President Donald Trump's re-election effort. On Tuesday, he called Trump ""a clear and present danger to our nation,"" and added ""I am commited to doing everything in my power to defeat him, and my next steps will reflect that.""

Alex has tweeted praise for declared presidential candidates like fellow Texan Julian Castro, who headed the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration. He also has tweeted praise for former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, who appears close to announcing a presidential bid.

""It's been an incredible five years helping to build this effort, and I know that you will carry on our work to increase political power as we enter the most consequential election of our lifetime,"" Alex said in his goodbye notice to Latino Victory.

Alex was national deputy director of voter outreach and mobilization for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in the 2016 campaign.

A few days ago, Alex defended Biden on Twitter after the former vice president came under fire from the LGBT community for referring to Vice President Mike Pence - who has controversial views on LGBT issues - as ""a decent guy"" in a speech.

""For those attacking @JoeBiden today, it's worth remembering the VP took enormous heat for announcing his support for gay marriage on @MeetThePress long before others, as senator he blocked ultra-conservative Judge Bork & he's officiated gay marriages. He's always been an ally.""

Alex also retweeted Biden on the controversy.

Biden is expected to make an announcement in the near future on whether he'll run for president. The Hill reported Biden wants to secure enough funds before making the leap, and has been diligently reaching out to donors in recent days.

""It's a priority,"" the Hill quoted an unnamed source identified only as a Biden ally. ""If you don't have a good second quarter showing, that could be problematic.""

One of Biden's pitches for his case in a crowded field of Democrats is that during the midterms he was able to successfully campaign for candidates in both Democratic- and Republican-leaning states.

RELATED: DEMS FEAR NEVER-ENDING CLINTON-SANDERS FEUD COULD DAMAGE PARTY IN 2020

Biden leads most state and national polls of Democratic presidential primary candidates.

Alex would be an obvious guide to appealing to Latino voters, but those who know his political work say he is a force to be reckoned with on a broader scale.

Former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook was one of numerous influencers in politics who sang Alex praises after he announced his departure from Latino Victory. ""Cristobal stood out as a rising star on our campaign and is now among the leading senior talents in our party,"" Mook was quoted as saying in The Hill. ""Although his roots are in organizing the Latinx community, he distinguished himself over the last few years as a generalist and manager.""

Alex, a former civil rights lawyer, is credited with doubling the Victory Fund campaigning arm's fundraising to $4 million in 2018 from around $2 million in 2016. The Latino Victory website says that before entering the political worls, Alex spent more than five years in philanthropy, working at the Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation.",542,Fox News,"Biden camp hires top Latino operative in new sign of possible run, report says"

Ariane Tabatabai reviews the poor record of the Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaigns against North Korea and Iran:

Where the pressure campaign against North Korea was too minimalist, Iran sees the campaign against it as so maximalist that it is not inclined to negotiate. The campaign's scope is too broad, encompassing virtually all aspects of the regime's foreign and security policies, and its objectives virtually unattainable without regime change. It is also too indiscriminate. The sanctions regime is affecting many average Iranians, including medical patients, children, and students, who are unable to afford medication or pursue their studies outside their country. For now, the Iranians seem to have made the decision to wait out the Trump administration and not return to the negotiating table until they have more clarity on the trajectory of U.S. domestic politics in the next two years.

Both ""maximum pressure"" campaigns have failed in their stated aims because the administration has made demands that are excessive and touch on the other government's perceived core security concerns. In the Iranian case, ""maximum pressure"" was never going to bring their government back to the table after the U.S. unceremoniously reneged on its commitments under the existing nuclear deal. To resume negotiations with an administration that had just proven itself to be completely untrustworthy would be to invite political ruin at home for anyone that tried it. Faced with expansive and unrealistic demands that Iran essentially abandon its entire foreign policy and all of its nuclear program, no self-respecting Iranian government could do anything other than reject them. As for North Korea, the administration has labored under the false belief that sanctions pressure was responsible for getting Kim to talk when it was the completion of North Korea's own nuclear weapons and missile development that created the opening for negotiations. The Trump administration has been consistently wrong about the effectiveness of sanctions and the extent of concessions that the other side is prepared to make, and because they are so convinced that sanctions can be effective they are unwilling to offer any sanctions relief that might give the other government an incentive to compromise. Instead, the administration is responding to its failure at the Hanoi summit by threatening North Korea with more sanctions:

""If they're not willing to do it, then I think President Trump has been very clear ... they're not going to get relief from the crushing economic sanctions that have been imposed on them and we'll look at ramping those sanctions up in fact,"" said Bolton, a hardliner who has advocated a tough approach to North Korea in the past.

Sanctions frequently fail to change the behavior of a targeted regime, and they are almost guaranteed to fail when they are used to try to force radical changes to a regime's security policies. The more vitally important a regime believes these policies are to its survival and security, the less likely they are to compromise them because a foreign adversary threatens to punish them if they don't. It's a normal, predictable reaction to outside coercion, and it is exactly how we would respond if if we were in their position. When an adversary threatens punishment unless we agree to do what they want, the standard response is to do the opposite of what they demand. Sometimes this is the response just because they have demanded it of us. Because our policymakers can't or won't see things from the side of the governments whose behavior they are trying to change, they routinely opt for punitive measures that have failed again and again. The Trump administration remains wedded to a ""maximum pressure"" approach that doesn't and can't work in achieving their stated goals, and it isn't going to achieve the regime change that they obviously want to bring about in Iran.",543,The American Conservative,Why 'Maximum Pressure' Doesn't and Can't Work
"SEOUL -- Perhaps none of the communist legacies shared by Vietnam and North Korea highlighted during Kim Jong Un's ""goodwill visit"" to Hanoi is stranger than the embalmed leaders on display in their capital cities and the secretive team of Russian technicians that keeps the aging bodies looking ageless.

Kim laid a wreath outside Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum in the Vietnamese capital on Saturday, after the conclusion of his shortened summit with US President Donald Trump.

Inside the dark interior of the mausoleum, the embalmed corpse of Vietnam's founding father lies displayed in a glass coffin for a steady stream of tourists who silently shuffle by.

In Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un's grandfather and father are on similar display in the loftily named Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a monument to the cult of personality that surrounds North Korea's ruling family.

All three leaders were originally preserved by a team of specialists from the so-called ""Lenin Lab"" in Moscow, which first embalmed and displayed Vladimir Lenin's body in 1924.

The Soviet Union may have collapsed and socialism in both Vietnam and North Korea has taken on forms barely recognizable to the ideology's first thinkers, but that same lab still performs annual maintenance on Ho and according to at least one researcher, still helps North Korea keep the Kims looking fresh.

""The original embalming and the regular re-embalmings have always been conducted by the scientists of the Moscow lab,"" said Alexei Yurchak, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, who is writing a book about the embalmed communist leaders.

""Over the years they trained local scientists in some techniques, but not all, maintaining the core of the know-how secret.""

Body work

Unlike earlier preservation processes such as mummification, the permanent embalming pioneered by Soviet scientists kept the bodies flexible, with unblemished skin and a lifelike, if rather waxy, pallor.

With North Vietnam under regular attack by American warplanes at the time of Ho's death in 1969, the Soviet Union airlifted chemicals and equipment to a cave outside Hanoi, which the Soviet experts turned into a sterile lab, Yurchak said.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s, the government lab faced a funding crisis, leading it to rely more heavily on offering services to foreign clients, Yurchak said.

Among those customers was North Korea, where Russian specialists embalmed both Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il at a laboratory built into the mausoleum in Pyongyang.

The original embalming takes several months and the bodies need regular upkeep.

""Every one-and-a-half to two-years, these bodies are re-embalmed by the Moscow scientists,"" Yurchak said, citing interviews he conducted with lab scientists and his own field research.

The website for the committee that manages Ho's mausoleum says Russia started charging for the chemicals after the Soviet Union collapsed, prompting Hanoi to ask that the supplies be produced in Vietnam. Vietnam has also sent technicians to study in Russia and can now handle the operations of the mausoleum by itself, the website says.

A source with committee, however, confirmed the monument is closed every year for two months and that Russian technicians help with annual maintenance of the body.

When contacted by Reuters, the mausoleum lab in Moscow, which since 1992 has been known as the Center for Scientific Research and Teaching Methods in Biochemical Technologies, declined to comment on any aspect of its work.

The North Korean delegation at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.

Researcher Tom Fowdy, who founded a group promoting tourism and cultural engagements in North Korea, said he has seen the Kumsusan Palace closed for unexplained ""renovations"", but maintenance of the bodies is a mystery.

""While it is obvious the methodology was derived from Russia, it will be a closely kept secret,"" he said.

Some experts say China, which relied on its own scientists to embalmed Mao Zedong because of tension between Beijing and Moscow at the time, may have taught or helped North Korea.

Changing symbols

Visitors to Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace pass displays that include Kim Jong Il's personal yacht and an Apple computer the dictator had once owned, before being required to bow three times to the bodies.

""The personality politics of the Kims exceeds all others,"" Fowdy said, noting that maintaining the memorial will continue to ""receive overwhelming priority"" in North Korea's government budgeting.

It's not clear how much impoverished North Korea spends on maintaining the Kims' bodies. When Moscow released preservation costs for the first time in 2016, it reported spending nearly $200,000 that year to maintain Lenin.

Originally the embalming was seen as a way of joining the various countries to international communism, as embodied in Lenin.

But as Vietnam and North Korea developed in their different political ways, so has the meaning attached to preserving the leaders' bodies.

""Today this original meaning of these bodies has changed - in Vietnam the body of Ho today stands for anti-colonial struggles for independence and even for new nationalism, much more than for communism,"" Yurchak said. ""In North Korea the two Kims' bodies stand for a self-sufficient country organized around one leader and existing in the face of the 'imperialist surroundings.'""",544,New York Post,The Russian science keeping North Korea's dead leaders looking fresh
"Speaking on 'Fox &amp; Friends,' press secretary Sarah Sanders calls it 'absolutely outrageous' that Democrats are launching investigations into the president instead of solving the country's problems.

Democrats are again moving the goal posts - and America's attention - to a new round of investigations. The reason? They can't win on results.

Democrats' politically-motivated sideshow is an effort to distract from all of the good that is happening in our country right now: Our economy is booming, GDP is climbing, our labor market is strong, wages are rising, and job creators are once again optimistic.

From the day he was elected, President Trump has been focused on fighting for the American people. Meanwhile, Democrats have been singularly committed to fighting President Trump. They know there was no ""Russia collusion,"" so now these career politicians are redirecting their attacks to President Trump's successful record in business.

DAVID BOSSIE: ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRATS PRACTICE POLITICS OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION AGAINST PRESIDENT

The latest example is being led by House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. This week, he issued document requests to more than 80 people in the president's orbit, proving that the Democrats are now embarking on a shameful fishing expedition in search of a crime.

The Special Counsel and Congressional committees have already investigated these tiresome claims, and the Democrats' desperate attempts at tearing down President Trump are merely for the purposes of distracting from their non-existent agenda.

The only substantive proposal we've seen Democrats put forth is from their ultra-radical playbook - and the top of the socialist wish-list: The $93 trillion ""Green New Deal."" This socialist proposal isn't just radical environmentalism; it's a massive taxpayer boondoggle that would give government control over nearly every aspect of our lives.

Democrats are leaning on political tactics to build their phony narrative for impeachment proceedings, to distract from their socialist agenda, and to divert from President Trump's long list of accomplishments.

When Democrats aren't pushing far-left proposals, they're doing what they can to obstruct and resist President Trump every step of the way. Chairman Nadler's political stunt on Monday is case in point. It serves as their contingency plan in case findings from any of the other ongoing committee investigations don't meet their political goals.

These document requests are nothing more than attempts to distract from President Trump's record of results that he has steadily delivered for the American people.

Over the past two years, we have seen a stream of promises made and promises kept. Republicans have enacted historic tax cuts to put more money into the pockets of middle-class Americans, cut 22 regulations for every new one, and confirmed the president's judicial nominees at a record-breaking pace - including two Supreme Court justices.

Our nation is thriving thanks to the hard work and bold leadership of President Trump and his administration.

"In an interview with five influential establishment newspapers from across the continent on Tuesday, the veteran MEP and Brussels' Brexit coordinator gave his backing to the vision of a federal EU superstate unveiled by Emmanuel Macron earlier this week.

A ""centrist, pro-European reformist political force"" needs to take charge in Brussels following May's EU elections, Verhofstadt said, stating that the French president's call ""for the revival of Europe"" must be ""one of the key points of reference"" for politicians aligned to this cause.

""The union envisioned by [the French president] is a Europe that can stand on its own two feet, in a world of great powers in which EU nations would not be able to protect their own interests and way of life by themselves,"" he said.

Asserting that ""nothing is eternal"", the Belgian politician stressed that, without a statist Brussels takeover -- which would see Eurocrats create an EU army, seize control over national borders, migration and bloc-wide energy policy, and even ""organise the internet in a European way"" -- a populist ""nightmare will become reality"".

Such measures are ""not just about blocking populists or nationalists but [are] also about breaking the current status quo and stagnation"" that prevents EU officials from imposing top-down ""reforms"" on every member state, Verhofstadt admitted, dismissing belief that European federalism could be slowed, or that any aspect of national sovereignty could be restored as ""stuck in the past"", and ideas which were on par with those of his right-wing ""enemies"".

Asked why he believes populist sentiment has been strengthening across the bloc, the former Belgian prime minister blamed the internet, before going on to echo Macron in endorsing an EU-wide purging the internet of so-called ""hate"".

""One reason is technical, in that social media is being used for political and electoral abuse such as lies, hate speech and other manipulations about which Facebook, for example, has done very little.""

""A second reason"" for the growth of patriotic politics in Europe, according to Verhofstadt, was a ""lack of courage"" in Brussels to sanction, penalise, and shut down popular conservatives leaders such as Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb√°n.

The 65-year-old, who has led EU Parliament's Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) for a decade, called for the creation of ""a single Euro-African economic area"" at a conference of the EU parliamentary grouping last week, claiming such a construct would have an ""enormous potential ... able to rival with China"" in terms of consumer numbers.",546,Breitbart,EU Elections 'Last Chance to End Nationalist Nightmare' - Verhofstadt
"Is Congress going too far? Reaction and analysis from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and 'Justice' host Jeanine Pirro.

Democrats in the U.S. House aren't going to let the facts get in the way of their impeachment witch hunt against President Trump.

It's clear that Democratic leaders have been misleading the American people for months by assuring them that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report will be the determining factor as they consider any impeachment inquiry.

Now - with the Russia collusion narrative thoroughly debunked - the Democrats are in full panic mode and making desperate mistakes on the investigative front.

DISHONEST DEMOCRATS WON'T WORK WITH TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH OF RADICAL LEFTISTS

Since November 2016, the left has spun the lie that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to win the election and that as a result President Trump is an illegitimate president. Democrats pushed this political opposition research pipe dream so hard that they turned their liberal base into an unhinged mob of Trump-hating lunatics.

All of this hatred and division was created by Hillary Clinton and her ilk; they couldn't face the reality that she lost to President Trump simply because he was a better candidate with better ideas.

Trump Derangement Syndrome has ravaged the Democratic Party to such an extent that Democrats never considered a post-Russia world in which their collusion narrative would fall flat on its face and the president would be cleared of any wrongdoing.

Now it's starting to sink in with the public that this long national ordeal of baseless investigations of the president has just been a big ruse and that the only campaign that really colluded with the Russians was Hillary Clinton's.

After two years of negative news coverage by the liberal media, this week's headline ""President Trump's approval rating continues to climb"" in USA Today must have gotten the attention of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., both leaders of the anti-Trump resistance.

Democrats are unable to come to grips with the fact that polling indicates only 18 percent of the American people have a ""positive view of socialism"" and that the Democratic Green New Deal is an unmitigated disaster for hardworking taxpayers.

So Democratic leaders in the House have nothing to turn to except the hyper-partisan ""subpoena cannon.""

The Democrats can't wait for the release of the highly anticipated final report by Special Counsel Mueller. Instead, Chairman Nadler made the political calculation this week to commence with liberal billionaire donor Tom Steyer's misguided dream of textbook investigative overreach by sending 81 inquiries to Trump-related associates and entities.

Make no mistake; the politics of personal destruction has begun and the American people are paying close attention to who's behind this shameful effort.

Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are acting and sounding more and more like the disgraced late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., every day.

McCarthy was censured by the Senate in 1954 after mounting aggressive investigations of what he claimed was communist infiltration of the federal government, in which many innocent people were smeared by false accusations.

Before interviewing a single witness, Nadler told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Sunday that he already believes that President Trump obstructed justice.

And Schiff appears poised to ignore the American people and Mueller's investigative findings by rehashing the entire Clinton-funded Russia hoax. He's hired former MSNBC contributor and prosecutor Daniel Goldman to aid his overreaching investigation.

Unsurprisingly, Goldman has already reached his investigative conclusions as well, stating on ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC recently that ""we already now know that the president has committed a felony in order to obtain the office of the presidency.""

This is McCarthyism 101 - determine guilt first, ask questions later.

Not to be outdone by all this poor judgment, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., is preparing to request 10 years of President Trump's tax returns for no reason other than to try to embarrass the president politically.

When former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., asked ""is there anybody in Washington who believes it will not be leaked,"" he hit the nail on the head. If the Ways and Means Committee ends up receiving the president's tax returns and they get leaked to the press, the partisan hacks responsible must be held accountable.

In the fast-approaching post-Mueller world of no Russian collusion, President Trump will have a big upper hand dealing with these bloviating liberal swamp creatures in the U.S. House.

"Shutting the door on mass migration is not an option in the 21st century, German parliament president Wolfgang Sch√§uble has said, urging Brussels to speed up plans for an EU army in order to kill nationalism.

In an interview with local media on Monday, Germany's parliament chief said he wanted progress towards a joint European armed forces to advance ""much faster"", and admitted to feeling ""impatient"" on the issue.

""We must explain, convincingly, that our defences are better together, then there will be no more room for the nationalists or demagogues,"" he said, adding he believes the project has the support of 'the majority of citizens in almost all EU countries', reports the Westf√§lische Rundschau.

Asked why he thought that ""demagogues"" might be gaining popularity in Europe, Sch√§uble admitted mass migration was ""such an issue"", but then stressed that ""nothing is made better by closing the borders and acting only for ourselves"".

""If you talk sensibly with people then they too understand, in the 21st century, that closing borders is no answer,"" said the Bundestag president, who -- as finance minister in 2016 -- claimed Germany's population would ""degenerate"" through inbreeding, without massive, ""enriching"" migration waves of Muslims from third world countries.

""Security within national borders is not something that exists -- especially when the world remains an uncomfortable place and because we are doing so well. Europe can find good answers,"" he told the regional newspaper.

The 76-year-old, whose political career in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union Party (CDU) has spanned more than four decades, also touched on the topics of Brexit and France in the interview.

He expressed the belief that Britain will ""either not leave the EU at all"" or else it would rejoin the bloc at a later date, emphasising the UK ""has always"" been more detached from Brussels politics while ""the core of European unification has always been Germany and France"".

Asked about the Yellow Vest protests,which have seen almost 10,000 people arrested so far during 16 straight weekends of action against France's globalist, Europhile government -- Sch√§uble downplayed the level of anger in the country at its president Emmanuel Macron, commenting: ""Those who bring reforms are always going to provoke some debate.""

""Political life in France can cope with the resistance,"" he said, adding that he has ""great respect for the determination with which President Macron is sticking to his course"".

Many of Sch√§uble's sentiments were echoed by his French ally on Monday, when Macron set out his ambitions for a federal EU superstate in an open letter addressed directly to ""the citizens of Europe"".

In addition to blasting nationalism and Brexit, the French leader also called for further powers to be transferred away from member states and handed to Brussels, including the removal of national sovereignty regarding the protection of external European borders -- a demand which Hungarian premier Viktor Orb√°n has warned is a desperate attempt by Eurocrats to thwart the successful frontier protection policies of patriotic eastern and central EU nations and force mass migration on the entire bloc.",548,Breitbart,No Place in 21st Century for Closing Borders - German Bundestag Prez
"The endless controversies generated by the president's mouth come in a half-dozen different varieties.

Few things are less surprising or more exhausting in this third year of Donald Trump's presidency than the almost-daily need to ask: ""Can you believe Trump said that?""

Yes, we believe it. We've been watching the same thing, just about every day, since Trump descended that escalator in June 2015. It shouldn't surprise anyone anymore. We know how frequently he exaggerates, lashes out at critics, repeats unfounded rumors, brags, and so on.

Yes, what a president says should ideally be accurate, temperate, and wise. Yes, a lot of what Trump says -- particularly when speaking off-the-cuff -- is false, inflammatory, and crude. No, he's not going to change. He is who he is, and he's never going to be shamed or pressured into behaving or thinking differently. Freaking out over everything that comes out of his mouth seems like a waste of time and energy at this point. But cataloging the types of things he says is a useful exercise, insofar as it helps clarify why he says them. It's easy enough to do, too, since there are about six different types:

1. I am the greatest.

As he said at CPAC, his improvisations are better than most other politicians' scripted remarks: ""You know I'm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script."" In his mind, even his critics secretly like him, and they only criticize him because they're ordered to do so by powerful, shadowy authorities: ""I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, 'What are you doing?'""

2. That good thing that happened was because of me.

Everything good that's happening in America -- the growing economy, pay raises for the military, the lack of nuclear war with North Korea, Ted Cruz's victory in Texas, low oil prices, the success of the U.S. bid for the 2026 World Cup, GOP gains in the Senate, declining drug prices -- is because of him, and mostly because of him.

3. It's not my fault.

""Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,"" he says with childlike amazement. The recent North Korean summit didn't work out because of the Michael Cohen hearing: ""For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to 'the walk'"" If it weren't for ""the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judge's, Military, Vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75 percent rather than the 50 percent just reported by Rasmussen. It's called Presidential Harassment!""

4. Trust me, my critics are terrible people.

""Trump lashes out at critics"" isn't really news anymore, because Trump lashes out at his critics like other people breathe: reflexively, constantly, unthinkingly.

Back during the 2016 campaign, Trump mused darkly about Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster. ""I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder,"" he said. After he won, he infamously leveled another completely unsupported charge: ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!""

In the years since, he's found plenty of targets for the same tactic. He has accused Adam Schiff of ""illegally leaking to Fake News CNN"" and warned that, ""The Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief."" He has called critics of his Syria policy ""failed generals."" He has dismissed his former staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman as a ""crazed, crying lowlife."" And he's called Cohen, his former lawyer, a ""weak person and not a very smart person.""

5. Here is a version of history that just I made up in my head.

This is perhaps the conversational realm in which Trump is most unpredictable and creative; on the fly, he can offer an alternate history worthy of Harry Turtledove.

""Didn't you guys burn down the White House?"" he asked Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. (That was the British, in 1812.)

Then there's his assertion that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was defensive: ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there. The problem is it was a tough fight. And literally, they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again, as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, a lot of these places you're reading about now are no longer a part of Russia because of Afghanistan.""

And of course there's his tendency to ascribe sentiments that gibe suspiciously with his own to his (real or imagined) interlocutors. Who can forget his claim that President Obama ""told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea,"" during their post-election meeting at the White House? How about the moment in the border-wall fight in which he claimed that, ""This should have been done by all of the Presidents that preceded me. And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it,"" even though all four living ex-presidents denied saying any such thing?

6. Look at that woman's appearance! How can you trust someone so unattractive?

""Look at that face. Would anybody vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?""

(To be fair, Trump's assessment of the women around him isn't always negative; during an intelligence briefing, he wondered why the ""pretty Korean lady"" wasn't negotiating with North Korea on his administration's behalf.)

Trump's lack of impulse control hinders him, his administration, and his party. But it's not going anywhere, and neither is he, at least not until next year, when the country decides whether the practical particulars of his governance outweigh the grief and aggravation caused by his runaway mouth.",549,nationalreview.com,The Six Types of Trump Statements | National Review
"The swamp is hungry, she explained in an interview with Breitbart News, pointing to a ""staff infection"" in Washington from Republican campaigns who never left town -- even when they lost elections.

""It's like that plant in The Little Shop of Horrors,"" she said, referencing a fictional man-eating plant to describe the climate of the swamp. ""Folks are unwittingly standing by one moment and gobbled up by it the next.""

Despite her long professional relationship with the president, there are no reports of Special Counsel Robert Mueller calling her in to testify. There appears to be little to no interest among Democrats for her testimony -- no interest in hearing from Trump's campaign manager at hearings about alleged collusion between the campaign and Russia. She does not even appear on the list released Monday of the 81 Trump-connected Americans that Democrats are investigating.

Maybe it's because she's not important enough to know anything significant, as her detractors suggest on background, or maybe it's because she knows enough about Washington to navigate the swamp.

I spoke with Conway after Trump's once braggadocious personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who once vowed to take a bullet for the president, spent the day berating his former boss on camera.

""This behavior is churlish, it denigrates the office of the president, and it's simply un-American,"" Cohen said to the cameras. ""And it's not you.""

It's been a long day in Washington as it began with the president meeting Kim Jong-un for nuclear negotiations and ended with the Michael Cohen show.

When I arrived for the interview, Conway had the wall-to-wall cable news coverage of the hearing playing in the background in her West Wing office.

She paused to listen to Democrat Chairman of the Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings and Republican Jim Jordan wrap up their closing statements before sitting down to talk about her role in the White House.

Conway has known the president almost as long as Cohen, as they both served on the board of Trump World Tower in New York. Cohen was the treasurer of the board, as his legal advice earned him points with the boss. Conway worked with Trump in a similar fashion -- joining the board after her husband George impressed him (George Conway now spends his days on Twitter criticizing the president -- much to the delight of the leftist ""Resistance"").

Cohen self-imploded after the election. Despite his pledged loyalty, he failed to get a job in the White House, he missed his chance to use his connections to the president to cash in, and now he's going to jail for other business failures -- despite his attempt to avoid prison by betraying the president.

Now he is desperate to please a different boss -- the newly empowered House Democrats, the Resistance, and the establishment media.

For hours, Cohen fulfilled every media and Democrat fantasy by describing the president as a racist, a con-man, a cheat, and a liar.

The president and most of his staff, however, were in a much different time zone -- twelve hours ahead in Vietnam for the summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Cohen was running the show on cable.

The Republican National Committee launched a rapid response effort, and the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump spent the day ripping him on Twitter. But Conway was the only senior staffer left in the West Wing to go on television to defend the president.

Conway is used to the slings and arrows from the left and the media, but a growing number of former administration officials in Washington, sources ""close to Trump"" or sources ""familiar with the family's thinking,"" express doubts about her loyalty or usefulness to the administration.

These sources are often hesitant to go on the record, not exactly eager to risk vengeance from someone close to the president.

The complaints are varied. She's not in charge of communications, but she communicates. She's not in charge of policy, but she's political. She's not in charge of staff, but she is keenly aware of what the staff is doing. She is kind and works to earn your trust, but some question if you can trust her.

Former Special Assistant to the president, Cliff Sims, took a direct shot at Conway in his tell-all book published in January. In one chapter, Sims revealed he witnessed Conway leaking to reporters in real time via text message.

In my conversation with Conway, she did not deny talking to reporters behind the scenes, explaining it as one of the strengths that she brought to the administration.

""It's a tough balance,"" she explained. ""I try to lend support to what press and comms are doing while respecting that they take the lead on those matters.""

Many Trump supporters might prefer that the administration entirely ignore the ""fake news"" media, but Conway argues that the president is the one that wants her to communicate with them.

""It's part of my job to provide information to the press, yet I don't speak to them as much as the president might like or as much as they would like,"" she said. ""Fortunately, the president communicates directly with the American people through his various platforms.""

But is Conway a professional communicator or one of the ""leakers"" described by the president?

She had a lot to say to the leakers, many of whom have left the building, but she claimed it was easy to identify the sources.

""They act like we don't know and that we don't see,"" she said. ""The West Wing is a very small place.""

Leakers fall into three categories, according to Conway.

First, she says that leakers attempt to misdirect attention from themselves by calling other people leakers. Second, they're rarely comfortable speaking publicly with the press. Third, she says that leakers believe it helps cover their tracks if they constantly berate the ""fake news"" in front of their colleagues.

But the ultimate tell, according to Conway, is any sudden drop of negative press attention directed their way.

Conway suggested she could blow up the entire Washington information game -- but warns that it might put some reporters in an uncomfortable spot.

""I've often told reporters that if I reveal the true leakers that have been in this administration, I'd be forced to reveal the 'leakees,' too,"" she says, referring to the reporters who receive the leaks. ""That normally compels them to shift topics to the weather.""

After his book was published in January, Cliff Sims appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe to promote it. Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the once prominent prom king and queen of the swamp, were delighted with the latest gossip about Conway.

During the interview, Sims details his own challenge for her.

""All she has to do is tell every reporter in Washington, DC, she can publicly say, 'if I've ever trashed the president off the record to you, I release you from the off-the-record binds,'"" he said.

""That would be a very very long line of reporters,"" Scarborough smirked.

But Conway has little interest in responding to ""Joe and Mika"" or Sims, who the president berated on Twitter after his appearance on their show.

""Working women spend so much of their careers amassing power. Information is power,"" she said. ""Why surrender it so freely?""

Despite the chaos, the leaking, and the bitterness of the first 500 days described in the Sims book, Conway appears unaffected by the latest round of criticism.

She remains among the few high-ranking former campaign officials still in the West Wing, which includes Steve Miller, social media director Dan Scavino, and, of course, the family -- Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

Oddly enough, former Governor Chris Christie released his own tell-all book on the same day as Sims. He has nothing but praise for Conway.

""She knew how to speak to Donald Trump,"" Christie wrote, recalling her work on the campaign. ""She could get a point across without being caustic but was still frank and direct.""

Conway steered away from any questions about her accomplishments in the campaign or the West Wing, carefully redirecting all credit to the president.

She said she was puzzled why some served in the administration despite professing misery in their high-ranking positions.

""The moment that you see it as more of a burden than a blessing, you should seriously consider moving on, because the president is right, many people would love to have these jobs,"" she said.

The list is long.

Top aides such as Mike Flynn, Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn, John Kelly, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Joe Hagin, and H.R. McMaster were either forced out, quit out of frustration, sold out, or were fired. And don't forget Anthony Scaramucci, who flamed out after a crass phone call with a reporter.

How is it that Conway has survived so long?

""I've been around my share of emotional and egotistical men, so maybe I'm an accidental expert on them,"" Conway said, referring to her career. ""Surviving them is easy; thriving in this environment is the true reward.""

She offered some insight about working for Trump, dismissing many of the tropes developed by the media.

""He easily detects and deflects nonsense,"" she says.

Success on the Trump team is not about the kamikaze loyalty displayed by so many former Trump officials, she explained. And it's not about being the most frequent or last person in the room on every issue. Despite what you might have heard, non-stop flattery of the president does not save you from exile. She claims that Trump is not convinced by people ""puffing themselves out to impress him"" in person or on TV.

""When I appear on TV, my primary audience is neither the president nor the press,"" Conway said. ""It is the people.""

For Conway, it appears, success lies in knowing your strengths in the administration and using them wisely.

Trump's loyal supporters treat her like a celebrity, despite public mockery from the Washington political class.

As she walked through the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last weekend, fans flocked to watch her participate in an interview before turning with a smile to greet them and snap some selfies.

Conway earned celebrity status in the world of Trump supporters, as she frequently appears on television to defend the president, despite public derision from the anchors who keep inviting her back. Her panel appearance at CPAC, however, focused on promoting the dangers of the opioid crisis and crediting the president for his unprecedented attempt to address it.

""The president acknowledges and appreciates those of us who are here for the right reasons,"" Conway explained. ""He prefers the company of people who are happy warriors like him.""

Conway said she did not consider herself a swamp creature, despite years of working in politics and media in Washington, DC. A swamp creature, she argues, is someone that leverages their power and influence for easy money and political status.

She reminds critics that she had a chance at post-election riches after her role in the biggest electoral upset in modern political history but chose to serve the president instead, at his request. That decision landed her in the center of the swamp for the foreseeable future, but she appears comfortable.

""There's a huge difference between studying and understanding the swamp and diving into the quicksand of the swamp,"" she explains.",550,Breitbart,Exclusive: Kellyanne Conway on the Leaks in Washington and the Dangers of the Swamp  | Breitbart
"Two Indian jets are shot down over Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, increasing tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals over the militarized region. Rep. Waltz explains what it means for the region and world.

Pakistan fears two things more than war with India: pressure from Washington and indifference from Beijing. In the latest round of tit-for-tat fighting with India, Pakistan saw a bit of both - more evidence that the country may be heading for the strategic dead-end of South Asia geo-politics. That's not the best outcome for Pakistan or the United States.

Islamabad and New Delhi have been rivals since the partition of India created Pakistan in 1947. Their enmity wasn't dampened when both sides got nuclear weapons in the 1980s.

But some things have changed. Today India sees Pakistan in its rearview mirror. India is focused on its role as an Indo-Pacific power and a rising global economic player.

WILL TRUMP'S TOUGH LOVE FOR PAKISTAN FINALLY FORCE IT TO PAY A PRICE FOR TERROR?

Pakistan has long tried to prop up its regional relevance and influence, in part, by supporting insurgencies and tolerating terrorist groups that undermine stability in India, as well as neighboring Afghanistan.

These tactics have taken a terrible human toll - even in Pakistan, which has seen more than its share of extremist violence. Yet they are no longer enough to turn India's trajectory.

Pakistan's other recourse for relevance has been to play ""great power"" politics. It has looked to both the U.S. and China to balance Islamabad's relationship with Delhi. And now that's a problem.

The India-U.S. strategic relationship is quickly outpacing relations between America and Pakistan. This latest incident was a case in point. When terrorists struck in Kashmir, the message from the U.S. administration was pretty clear: India, we have your back.

That's not to say U.S.-India ties are frictionless. Washington just dropped India from its Generalized System of Preferences program. That will slap about $5 billion in new tariffs on Indian goods heading to the U.S.

But President Trump has a penchant for running economic, security and diplomatic policies on separate tracks. While Delhi and Washington may continue to spar over how to build better economic ties, the Trump team will continue to press forward to strengthen the strategic partnership with India.

Pakistan clearly lags India in importance as an American strategic ally in the region. But turning to Beijing doesn't seem to offer Islamabad much of value.

So far, what Pakistan has gotten from economic engagement with Beijing is mostly debt. Pakistan's economy is so lackluster that Islamabad is seeking a $12 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. If granted, it would be the 13th bailout the country has received since the 1980s.

Nor does China appear to be delivering the diplomatic clout that Pakistan needs. For example, Beijing couldn't prevent the international Financial Action Task Force from ""grey listing"" Pakistan for its weakness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. In fact, under pressure from the U.S. and others, Pakistan may soon find itself ""blacklisted"" as a non-cooperative state.

In the Pakistan-China relationship, Beijing seems primarily interested in helping itself. Over the long term, the strategic relationship could have little value beyond making Islamabad a tool of Chinese policy and perhaps, someday, a suburb of Beijing.

There is no easy exit for Pakistan. India won't be cowed by terrorism. Further, as the latest incident on the frontier demonstrated, there are limits to intensifying conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries. It was not surprising that Pakistan quickly returned a downed-Indian fighter pilot to deescalate the confrontation.

Further, it doesn't look like Pakistan can leverage either the U.S. or China to pressure India.

Yet dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and accompanying web of corruption that riddle Pakistan presents tremendous challenges as well. On the other hand, a Pakistan that muddles through in South Asia just risks being left further behind.

There should be no joy in Washington at Pakistan's problems. What is in the best interest of the U.S. is a peaceful and prosperous South Asia. But that's not possible without a Pakistan that can partner with others and deliver the kind of regional economic integration that would jumpstart progress.

Washington can't sugarcoat the problem. Pakistan needs to make some fundamental changes. It must stop indulging terrorism and tolerating corruption. It can begin by remaining engaged with those who are willing work for a better national - and regional - future and by punishing those who make trouble for neighboring countries.",551,Fox News,Problem-plagued Pakistan faces incredible challenges beyond its rivalry with India
"Spravato, a mind-altering medication related to the club drug Special K, won U.S. approval Tuesday for patients with hard-to-treat depression. (AP)

A mind-altering medication related to the club drug Special K won U.S. approval Tuesday for patients with hard-to-treat depression, the first in a series of long-overlooked substances being reconsidered for severe forms of mental illness.

The nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson is a chemical cousin of ketamine, which has been used for decades as a powerful anesthetic to prepare patients for surgery. In the 1990s, the medication was adopted as a party drug by the underground rave culture due to its ability to produce psychedelic, out-of-body experiences. More recently, some doctors have given ketamine to people with depression without formal FDA approval.

AS SUICIDE RATES RISE, COLLEGE STUDENTS BAND TOGETHER IN UNPRECEDENTED EFFORT

The Food and Drug Administration approved Spravato as a fast-acting treatment for patients who have failed to find relief with at least two antidepressants. Up to 7.4 million American adults suffer from so-called treatment-resistant depression, which heightens the risk of suicide, hospitalization and other serious harm, according to the FDA.

The drug will cost between $590 and $885 depending on the dosage and before various insurance discounts and rebates.

There have been no major pharmaceutical innovations for depression since the launch of Prozac and related antidepressants in the late 1980s. Those drugs target the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, and can take weeks or months to kick in.

Ketamine and J&J's version work differently than those drugs, targeting a chemical called glutamate that is thought to restore brain connections that help relieve depression.

When the drug works, its effect is almost immediate. That speed ""is a huge thing because depressed patients are very disabled and suffer enormously,"" said Dr. John Mann, a psychiatrist and researcher at Columbia University. If the drug doesn't work, physicians can quickly switch to other options, he noted.

The FDA approved Spravato, known chemically as esketamine, based on study results that showed patients taking the drug experienced a bigger improvement in their depression levels than patients taking a sham treatment, when measured with a psychiatric questionnaire.

The drug is designed to be lower-dose and easier to use than ketamine, which is normally given as an intravenous infusion.

MICHIGAN COMMUNITY REELING AFTER 3 TEENS COMMIT SUICIDE IN LAST 8 MONTHS

Robin Prothro, 60, began taking antidepressants more than 20 years ago. But she says none of the five medications she tried relieved the depression that has stymied her personal and professional life.

Since enrolling in a Spravato trial two years ago, Prothro says her depression has lifted and she's returned to hobbies she abandoned years ago, like gardening.

She takes the drug every two weeks at her psychiatrist's office while reclining in a comfortable chair.

""You can feel it coming on, it's a strong drug,"" she said, describing colors and shapes that drift before her eyes. ""I just let the drug work. I close my eyes and my mind is amazingly quiet.""

PSYCHEDELICS RECONSIDERED

The ketamine-like drug is the first of several psychoactive substances making their way through the U.S. regulatory process as physicians search further afield for new therapies. Researchers are conducting late-stage trials of psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, and MDMA, a euphoria-inducing club drug, as potential treatments for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

""Substantially different agents are only rarely appearing from pharmaceutical companies or other laboratories,"" said Dr. Paul Summergrad, a psychiatrist at Tufts University. ""That's prompting people to investigate other compounds.""

Unlike ketamine, psilocybin and MDMA have no legal medical use. Classified in the same category as heroin and LSD, they are tightly restricted by the federal government. But the FDA's approval of esketamine could smooth their path.

BURDEN OF DEPRESSION

Depression is among the leading causes of disability in the U.S. and is being closely monitored by health authorities amid rising suicides nationwide. In 2017, the U.S. suicide rate rose to 14 deaths per 100,000 people, the highest rate in at least 50 years, according to federal records.

Government officials haven't suggested an explanation for the trend, though academic researchers point to the nation's widening income gap, financial struggles and divisive politics.

J&J's drug will be subject to a number of restrictions due to its abuse potential, side effects and lingering safety questions.

The drug will only be given by accredited specialists who must monitor patients for at least two hours after administration, due to its trippy, disorienting effects. Additionally, all patients will be tracked in a registry to monitor long-term safety and effectiveness.

The immediate impact of ketamine is thought to last just four to seven days and there's no consensus yet on how long patients can benefit from ongoing treatment.

Still, there are few other options for patients who fail to respond to antidepressants. The most effective treatment in such cases, electroshock therapy, requires patients to be fully sedated and can cause persistent memory loss.

Wall Street has high expectations for J&J's medication, with analysts predicting more than $600 million in annual sales by 2022. But J&J will face competition in the marketplace.

A decades-old drug, ketamine is already used off-label to treat depression by some doctors. At least 150 clinics around the U.S. provide treatment with various forms of the drug, which is available as a low-cost generic. Patients often pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for intravenous infusions of the drug over several weeks or months. Such therapies are generally not covered by insurance because they haven't been approved as safe and effective by FDA regulators.

Some doctors plan to offer both ketamine and the new J&J drug.

Dr. Steve Levine says having FDA-approved standards for dosing and administering the new drug should raise standards in the field and drive out some of the bad actors who are not qualified to treat depression.

"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. - Three years after Democrats witnessed a vicious presidential primary battle between eventual nominee Hillary Clinton and one-time longshot Bernie Sanders, there are rising concerns that a revival of the war of words between their two camps could hurt the party in 2020.

""I think there's a small segment of people in both camps who harbor significant resentment,"" a veteran New Hampshire-based Democratic campaign strategist told Fox News.

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

""There are Bernie people who have constantly attacked Clinton and there are Clinton people who resent the primary of 2016. I think this is a lingering problem that's going to find its way into the 2020 nomination process,"" warned the strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely.

Kathy Sullivan, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire, urged that ""it's time for people to move on. The 2016 primary was three years ago.... We have another election coming up and that's what we should be focusing on.""

And former state Sen. Burt Cohen pleaded: ""They need to stop that.""

HICKENLOOPER BECOMES 14TH DEMOCRAT TO JUMP INTO 2020 RACE

""We have to put that behind us and unite,"" emphasized Cohen, a leading Granite State Sanders supporter from the 2016 campaign.

Cohen was in the crowd at a joint rally at Portsmouth High School in July of 2016, when Sanders and Clinton tried to bury the hatchet in hopes of putting to rest a bitter and contentious battle for the Democratic presidential nomination that saw Sanders blast the party's establishment favorite.

Sanders vowed ""to do everything I can to ensure that she will be the next president"" and Clinton thanked her rival, proclaiming she was ""proud to be fighting alongside you.""

But the fragile peace between the independent senator from Vermont and the former U.S. secretary of state was tepid at best. And following Clinton's shocking loss to GOP nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 general election, Clinton and many of her top staffers blamed Sanders and his legions for her defeat.

BLOOMBERG NOT RUNNING FOR WHITE HOUSE IN 2020

Fast forward nearly three years and the bad blood is simmering anew.

Sanders, who last month launched his second straight White House bid, is the early front-runner in an ever-expanding field of Democratic presidential contenders. He tops many of the latest public opinion polls, hauled in an eye-popping $6 million in fundraising in his first 24 hours as a candidate, and drew some 25,000 people to his first two rallies.

Clinton's supposedly out, saying in an interview on Monday that ""I'm not running, but I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.""

She reportedly is keeping the door open a crack, but her Shermanesque comments certainly calmed speculation that she might seek a rematch with Trump in 2020.

""I want to be sure that people understand I'm going to keep speaking out,"" she added.

But it's not what Clinton's saying but rather comments from some of her top aides from the 2016 campaign that are roiling the 2020 waters.

Cable TV and Twitter have been the platforms in recent weeks for on-the-record and on-background soundbites and quotes from former Clinton aides and top supporters taking aim at Sanders.

Ex-Clinton staffers savaged Sanders over his use of private jets during the 2016 general election while he was stumping across the country for the Democratic nominee, as detailed in a recent Politico article.

Explanations from the Sanders camp that the senator needed to fly private jets in order to keep a non-stop itinerary of nearly 40 rallies in 13 states during the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign didn't fly with many Clinton supporters.

Zac Petkanas, the Clinton's 2016 campaign's director of rapid response, fired away, saying ""Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe.""

Michael Briggs, spokesman for the Sanders 2016 campaign, said in response that members of Clinton's team are some of the ""biggest a--holes in American politics.""

""You can see why she's (Clinton) one of the most disliked politicians in America,"" he added.

When Sanders said in a recent radio interview that ""we have go to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,"" longtime Clinton policy adviser Neera Tanden fired back.

""At a time where folks feel under attack because of who they are, saying race or gender or sexual orientation or identity doesn't matter is not off, it's simply wrong,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Many in Clinton world remember the nasty online comments from some Sanders supporters during the 2016 intra-party primary slugfest. Last month, Sanders urged leading backers to ""do our very best to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents"" rather than spotlight ""personalities or past grievances.""

Sanders himself invited criticism from Clinton backers during an interview last week on ""The View."" Asked if he would be asking for advice from the 2016 nominee - as some rivals for the nomination have been doing - Sanders answered, ""I suspect not....Hillary and I have fundamental differences.""

Longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill took to Twitter to punch back.

""I don't know who our nominee is going to be but I am damn sure that beating Trump & getting America back on the right footing is going to require a unified Democratic Party, so crap like this 613 days before Election Day is irresponsible, counter-productive, & sets us all back,"" he tweeted.

The war of words is worrying some longtime Sanders supporters in New Hampshire, where the senator's crushing victory over Clinton in the February 2016 primary launched him into the bloody battle with the eventual nominee.

""They need to learn the lessons of why they lost what should have been an easy victory and just live with so we can win [in 2020],"" said Cohen, a member of the Sanders steering committee in the Granite State.

""We have to keep our eyes on the prize, which is saving America from Trumpism,"" he added. ""Carrying forth 2016 bitterness does no good.""

New Hampshire executive councilor Andru Volinsky called the attacks ""white noise and a distraction.""

Volinsky, who served as legal counsel for the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire and helped lead the efforts to bridge the differences between the Sanders and Clinton camps in the crucial general election battleground state during the summer and autumn of 2016, argued that ""I think Bernie's done what he's supposed to do and I think we need to focus on getting Trump out of office.""

Sullivan, a former longtime state party chair before serving as a DNC committee member, backed Clinton in the 2016 first-in-the-nation primary. But she agreed that it's time to move past the war of words.

""I just think there's some unnecessary sniping going on right now and that it would be in the best interest of everyone if both sides just said 'that's enough. Let's just move on to the future,'"" she urged.",554,Fox News,Dems fear never-ending Clinton-Sanders feud could damage party in 2020: 'They need to stop'
"House Democrats are expanding the Russia probe to investigate potential criminal actions by the president; Kevin Corke has the details from the White House.

Democrats seem to be preparing for bad news to come from the Mueller investigation. In their eyes, bad news would be a lack of evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

They are now engaging in a fishing expedition to set up perjury traps and make a case for ""obstruction of justice,"" even though the Mueller witch hunt is likely to come up empty of any underlying crime.

This week, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., served document requests to 81 agencies, entities and individuals in an effort to help Democrats take the White House in 2020.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE WEAPONIZING THE PROCESS AGAINST TRUMP

As Fox News reported, these document requests were served ""as part of a new probe into 'alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump.'"" Rep. Nadler claims that this is part of Congress' oversight functions, but this really should be considered a campaign contribution to the Democrat who eventually wins the nomination.

The power of the Congress to engage in oversight hearings is not without limits. According to the House of Representatives' office of History, Art & Archives, ""The Constitution says nothing about congressional investigations and oversight, but the authority to conduct investigations is implied since Congress possesses 'all legislative powers.' The Supreme Court determined that the framers intended for Congress to seek out information when crafting or reviewing legislation. George Mason of Virginia said at the Federal Convention that Members of Congress 'are not only Legislators but they possess inquisitorial powers. They must meet frequently to inspect the Conduct of the public offices.'""

This power derives from Article I, Sec.1, yet it is not an explicit power. The power to investigate crimes and conduct trials resides in the executive branch and the judicial branch, not the legislative branch. Therefore Rep. Nadler is arguably overreaching with his new fishing expedition because this is merely a partisan exercise.

The American people will not stand for government by investigation and the wasting of resources intended to slow and harass President Trump's run in 2020. This is a well-funded and high-profile exercise in searching for Republicans to entrap and harass.

The oversight functions fall into three categories. Again, according to the House of Representatives' own website, ""Hearings are most commonly held for three reasons: to consider pending legislation; to investigate issues that may require legislation in the future; and, to investigate and oversee federal programs. They reflect the most important issues of the day and what occupies congressional attention.""

This does not include an implied power to criminalize politics and to use the power of the Congress to engage in partisan investigations. Make no mistake, these are investigations that intend to help Democrats win back the White House, and if that fails, to use the impeachment power of Congress to remove the president from office when he wins another term.

This partisan investigation is being funded by the taxpayer and includes two Trump-hating lawyers, Barry Berke, and Norman Eisen, as consultants to help them attack the presidency.

President Trump is correct to classify this as ""presidential harassment."" This is politically motivated, as evidenced by the fact that the Clinton campaign was never subjected to these types of hearings, and President Obama was never subject to this use of congressional power to support a campaign against him.

"The so-called deep state is often weaponized to reflect current orthodoxies.

All great empires of the past created deep states.

The permanent bureaucracies and elite hangers-on adapted as imperial conditions dictated. Imperial Spain's El Escorial outside Madrid, the courts of Renaissance Venice, and Byzantium's Constantinople, or the thousands who lived at 18th-century Versailles, were all thronged with court functionaries. They were the embryos of nonstop dramas of intrigue and coups, and often immune to periodic changes even in autocratic heads of state.

The Byzantine emperor Justinian savagely curbed the influence of his bureaucratic opponents only through the infamous slaughter of the Nika riots of AD 532. The key for the deep-state careerist was always survival, even more than public service. The ubiquitous fifth-century B.C. Athenian Alcibiades was variously an Athenian democratic imperialist, a suspected oligarchic sympathizer, a wanted outlaw of the Athenian state, a turncoat working for Sparta, a returning Athenian democrat, and an aristocratic exile under the protection of Persia -- the common denominator being a manipulative skilled survivor of the politics of the Greek city-state.

Similar was the much later example of the ""versatile"" French minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Talleyrand for more than 40 years was a fixture of the permanent Paris court and thus in succession an advocate and betrayer of the Ancien R√©gime, the French Revolution, Napoleon, and the restored monarchy. His loyalty was to the career of Monsieur Talleyrand rather than to France, much less to monarchy, the revolution, republican government, or dictatorship.

Since the U.S. post-war era, the yearly growth of American state and federal government has been exponential. By 2017, there were nearly 3 million civilian federal workers and another 1.3 million Americans in the uniformed military. Over 22 million local, state, and federal workers had made government the largest employment sector. The three largest American unions were respectively the National Education Association (mostly teachers and public-education staff ), Service Employees International Union, and the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees. All routinely endorsed progressive candidates. Unions as a rule in the 21st century have grown only among government workers. Over the past four decades, the vast majority of public employees without master's or doctoral degrees have usually achieved compensation packages higher than their private-sector counterparts. Union membership until 2018 was mandatory for many public employees. Until stopped by a Supreme Court decision, dues had pro forma been automatically deducted by their unions, regardless of actual membership status.

Bureaucracies had become politicized on the premise that big government both required high taxes that Democrats more than Republicans ensured, and could be weaponized to further political agendas and avoid cutbacks in state employment and its compensation. Most federal unions gave far greater donations to Democratic than Republican candidates. According to a report in the Hill, in 2016 about 95 percent of all donations from federal workers to the two presidential campaigns went to Hillary Clinton -- apparently on the premise that her agenda of greater regulation, higher taxes, and more entitlements would, in particular, translate into more federal jobs and higher salaries, and in general support a shared philosophy that the administrative state plays the central role in American life and culture.

The insidious power of the unelected administrative state is easy to understand. After all, it governs the most powerful aspects of modern American life: taxes, surveillance, criminal-justice proceedings, national security, and regulation. The nightmares of any independent trucker or small-business person are being audited by the IRS, having communications surveilled, or being investigated by a government regulator or prosecutor.

The reach of the deep state ultimately is based on two premises. One, improper government-worker behavior is difficult to audit or at least to be held to account, given that it is protected both by union contracts and civil-service law. And, two, a government appointee or bureaucrat has the unlimited resources of the state behind him, while the targeted private citizen in a federal indictment, tax audit, or regulation violation not only does not, but is assumed also not to have the means even to provide an adequate legal defense.

Lois Lerner, director of the Exempt Organizations division of the IRS, more or less got away with targeting mostly conservative groups before the 2012 election. She had ensured that dozens of nonprofits would not receive prompt tax-exempt status and ostensibly oppose Obama's agendas. Eric Holder's Justice Department surveilled various Associated Press reporters and especially Fox News's James Rosen on the suspicion that they were receiving leaked information from Obama administration sources.

The so-called deep state is often weaponized to reflect current orthodoxies. In the past 30 years its operating premises have embraced multiculturalism, feminism, and identity-politics diversity -- more or less the sacred tenets that Trump has targeted. Between 2009 and 2016 the Obama administration, to take one example, had recalibrated the war on terror and had hoped to change its reality through the use of state-sanctioned euphemisms. Obama sought to use the apparat to institutionalize the notion that radical Islam had no intrinsic connection with terrorism, and that adherents of Islam had no greater propensity to incite violence against Westerners than did followers of other religions -- political correctness that Donald Trump campaigned against throughout 2016.",556,nationalreview.com,The Deep State Past and Present | National Review

I was invited to speak at CPAC this year, which is a good sign given that I'm not exactly beloved by MAGA Nation these days. I passed. Still, I don't begrudge conservatives attending CPAC, nor do I think that going amounts to an endorsement or rejection of the president and his ideas.

If you've been to CPAC, you know it's a bit like a right-wing Comic-Con, albeit with marginally fewer cosplayers. Some go to be part of the show, others just to take it all in. No one expects everybody dressed as Marvel's Thor to endorse DC's Superman.

But to the extent that CPAC is an infomercial for what the organizers want to sell as conservatism today, it really was TPAC, with the commander in chief cast as the Man of Steel, by which I mean the allegedly hamburger-hunting Stalin himself, whose nom de guerre literally meant ""man of steel.""

Trump is not a dictator, but his two-hour speech, possibly the longest ever delivered by a U.S. president, shared many of the traits associated with demagogues who feed off a cult of personality.

Very long speeches are a way of proving dominance over an audience. In 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin held a press conference that lasted for nearly five hours. Fidel Castro would routinely give speeches that exceeded that. Got somewhere to go? Too bad, I'm the only game in town. Stalin once gave a lengthy speech that was later released on vinyl. The entire B-side consisted of recorded applause.

Trump's speech was a virtuoso performance, showing off the man in full. But the overriding theme to the pudding was that there is only Trump. One of the great challenges for conservatives in the Trump era has been to navigate between supporting the man's policies and supporting the man.

Over the last two years, you could hear echoes of this tension in the ubiquitous refrain: ""He's better than Hillary would have been."" That's a defensible proposition for conservatives, but never before in the history of the conservative movement have conservatives lowered the bar to the Democratic nominee the president faced in the prior election.

No serious conservative defended George H. W. Bush by saying, ""At least he's better than Dukakis would have been!"" And no one denounced conservative critics of the 41st president as being secret Michael Dukakis supporters.

In Trump's sprawling address, which he began by literally hugging the American flag, he denounced and castigated any competing source of conservative authority, including several people who served in his own administration.

His fact-challenged braggadocio and his whining -- about the media, the Mueller probe and every other source of inconvenience -- was an at times brilliant, at times pathetic effort to encourage the audience to invest themselves in Trump himself, not his ideas or the ideas that have formed the glue of the conservative movement for decades. Trump's instincts now have papal authority.

The schism between defending the man and the agenda was obliterated. Instead of loving what he's doing despite his faults, the audience was implicitly asked to love him because of his faults. His celebrity is all that matters, and his narcissism is infectious.

In his 1962 masterpiece ""The Image,"" in which he introduced the concept of the pseudo-event, Boorstin posited that a celebrity is a ""human pseudo-event.""

""We try to make our celebrities stand in for the heroes we no longer have, or for those who have been pushed out of our view,"" Boorstin wrote. ""Yet the celebrity is usually nothing greater than a more-publicized version of us. In imitating him, we are simply imitating ourselves.""

That was the part of the message that got Trump the nomination and the White House two years ago. And now it's the entirety of the message from the main stage at TPAC.",557,nationalreview.com,Trump Became a 'Human Pseudo-Event' at CPAC | National Review
"Democrats in the House are trying to deal with freshman lawmaker Rep. Ilhan Omar who keeps saying nasty things about her colleagues and Israel; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill.

It's Groundhog Day in our nation's capital, with anti-Semitism poking its head out from beneath the Capitol dome. Again and again, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., keeps making anti-Semitic comments that deserve condemnation by all members of Congress - in fact, by all Americans.

Only two months ago, Omar issued a half-hearted apology for stating in 2012: ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.""

Then just last month, Omar issued an ""unequivocal"" apology filled with equivocations after insinuating that if members of Congress support Israel they must have been bought off by Jews. This is a clear reference to the age-old anti-Semitic lie that wealthy and evil Jews secretly control government and much of society.

RABBI ABRAHAM COOPER: REP. ILHAN OMAR SHOULD BE CONDEMNED -- RELIGIOUS, RACIAL AND ETHNIC HATRED MUST FIND NO REFUGE IN CONGRESS

And here we are again, starting off March with Omar peddling one of the oldest anti-Semitic tropes in the book - dual loyalty. This slur on the patriotism of Jewish Americans claims we can't really be loyal Americans because owe our allegiance to Israel rather than the United States. This time there apparently won't even be an ""apology"" coming.

Some shrug off Omar's clear anti-Semitism, claiming she is just new to Congress and na√Øve. But it's painfully obvious that she knows exactly what she's doing. For this and many other reasons, Omar should be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She never should have been appointed to this important position in the first place.

Omar is a strong supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement that seeks to isolate Israel from the world and brand it as a pariah among nations. BDS has a goal of strangling Israel by cutting off all trade, tourism, cultural contact, foreign aid and military ties with other nations.

Unfortunately, the hatred that increasingly pours out of the House chamber emboldens anti-Semites and legitimizes rhetoric and stereotypes that have rightfully been shunned in our society.

On top of this, Omar has also requested leniency for ISIS fighters. She has blamed U.S. foreign policy for the al-Shabaab terrorist attack in Kenya. And she has expressed support for disputed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, a socialist dictator who oppresses his people and has brought economic disaster to his country.

Someone holding these extremist positions should not be elevated and empowered to oversee U.S. foreign policy.

Now House Democratic leaders are stating that that they will bring a resolution to the House floor this week condemning anti-Semitism and reportedly condemning anti-Muslim prejudice as well. That's a start, but not enough.

In addition to removing Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, House Democratic leadership should bring to the floor House Resolution 72, a bill with 100 co-sponsors that I authored with Reps. Ted Budd, R-N.C. and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. This measure condemns the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate rising in the United States and around the world.

We must come together and explicitly and unequivocally reject the anti-Semitism infiltrating U.S. politics, college campuses and the halls of Congress.

There are members of Congress who have embraced Louis Farrakhan, a blatant anti-Semite, who referred to Hitler as ""a very great man.""

There are members of Congress who have championed the BDS movement, the founder of which has stated: ""We are witnessing the rapid demise of Zionism, and nothing can be done to save it, for Zionism is intent on killing itself. I, for one, support euthanasia.""

In a frightening development, Jewish students on college campuses across the country are being subjected to anti-Semitism under the guise of the BDS movement. Contemporary anti-Semites claim they have nothing against Jews - they just hate the Jewish state.

At New York University, following the student government's passage of a resolution supporting BDS, NYU's Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life was temporarily closed after a student issued threatening messages on social media expressing his desire for Zionists to die.

A University of Michigan professor refused to write a letter of recommendation for a qualified student to study abroad solely because she was seeking to study in Israel.

A Students for Justice in Palestine co-founder and University of California Berkeley professor spoke at a national conference and shared an anti-Semitic meme of an Orthodox Jewish person in his presentation.

There are countless other examples as well. This is happening to Jewish students all across our nation. We cannot and must not allow rhetoric and policy coming out of Congress to enable this behavior.

Unfortunately, the hatred that increasingly pours out of the House chamber emboldens anti-Semites and legitimizes rhetoric and stereotypes that have rightfully been shunned in our society.

I went through kindergarten through 12th grade, college, law school and four years of active duty in the U.S. Army and I never once experienced anti-Semitism - until I came to the U.S. House of Representatives.

Anti-Semitism has no business infiltrating American politics, it has no business infiltrating our college campuses, and it has no business in the halls of Congress.

It's clear we cannot wait any longer to make it abundantly clear that this vile and ancient prejudice that claimed 6 million Jewish lives in the Holocaust is un-American and has no place in our country.

House Democratic leadership must bring House Resolution 72 to the floor for a vote immediately and remove Rep. Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

It is outrageous and disgraceful that Omar claims support for Israel comes from people bought off by Jews and claims that support of the U.S.-Israel relationship amounts to foreign allegiance to another government.

"Expanded Democratic investigation targets Trump family, business and White House

As House Democrats expand their investigations into President Trump, there may be an opposite effect among undecided voters, Townhall.com politics editor Guy Benson suggested Tuesday.

This week, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to 81 Trump associates and entities in search of documents for various investigations. Trump has repeatedly slammed the ""stone cold crazy"" Democrats and deemed their recent expansion as ""presidential harassment.""

During Tuesday's ""Special Report"" All-Star panel, Benson -- along with Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason -- weighed in on the potential political consequences Democrats might face if their wave of investigations into the president backfires.

Benson noted the Democrats' sudden ""moving on"" from the Mueller probe amid shifting expectations that the report will be a ""dud."" He then credited former Obama adviser David Axelrod, who tweeted that Democrats ""run the risk"" of irritating the public with their various investigations.

""Some unaffiliated people and undecided voters might come around to the 'harassment, witch hunt' mentality,"" Benson told the panel.

Hemingway expressed a similar sentiment, insisting that Trump's ""presidential harassment' claim will work in his favor because the investigations into Trump's business ""fits that narrative"" of congressional overreach rather than ""legitimate oversight.""

"Candace Owens hosted a Blexit -- or black exit from the Democrat Party -- event on Sunday in Richmond, Virginia, where hundreds of people gathered to hear from Owens and several other featured speakers, including Breitbart News Entertainment Editor Jerome Hudson.

Hundreds of eager event attendees wearing MAGA hats and Blexit t-shirts gathered at The National Theater in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday, to attend the Blexit rally. This was Owens' second Blexit event of the year, the first having been held in Los Angeles, California, in January.

Breitbart News was present at the event and had the opportunity to speak with attendees and speakers. While waiting in line to get into the event, one young attendee, Chandler, told Breitbart News he believes he has ""awoken earlier than most people"" due to having ""fantastic parents.""

""I had fantastic parents that allowed me to, instead of being indoctrinated -- do my own research,"" said the young activist, ""and when I did my research and found these things about the Democrat and the Republican Party, I was angry -- because my people had been lied to for generations.""

""And I just didn't know what to do with it, but then, I went to YBLS, and my skills were cultivated and activated, and after that, I just wanted to help people -- I wanted to free my people, both Latino and black, and create a better future for my people.""

""I get a lot of flack from people,"" said another event attendee, Russell, ""They'll see my [Blexit] shirt and ask me about it, and when I tell them what it's all about -- they'll look at me like I'm crazy -- like, 'don't you know that you're not supposed to be thinking that way?'""

Russell added that he has a ""Trump 2016"" sticker on his car, and is often questioned when getting out of his car. ""They'll see me get out of the car, and they'll go, 'Is that your car?' -- 'You're a Trump supporter?'""

""It's just crazy,"" continued the Blexit attendee, ""It's just amazing that I actually have to justify -- the only reason they ask those questions is because of the color of my skin.""

""I've always been a supporter of the Democratic Party,"" said a third attendee, Reginald, ""but now -- since I've started to now do my own research and find out that the Democratic party is not for minorities, of any race, whether it be black, Latino, Asian.""

""Now I'm getting the bash for making my own decision and being a free thinker.""

The event-goers waiting outside of The National Theater did not look like the people who the establishment media would likely want you to believe are conservatives. In fact, there was no mainstream media outlet present to cover the Blexit event.

Sunday's Blexit audience gathered to hear remarks from Candace Owens, as well as featured speakers such as conservative politician E. W. Jackson, political commentator Dinesh D'Souza, and Turning Point USA Director of Urban Engagement Brandon Tatum, among several others.

One speaker was Breitbart's own entertainment editor, Jerome Hudson, who encouraged attendees to harness their power as citizen journalists, echoing the sentiments of the news outlet's late founder, Andrew Breitbart.

""Our founder, Andrew Breitbart, famously said that politics is downstream from culture,"" said Hudson to his audience, ""That's why your voice on social media is so important. You have a megaphone in your pocket that empowers you to fight back.""

""Long before the social media movement in America exploded, Andrew Breitbart used to hold up his phone at rallies just like this one and tell the audience to harness their power as citizen journalists. See, you are more powerful than you realize.""

Owens announced her ""Blexit"" project last October, aimed at leading ""the black exit from the Democrat Party,"" in which she vowed to take her mission of exodus to cities controlled by Democrat politicians.

This made the state of Virginia an obvious choice for hosting the second Blexit event, considering recent scandals involving the state's governor, Ralph Northam, and attorney general, Mark Herring.

In January, Northam had been exposed on video casually endorsing infanticide, and then, days later, the governor's medical school yearbook photo was leaked to the public, displaying one individual in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan outfit.

While the reaction to Northam's revealed stance on infanticide was -- in comparison to his leaked yearbook photo -- virtually nonexistent, (despite abortion having a disproportionate effect on the black community), Northam's yearbook photo, on the other hand, elicited a response of public outrage across the country, as well as calls for his resignation.

Governor Northam has since successfully dodged calls for his resignation.

Owens told Breitbart News she had chosen Richmond, Virginia, to shine a light on ""the hypocrisy of the left.""

""The problem is that there's not enough of a reaction,"" said Owens, ""What we're seeing down here is that they're trying to just gloss it over, say it's okay, and then we're supposed to all go back to normal.""

""This, of course, would never be allowed on the conservative side,"" added Owens.

Owens also noted Northam's stance on late-term abortions, adding, ""This is a perfect time to talk to black America, Hispanic America, and all of America, of the hypocrisy of the left, and the results of these progressive policies, which are always regressive for communities that are afflicted by them.""

Additionally, Owens touched upon Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""The idea that a sitting person in Congress can refer to a black conservative as a token or say that they are participating in tokenism, that's a racial slur,"" said Owens of Ocasio-Cortez's recent tweet in reference to Trump staffer, Lynne Patton.

""This is what I mean when I say that we give a pass to and an okay to people on the left.""

E. W. Jackson, who was Northam's opponent for lieutenant governor of Virginia in 2013, added that Northam had once actually refused to shake his hand.

""These liberals really think that they have a free pass to do and say whatever they want because they are liberals, when in fact, they are the most condescending, paternalistic, racist individuals in this country,"" said Jackson, as the crowd roared with applause and cheers in concurrence.

""Because they think they own black people, they think they own Latino people,"" continued Jackson, ""and it's time to tell them, 'You don't own us, we are our own people and we will chart the course of our own lives!""

""We will think for ourselves, we will write for ourselves, we will speak for ourselves!""

""I want to tell you young people something,"" added Jackson, ""don't believe the socialist lie that you've gotta have government -- you can do anything you want to do because this is the greatest nation on the face of the earth for fulfilling your God-given potential.""

The Blexit audience responded with a standing ovation and chants of ""USA!""

"""Oakland teachers ended their seven-day strike Sunday and will return to schools Monday after approving a new contract that won them salary increases and concessions on class sizes and staff workloads,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

""Though it falls short of many members' raised expectations, the new contract is a significant step forward: it grants educators an 11 percent pay raise and also includes gains on issues like class size and support-staff ratios,"" wrote Eric Blanc, author of the upcoming book Red State Revolt: The Teachers' Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics, on Monday at the Marxist Jacobin Magazine:

But it would be a mistake to judge the strike's outcome only on the basis of the final contract provisions. The big wins lie elsewhere.

Oakland's walkout has energized and transformed tens of thousands of teachers, students, and community members to fight for more. Educators have felt their own power -- and they have recognized their class enemies. Though the war to save Oakland schools is far from over, after this strike, the city will never be the same. . .

Tim Marshall -- a middle school science teacher, strike cluster leader, and member of the Democratic Socialists of America -- noted, ""Just a few weeks ago at my school site, only a few people were interested in talking about how to stop privatization, closures, and charters. But now that's the only thing anybody wants to discuss."" This transformation was not limited to educators: students of all ages walked the picket lines, spoke at rallies, and drew political signs -- many reflecting a remarkable degree of class consciousness -- in support of both themselves and their teachers. . .

At the beginning of the strike, Marshall, a teacher in the Oakland Unified School District for 22 years and a Democratic Socialist of America (DSA) activist, explained to Meagan Day -- a DSA member and a Jacobin Magazine staff writer -- why the young socialists who have recently begun teaching and joined the Oakland Education Association (OEA) were so critical to the launch of the strike:

I think the additional wild card has been these young people. The young people of our union are much more fearless resisters against their principals. They're also much more vulnerable, because the rents are rising and the reality of being a twenty-five-year-old teacher is not the same as when I did it. They never paid us well in Oakland, but rent in Oakland used to be cheap.

And the support of younger socialists has been crucial. It's not like how it used to be, with radicals isolated in their unions, the residual effects of the Cold War and red-baiting forcing them to disguise their politics. DSA is much more out front.

The role that East Bay DSA has played has been really welcome in the union. There are DSA members who are teachers on the organizing committee, and there were DSA members out on picket lines all over town this morning. In the lead-up to the strike DSA has cosponsored events with the union and taken on a huge logistical burden to make them happen. Bread for Ed, a massive fundraiser to feed kids during the strike, would not have happened without DSA. Much of the solidarity school organizing would not have happened without DSA.

As the Chronicle reported, the raise came from a public school district that is financially insolvent:

Oakland Unified has been hemorrhaging money for years. It faces a $30 million budget shortfall next year and a $60 million deficit the year after that.

The district is not alone in poor money management. In June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the Education Trailer Bill, which will provide financial relief to districts across the state. Funding from the bill will cover up to 75 percent of the Oakland's shortfall next year, up to 50 percent the next year, and up to 25 percent in the third year.

The energy from the young socialist teachers apparently inspired a number of their students to join the picket lines.

""[R]oughly 25 students ... joined teachers on the picket line in front of Oakland Tech Friday morning, on the second day of a districtwide teacher strike,"" KQED reported.

Blanc concluded in his Jacobin Magazine article that the success of the Oakland teachers strike was just the beginning.

""[T]he next phase of the struggle also has to be part of a massive statewide movement -- notably, to pass a statewide charter moratorium and to approve a 2020 ballot initiative to end Prop 13's infamous commercial tax loopholes,"" he wrote.",561,Breitbart,#RedforEd Scores Victory in Oakland Teachers Strike
"""A great example of male grooming [in politics] would be something like Susan Collins,"" Amber Tamblyn told The Hollywood Reporter.

Tamblyn also said that she thinks the 2016 election and the way Hillary Clinton was treated caused the female ""rage"" behind the #MeToo movement.

""I do think a lot of [the new momentum] was created by the 2016 election,"" The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants actress said. ""[N]ot so much the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, but the complete and utter annihilation and very dark mythologizing of Hillary Clinton as an incapable woman.""

""Whether or not you actually voted for her, or liked her even, we can all agree that pervasive and horrible sexism and misogyny played a huge part in her loss in 2016,"" she said.

"With zero apologies to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the chickens of the Democratic Party are coming home to roost.

Dems are now squawking mad over the overtly anti-Semitic comments of freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. With some fanfare, speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, citing charges Omar has raised repeatedly, including ""the myth of dual loyalty.""

Unfortunately, Omar's colleagues are not mad enough to name the very person whose conduct they are denouncing. Nor, as it turned out, did they have the votes even to do that. Their latest plan is to water the resolution down to mush by also condemning other forms of hate, including Islamophobia.

Their cowardice is not incidental to the problem. It is the problem.

Nor is it a coincidence that the Democratic Party is increasingly both the anti-Israel party and home to a growing number of anti-Semites. To be clear, the two things are not always the same, but something is going on when both are defining elements of a political organization.

One obvious truth is that Dems have failed to deal with anti-Semitism forthrightly, and now are confronted by a metastasizing cancer in their ranks.

Years ago, such as in 1984, when Jesse Jackson referred to New York as ""Hymietown,"" the outcry was slow at first but eventually unanimous. But Democrats are a different party today, in part because they moved sharply to the left under President Barack Obama. He had both prominent Jewish backers and a 20-year relationship with Rev. Wright, whose sermons mixed anti-Semitism with anti-Americanism.

Another development was Obama's effort to lure Iran in from the pariah-state cold despite its vow to eliminate Israel. And as part of the party's increased focus on social justice and income inequality, it found itself making common cause with radical bedfellows, including Occupy Wall Street, anarchists and other fringe elements.

To this day, the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan, who has long embraced dehumanizing imagery and language about Jews, is nonetheless held in high regard by some Democrats, including a handful of top black elected officials. A 2005 picture of Obama with Farrakhan, taken at a Congressional Black Caucus event, only recently surfaced, with the photographer saying he was pressured to keep it secret to protect Obama from criticism.

Tellingly, the emergence of the photo did more to normalize Farrakhan than hurt Obama.

While some far-left groups incorporate anti-Semitism into their global conspiracy theories, others couch their criticism of Israel only in political terms. Yet they never hold despotic regimes, such as Iran, Russia or China, to the same standards they hold Israel, reflecting both their own implicit bigotry and much of the United Nations' as well.

Consider two groups, the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement and Students for Justice in Palestine, which sometimes overlap and have vocal representation on many college campuses, including in New York City.

The standard indoctrination equates Zionism with colonialism, and Jews with white oppressors. To be fair, these ideas are echoed in the national liberal media, including The New York Times, where Israel is blamed for everything wrong in the Middle East and where demands are made on Jews to make major concessions for peace while excuses are made for the fact that many Muslims refuse even to recognize Israel's right to exist.

Is it any surprise that there is a rise of anti-Semitic incidents in America and in New York, where such incidents make up more than half of the hate crimes reported?

The various threads of Jew hatred, ancient and modern, discreet and naked, meet in the person of Linda Sarsour, a BDS supporter who helped found the Women's March, part of the resistance movement against President Trump. Sarsour, a Palestinian-American, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements and she and other leaders of the movement stand accused of discriminating against Jewish women.

Sarsour, who supported Bernie Sanders in 2016, is also a big supporter of Mayor de Blasio and received city grants for her Arab American Association, including $500,000 in 2016 alone.

Naturally, Sarsour defended Rep. Omar, and Tuesday she denounced Pelosi for even trying to condemn her anti-Semitism. ""Nancy is a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the dirty work of powerful white men,"" Sarsour wrote on Facebook. ""God forbid the men are upset.""

Ah yes, race, gender, religion -- they wouldn't be Democrats if identity politics weren't driving the bus.

None of this is to suggest there are no anti-Semites on the right. There clearly are, including those in white-supremacist groups, such as appeared in the infamous 2017 rally at Charlottesville, Va.

At least some are members of the Republican Party.

But there is a major difference as it relates to Israel and Judaism: The evangelical Christian movement is almost exclusively Republican, and it is a fervent supporter of Israel growing out of biblical history and because Israel allows access to Christian holy sites in Jerusalem that were mostly closed under Arab rule.

As a result, any Republican who does not support Israel likely would be shunned by the evangelical movement, which in some states constitutes the largest single bloc of GOP voters.

As Democrats tear themselves apart over what to do about Omar, if anything, they must first realize they have no one to blame but themselves. Maybe then they will also realize that anti-Semitism, like most cancers, is fatal unless it's removed.

It's news that Hillary Clinton finally said publicly what was obvious -- that she wasn't running in 2020. But it was odd that she first told tiny News12 in Westchester, owned by cable operator Altice.

""I'm not running, but I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,"" Clinton told a reporter there, before pretending to be amazed at the nation's sharp divisions.

""We've just gotten so polarized,"" she said. ""We've gotten into really opposing camps unlike anything I've ever seen in my adult life.""

This was just after she gave another speech where she said the election was stolen from her and Trump is a threat to democracy.

"Veteran Rep. Greg Meeks has emerged as a front-runner to become the next chairman of the Queens Democratic Party, sources said Tuesday night.

Meeks, the 11-term congressman first elected in 1998 to represent southern Queens, has been in conversations with borough party officials about taking the reins after former Rep. Joe Crowley stepped down as the longtime party chief last month.

June Bunch, a longtime district leader from Hollis and vice chair of the party, is filling in as the interim chair.

Bunch confirmed that Meeks is a contender for the post.

Asked who's she supporting to become the permanent chair, Bunch said, ""Greg my co-district leader. Who do you think?""

She declined further comment.

Another party insider said, ""Greg is well respected within the party. He's known as a consensus builder and listens to everyone.""

The power shift in Queens was triggered by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset victory over Crowley in last June's Democratic primary in the 14th congressional district that takes in western Queens and parts of The Bronx.

Despite losing his seat, Crowley was re-elected party chair last September. But he quit last month after taking a job with a D.C. lobbying firm.

The Queens Democratic Party had been considered a force in city politics. But the power of the party machine, as elsewhere, has diminished.

There are political challenges in a diverse and changing borough grappling with gentrification.

Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as a social media star -- a force all her own -- after defeating Crowley, which has pulled the party further to the left.

The leftward tilt has been exacerbated by gentrification on or near Ocasio-Cortez's turf in the neighborhoods along the Queens waterfront that border Manhattan -- Long Island City, Astoria, Sunnyside and Woodside.

Many elected Democrats in other parts of Queens- Meeks among them -- have maintained strong ties to the businesses community as well labor unions in a borough that is home to two job-generating airports, a casino and thriving shopping districts.

To put that question in business jargon terms, should movies continue to be bundled to theaters, or should they be unbundled to appear anywhere -- even on a tiny-screened smart phone?

That's the big fight in Hollywood right now: to bundle or not to bundle? It's a question that has implications for just about everything, including politics.

As one of his flacks put it, ""Steven feels strongly about the difference between the streaming and theatrical situation.""

Of course, as observers have pointed out, the idea of a motion picture has always been in, well, motion. That is, from amateurish shorts made for storefront nickelodeons, to dream factory productions premiering in luxurious movie palaces, to made-for-TV movies, to direct-to-video VCRs and DVDs, and now to streaming networks capable of greenlighting nine-figure movies, the only constant has been the desire to be entertained.

So we can see: over the last 120 years, motion pictures have been bundled into many different distribution platforms, only then to be unbundled -- and then bundled into new kinds of platforms. It's a seesaw, as new technologies tip the balance back and forth, from bundling to unbundling.

Back in the '90s, Internet venture capitalist Jim Barksdale made the point that the bundling-unbundling continuum serves as a kind of schematic template for just about every business process. As he said, ""There's only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling.""

To illustrate Barksdale's point, we can observe that computers started out, in the mid-20th century, as bundled; that is, IBM bundled both hardware and software into its computers. Then came Microsoft, which unbundled: you would buy your computer hardware from, say, Dell, but you would buy your software from Bill Gates.

Meanwhile, there was Apple, which had always insisted on bundling its hardware and software into a proprietary closed system. Then Apple chose to unbundle. It developed the iPhone, including the App Store, which was unbundling to the max -- and thereby opened itself up to thousands, even millions, of companies, each with its own software that could be loaded onto a smartphone.

Indeed, we can apply Barksdale's concept of bundling and unbundling to just about everything in business. At any given time, companies and industries are either consolidating or unconsolidating, gobbling up or spinning off. It's a process right out of Ecclesiastes: ""To every thing there is a season...a time to break down, and a time to build up.""

Thus there can never be a right answer to the bundling-unbundling question; it's better thought of as a never-ending game of leapfrog. One moment, the bundlers are in the ascendancy; the next, the unbundlers have the edge.

So now to politics, which sees the same back-and-forth. In the sub-world of campaign finance, ""bundlers"" are well known as those fundraisers who gather up campaign contributions and give them to candidates in bulk so as to maximize the impact -- and to maximize the credit given to the bundler.

Yet more broadly, political coalitions are also all about bundling and unbundling. For instance, once upon a time, the Democratic Party was an odd bundle of Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics. The issues dividing the two groups were profound, including Prohibition: the Southerners were mostly ""dry,"" while the Northerners were mostly ""wet."" About the only thing the two factions could agree upon was that they both liked the Republicans less. And so through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Democrats' improbable bundle stayed bundled.

Of course, one could make the same point about the old Republican Party: it was also a strange bedfellows bundle, including railroad tycoons and poor blacks.

Yet by the 1960s, the two political bundles were unbundling themselves. Broadly speaking, over the last half-century, the Old Right has become the New Left, while the Old Left has become the New Right. Thus, New England, once the citadel of Yankee Republicanism, is now the home of multicultural progressivism. And the working class precincts of the Midwest and South, the former heart of the New Deal, have gone Trumpy.

Once again, this process of bundling and unbundling is never-ending. Today's Democrats are a bundle that includes Wall Street, Silicon Valley, social justice warriors, and Washington Post-friendly neocons, while the GOP has bundled Christians, gun owners, libertarians, and populists.

Are either of these coalitions happy and stable? Of course not, although for the time being, at least, their revulsion at the other side is keeping them together.

Or should we say, mostly keeping together. In the 2018 elections, many suburbanites, long a key strand in the Republican bundle, chose to unbundle themselves from the GOP and bundle themselves to the Democrats. But will people in the 'burbs stay bundled to the Democrats even if, say, Bernie Sanders gets the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination? Or, to put the question another way, will moderate Democrats in Congress choose to unbundle themselves from national Democrats deemed too left-wing or otherwise extreme?

In the meantime, Republicans are making an effort at unbundling the other side and bundling up themselves. As this author has noted, in launching a new campaign to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide, the Trump administration is trying to loosen the allegiance of LGBTQs to the Democratic Party.

And we might point to another Republican opportunity: Asian Americans. Over the last few decades, they have been bundled -- seemingly as a matter of bureaucratic convenience by federal box checkers -- into the category of ""minority"" and from there to ""people of color."" And in fact, the vast majority of Asian-American elected officials are Democrats. Indeed, progressive strategists see Asians as a part of the majority-minority ""Coalition of the Ascendant.""

Yet is this bundling into the Democratic Party really the final word for Asian Americans?

One flashpoint issue is quotas in schools. By now it's become commonplace that elite colleges and universities discriminate against high-achieving Asian students. And it's becoming equally obvious that the same thing is happening in some K-12 systems.

Such discrimination is perhaps most notable in New York City, where leftist Mayor Bill DeBlasio has been working hard to undo the meritocratic excellence of selective public schools. And so Wai Wah Chin's March 2 op-ed in The New York Post, headlined ""The mayor's new scheme for top NYC schools is illegal and racist,"" might serve to unbundle some of those currently in the Democratic bundle.

Of course, in politics, there's no law that says that those who find themselves unbundled from one party must then bundle themselves into the other party. That is, it's always possible that the unbundled could form themselves into a new bundle -- a third party. That's what has happened recently in the United Kingdom, where a handful of disaffected Members of Parliament have unbundled themselves from both Labour and the Conservatives and bundled themselves into The Independent Group.

To be sure, such indie movements, on both sides of the Atlantic, tend to be short-lived: typically new party bundles are but a way-station on a particular group's migration from one extant bundle to the other. Yet still, every century or so, a new party does emerge, and such a volatile time as this has surely inspired unbundlers of all stripes.

Yes, whether it's the movies or politics -- or just about anything else, from religions to trade associations to garden clubs -- the bundlers and the unbundlers are always busy.

One likes to think that this never-ending process is a sign of progress -- although, of course, one can't always be sure.",565,The American Conservative,The Unbundling of America's Political Parties
"Pelosi says Democrats need to vote as one against GOP messaging

House Democrats are preparing to vote Friday on a sweeping ethics and campaign finance reform package known as the For the People Act, and in response the White House issued its second veto threat of the year on Tuesday, calling the proposal a reckless move that would increase opportunities for rampant voter fraud and chill free speech.

The bill, known as H.R. 1, purportedly aims to eliminate ""culture of corruption in Washington"" and to reduce the role of money in politics. It would make it easier for citizens to register and vote, tighten election security, and establish a small-donor public matching system in congressional elections.

In a direct shot at Trump, the bill would require presidents to release at least 10 years' worth of tax returns. The bill also would ban executive-branch officials from lobbying their old agency for two years after they leave government, and reauthorize and enhance the Office of Government Ethics, which has clashed with Trump.

Additionally, the Act would require groups like the Chamber of Commerce that spend more than $10,000 on political messaging to disclose the identity of their contributors who gave more than $10,000 -- prompting several business groups to raise concerns about their ability to communicate with politicians.

HOUSE DEMS RAMP UP EFFORT TO GET TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS, SETTING UP SEPARATION-OF-POWERS SHOWDOWN

""The $10,000 donor threshold appears designed to target business organizations while largely sparing labor organizations from disclosure of their funding sources, which are typically union dues that are far less than $10,000,"" Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group, told reporters on Tuesday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has long pronounced the reform measure dead on arrival in the Senate, where it faces long odds. And the White House, which has already vowed to veto the ongoing effort by Congress to strike down his national emergency declaration over border wall funding, issued a statement Tuesday outlining the administration's problems with the legislation.

""If H.R. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto the bill,"" the statement flatly concluded. Trump has not yet vetoed any legislation.

One of the measure's most notable provisions would restore protections included in the 1965 Voting Rights Act and guard against efforts by state officials to purge voting rolls.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, WHO CRITICIZES 'DARK MONEY' IN POLITICS, HIT WITH FEC COMPLAINT OVER UNUSUAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE SET-UP

Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a veteran of the civil rights movement, called voting ""the most powerful, non-violent instrument of transformation we have in our democracy,"" and said efforts to make it easier to vote -- not harder -- were crucial. ""I truly believe deep in my heart that the way votes were not counted and purged in Georgia and Florida and other states changed the outcome of the last election"" to harm Democrats, Lewis said. ""That must never happen again.""

""If H.R. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto the bill.""

-- White House statement

However, the White House said it saw that provision as an invitation to voter fraud.

""H.R. 1 would prohibit commonsense efforts to clean up voting-rolls to limit opportunities for voting fraud,"" the White House said. ""The bill would also require States to adopt online registration, same-day registration, and automatic voter registration, thus imposing a one-size-fits-all standard for weighing the competing values of voter access and voting integrity.""

The White House statement continued: ""Furthermore, H.R. 1 would enhance the powers of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Chairman and reduce the number of FEC members from six to five, thus increasing the chances that the FEC becomes a partisan entity with undue power to shape and regulate elections nationwide.""

Other objections raised by the Trump administration centered on the bill's advance of political redistricting mandates, as well as its possible effects on First Amendment rights.

In a move designed to reduce partisan gerrymandering, the bill calls for states to establish independent redistricting commissions to draw boundaries for future congressional districts.

""The legislation would force States to create unelected bodies and then delegate redistricting decisions to them,"" the White House's statement said in response. ""This would suppress the voices of our Nation's citizens and cut off a nationwide debate on how best to pursue fair and ethical redistricting processes throughout the country.""

Besides election provisions, the bill would set up a public financing system for House races and require political groups to disclose donors. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter would be required to disclose who paid for online ads, similar to existing rules for television and other media.

""H.R. 1 also chills free speech by creating requirements that would limit the ability of Americans to participate in advocacy without undue compliance costs and without fear of public reprisals,"" the White House countered. ""The bill would establish costly and unnecessary programs to finance political campaigns, and force American taxpayers to finance Federal candidates they may not support.""

But Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes said Democrats were ""responding directly to the American people and what they want to see in our democracy,"" as shown by the election results in the 2018 midterms.

Calling the bill ""transformative,"" Sarbanes said in January it will ""strengthen our democracy and return political power to the people by making it easier, not harder, to vote, ending the dominance of big money in our politics and ensuring that public officials actually serve the public.""

""You could stamp on this thing 'McConnell-rejected,' and it would immediately give it more credibility,"" Sarbanes said. The legislation was not built for McConnell or any lawmaker, Sarbanes added: ""This was built for the public.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also touted the bill, saying it would ""restore integrity to government, so that people can have confidence that government works for the public interest, not the special interests.""

On ethics, members of Congress would be barred from serving on corporate boards and could not use taxpayer dollars to settle employment discrimination cases. But the White House argued that those provisions would unnecessarily impede the work of the executive branch with burdensome regulations.

Sarbanes and other supporters said the election security measures are particularly important as the 2020 election nears.

Predicting ""historic turnout"" in upcoming elections, Sarbanes said officials must not only encourage increased participation, but guard against attempts at sabotage from foreign and domestic adversaries.

""If we're not ready for that in all the ways [the legislation] seeks to ensure, then we could end up with a train wreck,"" he said.",566,Fox News,"Trump threatens veto as House Dems ready sweeping campaign finance, ethics package"
"Sen. Warner: I've never seen this many contacts between a campaign and a foreign power

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., doubled-down Tuesday on his previous assertions that there's a significant quantity of evidence tying the Trump campaign to Russia, while also vowing to ""reserve judgment"" until ""all the facts come out.""

During an interview on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" Warner - the top Democrat of the Senate Intelligence Committee - explained that he thinks the public can reach their own determinations by examining information that ""is already in the public domain.""

""We know based upon Michael Cohen's testimony last week that President Trump knew about and was negotiating with the Russians well past when he announced his campaign, well into the primary season in 2016,"" Warner said. ""We know that there was at least some indication that he, Trump, knew about the potential leakage of all the DNC materials from WikiLeaks, literally days before it was released. We know that Paul Manafort, the president's campaign manager, turned over information to them, a Russian agent, in terms of campaign data.""

MARK WARNER SAYS THERE'S 'ENORMOUS' EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA-TRUMP COLLUSION

The Virginia lawmaker went on to note what he viewed to be an extensive amount of ties between Trump's team and Russia.

""I've been around politics a long time,"" he said. ""I've never seen this many contacts between a campaign and the candidate's business organization and a foreign power.""

Warner more than once questioned why Trump's team did certain things but insisted he would keep an open mind until all the facts were presented.

MANAFORT HEALTH WOES NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO REDUCE SENTENCE, MUELLER ARGUES

""Why would the president's campaign manager give secret campaign documents to a Russian agent?"" Warner said. ""Again, Martha, I'm reserving judgment. What I've said throughout this, throughout this whole investigation, I said I'm going to reserve judgment until every, all the truth and all the facts come out. But in terms of just what is factually out there, you can potentially reach a different conclusion. I'm going to reach my conclusion when all the facts come out but these facts are fairly indisputable.""

While Warner is eager for the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into the 2016 presidential election to be finished, he said there are multiple ""key individuals"" they still need to speak to. And when the probe will be completed is at least partially dependent on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, he added.

""Well, in a lot of ways that will depend on when Mueller finishes the legal proceedings against some of the key witnesses that need to see,"" Warner said. ""I want this to be done. I want the American people to know what our conclusions are. And I want to make sure that no foreign power ever intervenes in our elections again.""

"National Day of Empathy raises awareness for people affected by the criminal justice system

Actor David Arquette and his wife, TV personality Christina McLarty Arquette, were among a crowd of activists in Arkansas on Tuesday calling for lawmakers to implement criminal justice reform laws like the ones President Trump signed into law in December.

""People that are re-entering society, we want them to have a fair shake,"" David Arquette told The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. ""We want to end the dismantling of communities.""

Protesters rallied at the Arkansas Capitol against what they've called unjust criminal justice laws, encouraging lawmakers to consider reforms. Tuesday's protests were part of a national ""Day of Empathy"" organized by #cut50, a national bipartisan initiative to reform criminal justice. The goal is to generate empathy for those affected in some way by the criminal justice system.

Tuesday marks the event's third year.

""Politics aside, this is a bipartisan issue,"" McLarty Arquette, an Arkansas native, told the Arkansas newspaper. ""This is an issue about human beings on the level of, like, loving each other and kindness.""

"Former Vice President Joe Biden is still contemplating a run for President in 2020, but it appears that if Huffington Post has its way, Joe will fade off into history instead of riding a wave of Democrat votes into the White House.

With its lead story for March 5, Huffington Post pounded Barack Obama's vice president for being a ""champion"" of policies ""favored by Republicans and the corporate elite.""

The article by HuffPo's Zach Carter makes note of ""Middle-Class Joe's"" efforts to position himself as the populist choice of average, work-a-day Americans, and the kind of Democrat ""you could have a beer with.""

But Huffington Post does not want anyone misled by Biden's folksy veneer:

This version of ""folksy Joe"" even touted himself as ""labor from belt buckle to shoe buckle."" There's only one problem with this carefully cultivated image: Joe Biden's entire career.

The liberal site insists that Biden's entire 40 years in government has been spent working to the opposite ends of his folksy reputation:

In more than four decades of public service, Biden has enthusiastically championed policies favored by financial elites, forging alliances with Wall Street and the political right to notch legislative victories that ran counter to the populist ideas that now animate his party. If he declares for the presidency, Biden will face a Democratic electorate that has moved on from his brand of politics.

HuffPo goes on to cite several examples of Biden's work in favor of big money. The article cites a 1979 fight between Biden and Sen. Td Kennedy where Biden supported big money corporations over Kennedy's hopes to limit the growth of corporations. And then there was Biden's effort to scuttle Democrat plans to alter anti-trust laws to make it easier for consumers to sue big corporations.

The article even dredged up a Biden quote where he commented favorably about ""voting conservative.""

""A lot of us sit around thinking up ways to vote conservative just so we don't come out with a liberal rating,"" Biden told Washingtonian in 1974. ""When it comes to civil rights and civil liberties, I'm a liberal, but that's it. I'm really quite conservative on most other issues.""

Biden was routinely marked in low numbers by groups that rated Congress for its ideological leanings, HuffPo reminds readers.

Of course, this was in the day when the ""new"" Democrats were positioning themselves as good, old fashioned, Blue Dogs, and not liberal elites. Remember, even Bill Clinton ran for the White House in 1992 as a ""new Democrat,"" a supposedly fiscally responsible, conservative Democrat.

HuffPo lists more of Biden's ""conservative"" votes:

He voted for a landmark Reagan tax bill that slashed the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent and exempted many wealthy families from the estate tax on unearned inheritances, a measure that cost the federal government an estimated $83 billion in annual revenue. He then called for a spending freeze on Social Security in order to reduce the deficits that tax law helped to create.

""By the time Biden first ran for president in 1987, he had adopted much of Reagan's anti-government message in his pitch to Democratic voters,"" Carter writes disapprovingly.

Biden's 1987 plagiarism scandal received a brief mention, as well: ""Biden dropped out of the 1988 presidential race after just a few months, unable to deal with a speechwriting plagiarism scandal that today seems quaint.""

Carter didn't elaborate, but the incident was very embarrassing for Biden at the time. He was caught lifting a segment from a speech British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock delivered only four months prior to the 1988 U.S. election cycle.

But that incident also came on the heels of questions over plagiarism indulged when Biden was in college, charges he eventually admitted to perpetrating. He tried to explain it away saying his college plagiarism ""wasn't malevolent."" But piled on top of his speech controversy, the charges were too much for him to over come.

Even as he bowed out of the 1988 run for the White House, HuffPo notes that Biden was a strong advocate of Clinton's fiscally conservative policy ideas. ""Biden was a steadfast supporter of an economic agenda that caused economic inequality to skyrocket during the Clinton years,"" Carter wrote.

The HuffPo assault on Biden's liberal bona fides went on with charges that the former VP supported a long list of policies that benefitted ""the rich.""

Carter also noted that as Obama's VP, Biden worked with Republicans to implement cuts to Social Security in exchange for but small tax hikes on the rich.

In summation, HuffPo's Carter slams Joe as a sham candidate who is illegitimately presenting himself as a liberal champion for the common man.

Biden's regular Joe credibility is based entirely on his personal background, as someone who grew up working class and speaks with the rough masculinity that Washington interprets as authenticity. But his politics have always relied on elite assumptions about the economy: Deficits are bad, deregulation is smart, and the government is at best a clumsy steward of economic prosperity.

Of course, Biden has a long history of imagining himself as the next president.

As mentioned above, Biden ran a disastrous campaign in 1988 when he was derailed and bowed out early after those plagiarism charges.

But the former Senator from Delaware has floated himself as a candidate for president or actually started a campaign in nearly every presidential election since 1988. He launched a second serious bid in 2008, facing down then-Sen. Barack Obama, but bowed out early again when he was not able to win enough primary voters to knock Obama out of the race. Biden garnered only one percent in the Iowa caucuses in 2008, and in all his attempts to run for the White House, he has never come close to winning the Democrat primaries. And he is at it again.

Not one person out of the group of six Democrats decided to raise their hand, according to the video provided by CNN's New Day.

The Democrats surveyed by CNN at the news station's New York City bureau said they did not support Biden because they wanted a Democrat candidate with a more ""progressive"" bent.

""I think we need a bold, strong leadership, and you'll find that in the progressives,"" One potential Democrat voter, Carol Evans, said.

""We had the standard-bearer for the kind of pragmatic centrist candidate in Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Donald Trump is now president. He is not your average political candidate, so we really need to try to think outside the box because, you know, it seems like the dude is made of rubber.

""I don't think Joe Biden represents that new thing that we need. We need a new economy, we need new politics and we need someone different,"" Democrat Owen Evans added.

The CNN focus group is not the first to take aim at Biden. The Huffington Post criticized Biden on Wednesday for promoting policies favored by ""the corporate elite.""

Although Biden has taken the lead among 2020 Democrats in recent polls, he may have to answer to some explosive revelations that may cause his critics to sour on him even more, including a $1.5 billion deal he and his son Hunter made with the Chinese government-backed Bank of China.

Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer, in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, detailed how Biden may have helped Hunter secure the $1.5 billion deal with a China-based investment firm that had ties to a Chinese atomic energy company indicted for ""nuclear power conspiracy against the United States.""",570,Breitbart,VIDEO: CNN Focus Group Rejects Joe Biden as 2020 Candidate

"The meticulous arrangements had all been made for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez to tour their potential dream house in the Bel-Air section of southern California.

After separately slipping into Sanchez's flatbed truck at the Burbank airport, the gates to the glittering, $88-million home with rooftop garden were to swing open at the exact moment they pulled up, to eliminate any chance that the Amazon founder and his girlfriend might be spotted by paparazzi. That plan was marred by a three-minute delay at the gate, and Lauren's brother Michael, who Bezos had tapped to run the housing search, had to get out and arrange for it to be opened.

The mission had almost been aborted by the realization that one member of the real estate team had failed to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which was texted by an executive while they were in the car (""don't want any drama or distractions,"" she said). Once inside, an agent breached a detailed agreement not to speak to the mystery house-hunters by trying to shake hands with them before he was whisked away.

Bezos and Lauren Sanchez spent nearly an hour touring the three levels, nine bedrooms, 15 baths, home theater, art studio, wine cellar and spectacular patio with sweeping views of the Los Angeles basin and distant skyline. They enjoyed a romantic moment as they lingered at the circular sauna.

HOW AMAZON'S JEFF BEZOS AND THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER WENT TO WAR

It was Dec. 22, and the world did not yet know of the romance between Bezos and Sanchez, a television personality, that would explode into public view with a National Enquirer expose in early January.

But the secret search underscored that this was no casual fling. The world's richest man and his girlfriend had told their spouses that they wanted to leave their marriages, and they were starting to plan a life together. Only those closest to the couple knew how serious they were about the future.

Much of the coverage of Bezos and Sanchez has focused on the lurid aspects, including the steamy texts and naked pictures obtained by the supermarket tabloid. There has also been a sharp focus on the impact on Amazon, since Bezos' wife MacKenzie will likely receive a substantial part of his fortune, and possibly on his other brand-name property, the Washington Post.

All but lost in the blur -- including Bezos' charge that the Enquirer was engaged in blackmail, vehemently denied by its parent company American Media Inc. -- are the risks the couple took to be together.

They were tempted by the home at 822 Sarbonne Road, which Lauren Sanchez had spotted in Forbes magazine. They considered buying the $10-million property next door, from the same developer, for a guest house and greater security. But the couple ultimately passed on the purchase, concluding that the house was too big, and besides, Bezos didn't like the raised swimming pool.

AMAZON, LONG SEEN AS A THREAT TO MALLS, IS NOW A HOT TENANT

The search continued through early January, with Michael Sanchez inspecting properties and checking on when Bezos would be in town and might join his sister in taking a clandestine look.

That search included a newly built mansion in the same neighborhood at 924 Bel-Air Road, with 12 bedrooms, 21 bathrooms, three kitchens, six bars and a fake helicopter on the lawn. Its price tag--$250 million, including $30 million in luxury cars -- made it the most expensive home in America. The tour opened with servants carrying food and Champagne, but the couple passed on it after Michael Sanchez briefed them.

As a practical matter, the Seattle-based CEO needed a place to live with Sanchez, who works in L.A., because Mackenzie Bezos is expected to receive the home they own in Beverly Hills. But privacy concerns were even more paramount.

Gavin de Becker, the billionaire's longtime security consultant, had told Bezos that he couldn't date, that they couldn't find a hotel or restaurant that would be secret enough. Lauren Sanchez was concerned about that warning. A private, high-security home would solve the problem.

De Becker declined to comment, but has privately maintained that he never had any such discussion with Bezos, that such advice would be ridiculous and his clients dine out all the time.

In any event the couple was occasionally spotted in public places while their relationship wasn't publicly known, including at the launch of Bezos' Blue Origin aerospace company, for which Lauren's production firm did some work.

A press representatives Lauren Sanchez declined to comment. An Amazon spokesman also had no comment.

SOURCE OF LEAKED BEZOS TEXTS WAS MISTRESS' PRO-TRUMP BROTHER: REPORT

Michael Sanchez, a Hollywood talent handler who has been Lauren's manager on and off for years, has been publicly feuding with de Becker.

On Feb. 14, Sanchez wrote to Bezos: ""I've tried desperately to get you and Lauren to wake up...Gavin has brilliantly set you and I up, with the clear goal of destroying your love for my sister...I know the truth about your love for Lauren and her love for you...

""Ask yourself one question: Why in the hell would I do anything to hurt you and Lauren, two people I love and I know are completely in love? Money? Politics? Power? No way. Period.""

That email, portions of which were first reported by the New York Times, highlights the degree to which the controversy has put Michael Sanchez on the defensive, and how his relationship with both Bezos and his sister has been strained.

De Becker has told Michael Sanchez that his theory is absurd and he has no interest in keeping the couple apart.

Unnamed sources have alleged to some news outlets that Michael Sanchez was the person who provided evidence of the affair to the Enquirer, with Vanity Fair quoting one anonymous source as saying he was paid $250,000 for the material.

Sanchez has said he never provided to the Enquirer, and never had access to, what the tabloid described as ""below-the-belt selfies"" of Bezos. He has declined to go beyond that denial.

""I didn't dignify any of the false allegations, and I'm not going to start dignifying anonymous sources and false leaks today,"" Michael Sanchez told me. ""I'm not going to comment on baseless lies and half-truths. Everything I did since April 20, 2018, the day I met Jeff, has been to protect Jeff and Lauren. Once I heard rumors that outlets were onto the case, I did everything in my power to delay the inevitable scandal.""

"This blog shows you how to stare into the abyss without spilling your drink (Louis Cuthbert/Shutterstock)

It often happens that when I got out into the real world to give a speech, some devout reader of this blog will come up to me and ask, ""Is Uncle Chuckie for real?"" And I respond with the truth: He's not only real, he's hyperreal.

Personally, I question whether or not Uncle Chuckie has proper theology and geometry (if Ignatius Reilly and Aleister Crowley had a gayby, he would be a lot like Chuckie), but there can be no doubt that he is a beloved curmudgeon who is a stalwart presence on this blog written and administered by a conservative Christian eclecticist who has a soft spot for eccentrics. I am the kind of conservative who stands on the rooftops to shout out what Russell Kirk said here:

""I did not love cold harmony and perfect regularity of organization; what I sought was variety, mystery, tradition, the venerable, the awful. I despised sophisters and calculators; I was groping for faith, honor, and prescriptive loyalties. I would have given any number of neo-classical pediments for one poor battered gargoyle.""

If I ever win the Powerball lottery, I will sink part of my fortune into opening a pub called The Battered Gargoyle. I make that promise to you here and now.

I will also sink a greater part of my fortune into funding The American Conservative, the magazine that has been my home for the past eight years. I will do so out of gratitude, but also because I really and truly believe in the mission of this magazine. TAC is and always has been a shoestring operation that depends on the generosity of donors. When Pat Buchanan and Co. founded the magazine in 2002, to be a conservative voice against the Iraq War, they were going against almost everybody in the conservative movement -- and certainly against the donor class.

History has shown that they were right.

This doesn't mean TAC will always be right on every issue, of course, but what it shows is that this magazine exists as a voice on the Right questioning the mainstream GOP consensus, and providing a home for writers who speak their minds. I started here at TAC in the summer of 2011 with no readers, and just last month completed my first full year of having over one million unique visitors to this blog each month. In that entire time, I have not once been told by TAC's leadership what I can and cannot write -- this, even though there have been times when my words made trouble for them. As a writer, you cannot imagine how much this means. As a reader, well, I bet you can. It's why so many of you keep coming back. You will not get a party line here at TAC.

I'm not sure how many readers of this blog ever venture past it to read widely on the site. If you haven't done so, you're really missing out. I write about the things I care about most: the intersection of politics, religion, and culture, as well as a portmanteau of oddities: travel, food, woo-woo supernatural phenomenon, A Confederacy of Dunces, the South, politically correct wackadoodlery, and so forth. But you can read so many interesting and challenging things about foreign policy, economics, urbanism, pure politics, and the like on the magazine's main web page.

TAC is not just a smart magazine to read; it's also an incubator of ideas. We are playing a greater role in defining the next conservatism. David Brooks said that my book The Benedict Option was ""the most important religious book of the decade"" -- and the ideas in it were refined over the years on this blog. I think the one thing I'm most proud of is the role TAC played in helping to make J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy a national bestseller three years ago, and in encouraging reformist voices like his in the GOP. Vance is going to be the keynote speaker at TAC's big fundraising gala in May. I'm more than eager to hear his vision for a robust Main Street conservatism in the Trump (and post-Trump) era. Please come if you can!

Doing all of these things costs money. I remember when Rich Lowry invited me to come in for a job interview at National Review back in the autumn of 2001. I imagined that its offices would be oak-paneled and smelling faintly of sherry, as befitted a William F. Buckley operation. Ha! It was like visiting the offices of a shambling public interest law firm! That was my first introduction to the real world of publishing small magazines of ideas. Believe me when I tell you that every penny you donate to TAC goes into the magazine itself. There's more overhead under the belly of a cottonmouth stretched out in the mud than at TAC. I'm joking, but just barely. Ours is a lean, lean operation. You can be confident that anything you give to TAC goes straight to the production.

(I keep waiting for us to do a fundraising cruise. Maybe at one Walker Percy Weekend, we can take a bateau full of donors and an ice chest full of Abita up Bayou Sara to the low-water bridge and back).

Anyway, I know how much this blog and this magazine means to a lot of you, because you tell me with your words, and with your showing up every day to read and to comment. Won't you please show us a little love with your tax-deductible donation (TAC is a 501c3 organization)? Until I get rich enough to open the Battered Gargoyle pub, this is the best I can do to offer y'all a place to talk and laugh and to stare into the abyss without spilling your drink. The writing and the conversation is free, but bless y'all's hearts, we really could use a love offering. Donate today.

Now, as my love offering to you, I give you Charles ""Uncle Chuckie"" Cosimano and his helmet. You're welcome:",573,The American Conservative,Battered Gargoyle Conservatism
"On the roster: Stacey Abrams threatens presidential run - Hogan checks the temperature in Iowa - Ocasio-Cortez denies campaign cash allegations - McConnell can't protect Trump emergency - Florida man + Molotov cocktails = Kicker

STACEY ABRAMS THREATENS PRESIDENTIAL RUN

NYT: ""Pick a strategy Democrats are considering ahead of 2020, and Stacey Abrams's narrow loss in the Georgia governor's race serves either as a blueprint or a warning sign. ... For Ms. Abrams, the answer is unequivocal: Her campaign turned out record numbers of black, Latino and Asian voters, and she also won a larger share of the white vote than President Barack Obama or scions of Georgia political royalty like Jason Carter and Michelle Nunn. ... This, she argues, is a playbook Democrats should follow for 2020, whether or not she runs for president - a choice she is actively considering. 'I need women of color, particularly black women, to understand that our achievements should not be diminished,' she said, particularly that she came so close in a red state. She added, 'Now I'm not saying I would be the best candidate, but I'm not going to dismiss it out of hand the way others do.'""

Bloomberg pens op-ed, will not run in 2020 - Bloomberg: ""I know what it takes to run a winning campaign, and every day when I read the news, I grow more frustrated by the incompetence in the Oval Office. I know we can do better as a country. And I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election. But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field. There is another factor that has weighed heavily on my mind: the likelihood that our biggest national problems will worsen over the next two years. With a leader in the White House who refuses to bring the parties together, it will be nearly impossible for Congress to address the major challenges we face... I love our country too much to sit back and hope for the best as national problems get worse.""

Harris, Sanders got the best bounces - FiveThirtyEight: ""When candidates run for president, they want to make a good first impression. ... And so far, some candidates have had more successful kickoffs than others. ... Out of the six candidates for whom we have both before and after data, Sen. Kamala Harris appears to have had the best campaign launch so far. Harris gained 8 percentage points between the poll the week before her Jan. 21 announcement and the poll the week after. And horse-race polling wasn't the only indicator that Harris had an effective kickoff. Harris's announcement also succeeded at getting more voters to see her in a positive light. ... Sen. Bernie Sanders ... had nearly as big of a bump as Harris. Sanders gained 6 points between the Feb. 11-17 poll and last week's poll (he announced on Feb. 19). That's especially impressive considering that he was already a well-known commodity.""

Hillary finally gets Shermanesque - USA Today: ""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton definitively declared on Monday 'I'm not running' in the 2020 presidential election, again throwing cold water on the still smoldering rumors that she might go for a 2016 rematch against President Donald Trump. 'I'm not running, but I'm going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,' she said in an interview with News 12, a regional cable news network in New York. 'I'm not going anywhere.' Clinton has been an outspoken critic of her 2016 opponent and his administration's policies since her defeat.""

Bernie signs Democratic loyalty pledge - WaPo: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), a longtime independent, signed a pledge Tuesday saying he would seek the presidency as a Democrat and govern as a Democrat if elected. The move comes in response to a new rule from the Democratic National Committee that requires all candidates for the party's 2020 presidential nomination to sign such a pledge -- a change that some Sanders allies considered a swipe at the senator. Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and has said he will support the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 no matter how the nominating contests go, has frustrated some in the party by remaining politically independent. He ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 but then sought reelection to his Senate seat from Vermont last year as an independent.""

Merkley's message for Dems: There's more at stake than the presidency - AP: ""U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon has decided not to enter the increasingly crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination after months of consideration. Merkley told The Associated Press the large field of Democratic contenders for the White House was not a major factor in his decision, nor was an Oregon law that prevents him from being on the ballot for more than one elected office in any given year. 'I've never shied from a fight, and there's nothing about the field that would make me reluctant to be there,' Merkley said. Merkley, who planned to formally announce his intentions on Tuesday, said in a telephone interview that he decided he would be more effective running for his third term in the Senate than being a candidate for the presidency.""

Beto the blank slate - Politico: ""It might be the biggest question lingering over [Beto] O'Rourke as he prepares for a likely run for the Democratic presidential nomination: Just what does he believe, actually? O'Rourke seems unwilling to place himself on his party's conventional political spectrum. At the final town hall of his congressional career, the last of more than 100 such gatherings he held, O'Rourke was greeted in December at a local high school by cheerleaders, a mariachi band and supporters wearing T-shirts reading 'Beto for President.' In response to a question from POLITICO after the event, O'Rourke would not -- or could not -- answer if he considers himself a progressive Democrat. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I'm just, as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign, I'm not big on labels. I don't get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. I'm for everyone.'""

Caitlin Flanagan: 'The anger of Amy Klobuchar' - The Atlantic: ""What a disappointment all of this has been to those of us who had been so excited by [Amy] Klobuchar when we were introduced to her during the sudden-death round of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. You can be forgiven for not remembering those hearings, as they took place several years ago, before (inter alia) the Cohen testimony, the government shutdown, Caravans I, II, and III, Jussie Smollett, the state of emergency, people 'unwilling to work,' Virginia Is for Racists, Donald Trump breaking his 40-year winning streak of staying out of Vietnam, and the Oscars' celebration of diversity coming to an abrupt halt when the wrong diversity picture got celebrated.""

HOGAN CHECKS THE TEMPERATURE IN IOWA

WaPo: ""Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of the highest-profile Republicans open to running against President Trump, sounded notes Monday that candidates-in-waiting have long tried to hit in this first-caucus state. But he also signaled that he is in no rush to make up his mind about 2020. He said he was here to attend to National Governors Association business, not lay the groundwork for a campaign. 'It currently makes no sense, with a president that has the kind of approval rating that he does in his own party,' Hogan said in an interview. 'Having said that, I've said things can change, and we don't know what it might look like a few months from now.' Variables such as the outcome of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, Democratic talk of impeachment and the president's fluctuating political standing are all potential factors in his decision, Hogan acknowledged. In the meantime, he's taking things slowly.""

Mark Cuban keeping his 2020 options open - Fox News: ""Mark Cuban won't rule out taking a shot in 2020. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner told Fox News it isn't a slam dunk that he will get in the race, but it is something he is considering. 'I said I'm not ruling it out,' Cuban said via email. 'But the tea leaves would have to align perfectly.' The comments came after the 'Shark Tank' star spoke to the New York Daily News following the Mavs game against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. When asked if he was going to get off the bench and enter the political game, Cuban said: 'I haven't decided anything yet. We'll see what happens. It all comes down to how things play out. There's a lot of uncertainty with what's going on with the Mueller report, there's a lot of things that have to be figured out before we know how 2020 is going to play out.'""

THE RULEBOOK: STILL TRUE TODAY

""No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity."" - James Madison, Federalist No. 10

TIME OUT: FASTELAVNBOLLERS FOR EVERYBODY!

Smithsonian: ""Fat Tuesday, Carnaval, Shrove Tuesday, Fasching, Fastelavn -- for as many different names there are for Mardi Gras, there's just as many food-related traditions. Famous in the United States, of course, are king cake and beignets in New Orleans. Shrove Tuesday in Great Britain consists of a pancake feast. Fat Tuesday is on a Thursday in Poland, but their deep-fried treasure pƒÖczki is so renowned some just call it PƒÖczki Day. Topped with powdered sugar, pƒÖczki are crispy on the outside and soft and thick in the middle with delicious jelly filling. Other countries have similar treats by different names. Lithuanians have spurgos, which are pretty similar -- with the exception that they're sometimes made with rum and raisins, or other times with cottage cheese. The Portuguese have malasadas, typically unfilled, but very sugary, balls sometimes formed into a unique triangular shape. Scandinavians, meanwhile, enjoy semla, or fastelavnboller, which are cream-filled baked buns.""

OCASIO-CORTEZ DENIES CAMPAIGN CASH ALLEGATIONS

Fox News: ""New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday denied violating federal campaign law after a conservative government watchdog filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing the Democratic lawmaker and her chief of staff of being part of an 'off-the-books operation' to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on candidates last year. 'There is no violation,' Ocasio-Cortez exclusively told Fox News after landing Tuesday at Ronald Reagan National Airport. ... The complaint was drafted by the Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center. It accuses Ocasio-Cortez and Saikat Chakrabarti, her chief of staff, of funneling nearly $1 million in contributions from political action committees Chakrabarti established to private companies that he also controlled. The funds, the NLPC writes, were likely spent on campaign events for Ocasio-Cortez and other far-left Democratic candidates favored by Chakrabarti, who made his fortune in Silicon Valley and previously worked on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. ... Chakrabarti did not return a request for comment.""

Ocasio-Cortez says critics stoking violence against her - New Yorker: ""'It feels like an extra job,' [Ocasio-Cortez] said of the attacks. 'I've got a full-time job in Congress and then I moonlight as America's greatest villain, or as the new hope. And it's pretty tiring. I'm just a normal person. I knew that I was not going to be liked. I'm a Democrat. I'm a woman. I'm a young woman. A Latina. And I'm a liberal, a D.S.A. member,' she said, referring to the Democratic Socialists of America. 'I believe health care is a right and people should be paid enough to live. Those are offensive values to them. But this ravenous hysteria -- it's really getting to a level that is kind of out of control. It's dangerous and even scary. I have days when it seems some people want to stoke just enough of it to have just enough plausible deniability if something happens to me.'""

House Dem in row over anti-Semitism resolution - NYT: ""The decision by House Democratic leaders to put a resolution condemning anti-Semitism on the House floor Wednesday has touched off a furious debate between older House Democrats and a new breed of young liberal activists over whether Representative Ilhan Omar is being singled out for disparate treatment. The issue is pitting veteran Democrats like Representatives Eliot L. Engel, Nita M. Lowey and Jerrold Nadler -- all of whom lead major House committees, and all of whom are Jewish -- against Ms. Omar and left-leaning groups like Justice Democrats and IfNotNow, a movement led by young Jews to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. It was prompted by comments and tweets from Ms. Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, that were characterized as anti-Semitic. A draft of the resolution being circulated on Capitol Hill does not name Ms. Omar. But there is little question it is aimed at her.""

Jonathan Chait: 'Can anti-Semitism split Democrats like it split Labour?' - Intelligencer: ""Last week, Rachel Shabi, a left-of-center British journalist, warned American progressives that anti-Semitism could one day tear apart Democrats just as it is now doing to the Labour Party. When I read her essay, just ten days ago, it seemed fantastical. Today, after watching progressives floundering about in the wake of Ilhan Omar's smearing of pro-Israel activism as a form of dual loyalty, Shabi's diagnosis looks prescient. It can happen here.""

MCCONNELL CAN'T PROTECT TRUMP EMERGENCY

NYT: ""Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, conceded on Monday that he could not stave off final passage of a resolution overturning President Trump's national emergency declaration, setting up a rebuke to Mr. Trump amid signs that the president's grip even on his own party in Congress may be slipping. With Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky joining three other Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina -- in announcing he would support the measure, Democrats now have the 51 votes they need to secure passage and to force Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency. Mr. McConnell is exploring whether he can amend the House-passed resolution of disapproval, to send it back to the House and slow its trip to the president's desk. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski are both sponsors of a separate resolution, virtually identical to the House resolution, introduced in the Senate last week.""

Bon voyage, Stew - Politico: ""Don Stewart, who was for more than a dozen years a top communications adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is leaving the Hill after 22 years - all spent in the Senate. Stew, as he was known on the Hill, spent 13 years with McConnell, including his entire run as leader. He also worked for Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell and Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and John Cornyn. Stew was also a bouncer, and he was in the Army - two jobs that might actually prepare you to work on the Hill. His last day is next Friday.""

[Ed. note: Stew, as he is known on the Hill, is fairly well the ideal flack. He never lies, he tells you the facts in the light most favorable to his team but doesn't offer fanciful spin, he is well informed and has a presumption toward press access. He's been great to work with over the years. I wish him every success and happiness outside of the institution.]

Feud between Scott and Gaetz gets ugly - Politico: ""A feud between Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. Rick Scott has broken into the open, putting two of Donald Trump's closest Florida allies at war with each other in a state that's pivotal to the president's reelection campaign. After simmering behind the scenes for months, the conflict came to a boil when Scott accused Gaetz of witness intimidation for threatening Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer-turned-congressional-informant, via Twitter. ... The roots of the strife stretch back more than five years, to Tallahassee, when Scott served as governor. Back then, Gaetz was a state representative and Gaetz's father, Don Gaetz, was the president of the Florida Senate who clashed with Scott. Two years later, in 2016, Don Gaetz was passed over to become president of the University of West Florida after Scott lobbied the selection committee in favor of another applicant.""

FROM THE BLEACHERS

""I must admit to being conflicted. I want the wall built...national emergency, crisis, disaster...call it what you will, our southern border must be secured. Pelosi and crew absolutely disgust me with the political games they play with our national security and have forced President Trump to declare this national emergency to do what must be done. But...I'm a strong believer in our Constitution and the arguments I've heard that this declaration is a constitutional power overreach by the President are troubling. Also, if granted, it would set a precedent that could be abused in the future. Can you enlighten me as to what should be done and/or what you think will happen?"" - Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.

[Ed. note: In arguing against the resolution of disapproval now headed for passage in the Senate, President Trump said that Republicans should be unconcerned about the precedent it would set for future abuses of power by Democratic presidents since ""they're going to do it anyway."" But if that were so, it would be even more imperative for Republicans in Congress to hold the line now. The less this issue is about the specific policy and partisan self-interest, the better the legal argument Congress will have. There's a case to be made that the president's declaration is legal but not constitutional. And since there's never been a declaration like this one to repurpose domestic funds specifically, expressly denied by Congress on multiple occasions, there's a chance that the courts may consider the larger question of the law's validity. Either way, this is an important legal fight to have. And I think it's even more important that our impossibly weak Congress find ways to push back against the decades-long slouch toward executive power. That has nothing to do with my feelings about the issue of a couple of extra billion for border security, but rather about the deeper consideration of a system that's gotten out of whack.]

""Most interesting report. My wife and I have paw paw most days as a lunchtime dessert... delicious! My doctor father told me that paw paw seeds contained pepsin.

Not only do you live in a riotously, astonishingly beautiful place (current temperature, 88 degrees, steady breeze, low humidity) but you get to eat one of my favorite things in the world each and every day. Though as a West Virginian, perhaps I love paw paws so much because they are available so briefly. You have to wait until summer, when hot nights have finally crept into the mountains. And before the first frost they are already gone. Maybe the waiting and the short season makes them taste sweeter. But if I had such easy access to ripe paw paws, I promise that I would keep my ice cream maker in overdrive churning out pints!]

FLORIDA MAN + MOLOTOV COCKTAILS = KICKER

WFTV: ""An Orange County [Fla.] man is under arrest after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at his own vehicle inside of an impound lot, according to an arrest report. 'He came back and started throwing gas cocktail bombs over the fence on his own car,' said car lot owner Darnell Adams. An arrest report says the suspect, Ayub Abdulrahman, came to get his car back after it was impounded and set it on fire instead. ... Adams said he was going to hand over the keys because Abdulrahman had already paid almost $300 to get this car out of the impound lot, but instead of it going home the burned-out car was stuck behind crime scene tape. ... 'I didn't even own it anymore. He was getting it out,' Adams said. '20 minutes. If he had waited twenty minutes, he would've been able to drive away in his car.' ... Adams said his mechanic was able to put the fire out with an extinguisher.""

"I'm old enough to remember when religious-liberty lawyers were a quirky, somewhat cool, and tiny (very tiny!) subset of the legal profession. They were the guys who'd skipped out on the law-firm bucks and instead spent their days making sure that the faithful folks on the fringes of American life didn't get a raw deal. They kept the dominant American cultural Christians honest.

Did a Native American group need the liberty to build a sweat lodge? Was a quirky home-school family getting harassed by state education officials? Did a Sikh need help to keep his dagger? In each case, the religious-liberties bar was there to help, and with broad public approval.

Few things symbolize the transformation of American politics more than the transformation of the religious-liberty dispute. Remember all the way back in 1993, when the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed with only three dissenting votes? It was introduced in the House by Chuck Schumer, in the Senate by Ted Kennedy. Bill Clinton signed it, with great fanfare. Now the very thought of introducing state versions of this federal legislation brings national condemnation, corporate boycotts, and media scorn.

In the early 1990s, you could almost fit the entire religious-liberties bar in a single mid-sized hotel conference room. Now conservative religious-liberties lawyers are the virtual Seal Team Six of the culture war, with multiple organizations raising collectively close to $200 million annually to do battle in courtrooms from coast to coast.

What changed? America changed from a largely single-faith culture to a two-faith nation -- sacred and secular -- and it will be a two-faith nation for the foreseeable future. That's why religious liberties are so controversial. That's why they'll be a flashpoint in 2020 and in 2024. No longer is a Christian nation urged to protect the small and politically insignificant faiths in its midst. In 1993, there was no real perceived public cost to basic religious tolerance. Now, the Sunnis are asked to tolerate the Shiites. The Hindus are asked to tolerate the Muslims. And in the zero-sum game of two-faith power struggle, when one faith wins, the other takes a loss.

In an invaluable piece in today's New York Times, Ross Douthat makes an important point about American politics. While Democrats are divided between left and center-left on a broad range of policies, when it comes to the culture war, there is no meaningful center-left. Here's Douthat:

The story of the Democrats' struggles over the last 15 years is a story of a party that has consistently moved leftward faster than the also-changing country, and consistently overread victories -- on same-sex marriage above all -- as a template for how every cultural battle should play out. It's a story of a new feminism that's pushing the party ever-further from the center on abortion, of a new cohort of white liberals who are actually to the left of many African-Americans on racial issues, of an activist base that brands positions that many liberals held only yesterday as not only mistaken but bigoted or racist or beyond-the-pale.

Consider Hillary Clinton, for example. I wrote not long ago that if the 2016 version of Hillary ran in 2020, she'd anchor the far-right wing of the Democratic primary. Her health, climate, and foreign policies are all well to the right of the Democrats today. But not on cultural issues. On cultural issues she was lockstep with the white progressive Left -- dismissive of religious freedom, fully on board with the Obama administration's gender-identity initiatives, and even seeking public funding of abortions.

Ross calls this modern liberalism a ""pseudo-church."" Increasingly, however, we can drop the ""pseudo."" As Andrew Sullivan and many others have been arguing for some time, the language and practice of secular intersectionality directly compares with multiple elements of classic religious belief -- from original sin (privilege), to justification (becoming woke), to sanctification (being an ally). But the secular nature of this religion leads many progressives to believe it can fully inhabit government, the academy, and corporate America without constitutional or legal consequence. True enough, under American law you can preach each aspect of the social-justice faith from the government pulpit in a way that you can't preach the divinity of Christ, but social justice cannot crowd religion from the public square.

Identifying intersectionality and the secular focus on social justice as fundamentally religious impulses helps us identify the magnitude of our national polarization. The adoption of these religious impulses even by the center-left helps us understand why the stakes of our political contests always seem to rise. This is a sobering idea, because -- let's face facts -- present world realities and enduring examples from history teach us that true two-faith nations often struggle mightily to maintain social peace and political cohesion absent extraordinary efforts to maintain unity and comity.

Tolerance is easy when tolerance doesn't threaten your power. A nation secure in its identity can and should unite to protect marginalized and politically weak religious voices, and in 1993 it did exactly that. A nation torn by religious division, by contrast, will view each advance by a religious foe as a material defeat of religious friends. Unless we can break that paradigm, look for the American divide to widen all the more.",575,nationalreview.com,Two-Faith Nation: America's New Identity
"The Netflix lemmings howl as the legendary director prepares to take a stand for cinema.

Hysteria has erupted over Steven Spielberg's intent to challenge the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences's practice of giving its Oscar awards to live-streaming content rather than movies. The Internet is crazily enraged that Hollywood's youngest titan hasn't bowed down to the latest mode of content delivery like everybody else.

Few people can think for themselves these days and pop-culture consumption is one of the most pathetic examples of the public rendered susceptible to media suasion. This is the same non-analytical, TV-loving mania as left-wing journalists blaming themselves for promoting President Trump's election, the same irrational conception of media's impact. The anti-Spielberg protests are ridiculous first of all because Spielberg hasn't even made his statement yet. Why have the Inter-Webs jumped the shark?

Spielberg's recent box-office flops lost him cultural clout, especially with those who easily fall for the latest trends. Spielberg's earlier pronouncement on what's artistically distinctive about theatrical cinema dared to oppose the speciously labeled ""Golden Age of Television."" He has riled the lemmings who gave in to binge-watching (what academics call ""corporate autism"") and devoted themselves to cable presentations. They don't appreciate the heightened visual and sensual awareness that makes Spielberg's particular art form -- the cinema -- special.

I have not been a fan of Spielberg's recent politically influenced films (Lincoln, Bridge of Spies, The B.F.G., Ready Player One), so it surprises me that he appears to be going against the progressive mob. But Spielberg's plan to address the Academy's Board of Governors (of which he is the most prestigious member) and propose changing the awards criteria indicates that he has beliefs that go deeper than populist politics. The anticipated articulation of these beliefs (that cinema, unlike television, is an irreducible, visually kinetic art form and is inseparable from the mass human experience) reminds true Spielberg fans that some spark of artistic valor still remains.

Maybe Spielberg can no longer woo ticket buyers in the vast numbers he once did, but he seems to have found some testicular fortitude.

Could this be Spielberg's proudest moment? It nearly makes up for his succumbing to stupid political correctness in 1997, when the Directors Guild of America chose to remove D.W. Griffith's name from its awards, thus betraying the movie pioneer Spielberg recalls at his best and to whom he, and all of us, are most indebted.

Spielberg may be ""on the wrong side of history,"" but that was always a specious axiom, favored by the dictator mentality of the previous administration that Spielberg, like many others, fell for from 2008 to 2016.

When Spielberg actually makes his Board of Governors appeal, his opponents may find that he fights for more than the organization's prestige. He cannot ignore that television and electronic media have beaten the movies in the popularity contest. But neither can the fact of cinema's kinetic, spatial essence be ignored. That essence has also lost popularity, degraded by aesthetically inert films like The Lord of the Rings series and any Marvel Comics blockbuster you can name, which I think is implicit in Spielberg's complaint.

The Academy's erratic protocol is obviously full of mishaps and contradictions. It has fallen for new-media trends and p.c. activism and ruined its former standards, as in the embarrassing case of ESPN's O.J.: Made in America TV series, which won Best Documentary Feature in 2016. But when the aesthetics of film presentation are forgotten, so is the phenomenon of filmgoing, which once upon a time was literally, socially unifying. In the upcoming political-revolution epic Peterloo, director Mike Leigh yearns for unity through an intense, fascinated concentration on faces and an emotional sweep that would be imperceptible on television or computer screens. (Peterloo is being released by Amazon Studios, a misnomer that pretends to Hollywood tradition while, actually, opposing it. At least Peterloo is experientially superior to anything so far released by Netflix.)

Movie-review shills never educate audiences about aesthetics. They simply provide hype, going along with the cultural collapse: Film = TV. If an egghead critic argues against this, the point gets dismissed. When Spielberg makes the point, even dummkopfs must pay attention.

Consumers who are suckers for the independent-movie trend are complaining that Spielberg is against them; they don't realize how few indie films keep the promise of Griffith, Eisenstein, Sternberg, Welles, Cocteau, Visconti, and Godard. They don't understand that Spielberg, for the first time in recent years, is thinking independently. They don't see that independent thinking is the rarest, most necessary attribute in this political era. Spielberg may be fighting a losing battle, but it's an honorable one.",576,nationalreview.com,Spielberg Recovers His Political Courage with Netflix Opposition
"As of right now, former Vice President Joe Biden is not only leading the field for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination by ten points, he is earning an average of 29 percent support in a field of 12.

In other words, nearly one in three Democrat primary voters support Biden.

Nonetheless, despite Biden's steady level of support, the far-left CNN put together a focus group where not one person in the group supported Biden.

This phony focus group consisted of exactly six people who were dragged out of bed to appear on CNN's failing morning show -- and I use the word ""phony"" with confidence because a focus group is supposed to represent a cross-section of people, and if CNN had been at all interested in presenting a cross-section using six measly people, at least two (according to the polls) would have expressed support for Biden.

""Biden rally comes from the good ole' boy politics of the past,"" said another.

A third genius, even though wages are rising, unemployment is historically low, and optimism is hitting record levels, said, ""I don't think Joe Biden represents that new thing that we need, we need a new economy.""

Yeah, a ""new economy,"" that's what we need.

Joining CNN in the war to discourage this 77-year-old white male from jumping into the primary is HuffPost, which is not as rabidly far-left as CNN, but in the same ballpark.

HuffPost's big, lead, banner story Tuesday is ""Joe Biden's Primary Problem [is] Joe Biden.""

The story is about 55 thousandmillion words that boil down to...

In more than four decades of public service, Biden has enthusiastically championed policies favored by financial elites, forging alliances with Wall Street and the political right to notch legislative victories that ran counter to the populist ideas that now animate his party. If he declares for the presidency, Biden will face a Democratic electorate that has moved on from his brand of politics.

...which means the title of the piece is not accurate. Biden's problem is not Biden; Biden's problem is that he is not left-wing enough for HuffPost, for the craziest crazies in the Democrat base.

The same is true of CNN. The problem is not that no one in that stupid focus group supports Biden, the problem is that CNN rigged the focus group so that no one would support Biden.

HuffPost is gaming the system out of the fear a more centrist Biden might win the nomination, which would mean the party is not as Ocasio-Crazy as HuffPost would like, and the race-obsessed CNN is smearing Biden as a ""good ole' boy"" in a phony focus group to pave the way for someone who is not an old, white male.

Hey, there's no upside for me to defend Biden. He is probably the guy with the best chance of defeating President Trump in 2020 (the state of the economy will matter most, though). The polls certainly say Biden has the best shot.

But this is worth pointing out because it is yet another example of how corrupt, dishonest, and manipulative the establishment media are, how desperate they are to meddle in the Democrat primary.

"In a Sunday New Yorker magazine profile, David Remnick read Ocasio-Cortez a quote from a Jezebel writer who said that in politics, ""women are often either characterized as hideous harpies like Hillary Clinton or pretty idiot whose 'craziness is bound up with their ex appeal."" Remnick pointed out that Ocasio-Cortez is ""firmly in the latter category.""

""I feel like I predicted it from day one,"" Ocasio-Cortez told Remnick. ""The idea that a woman can be as powerful as a man is something that our society can't deal with. But I am as powerful as a man and it drives them crazy.""

Mainstream media members like Remnick who never defended former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who had a strong record of reforming Alaska's government, when she was derided as a ""pretty idiot"" are now sympathizing with and coming to the defense of Ocasio-Cortez, who had no record of accomplishing reforms at any level before she became a national political figure.

Remnick allowed Ocasio-Cortez to add that dealing with the attacks, which she said are ""dangerous and even scary,"" ""feels like an extra job.""

""I've got a full-time job in Congress and then I moonlight as America's greatest villain, or as the new hope. And it's pretty tiring. I'm just a normal person. I knew that I was not going to be liked. I'm a Democrat. I'm a woman. I'm a young woman. A Latina. And I'm a liberal, a D.S.A. [Democratic Socialists of America] member,"" Ocasio-Cortez reportedly said. ""I believe health care is a right and people should be paid enough to live. Those are offensive values to them. But this ravenous hysteria -- it's really getting to a level that is kind of out of control. It's dangerous and even scary.

"During Tuesday's ""New Day"" on CNN, network political analyst John Avlon compared President Donald Trump's response to the deadly wildfires in California killing around 100 people in 2018 and Hurricane Maria killing around an estimated 3,000 to his response to Sunday's tornadoes that took at least 23 lives in Alabama.

Avlon wondered if Trump is playing ""partisan politics"" because his response to conservative Alabama's natural disaster was to help while he was critical of California and Puerto Rico to the point of being ""perilously close to blaming the victim.""

""So, what might make a president take a different instinctive tact towards Puerto Rico, California and the families in Lee County, Alabama?"" Avlon asked. ""Sad to say, but it just might be politics. Back in November, the Washington Post noted the stark differences in an article headlined, 'For Trump, Even Disaster Response Is Colored in Red and Blue.' Trump won Alabama by nearly two to one margin over Hillary Clinton, but lost California by almost the same margin. Bottom line: partisan politics shouldn't even cross a president's mind in the face of suffering by U.S. citizens.""

He continued, ""George W. Bush didn't exactly carry Manhattan, but he rallied around the city of New York after the attacks of 9/11. That's what president's do. That's why it's called acting presidential, and everyone should feel that the federal government has got their back when disaster strikes because it's moments like that when we should realize that no matter who you vote for, what divides us is small in the face of what unites us as Americans. And that's your reality check.""",579,Breitbart,CNN's Avlon Wonders if Trump Is Playing 'Partisan Politics' in Response to Alabama Tornadoes | Breitbart
"For the first -- and probably the last -- time in my life, I recently found myself identifying with Alice in Wonderland. Don't get me wrong. It wasn't a Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner moment. I was simply rearranging a few old volumes on one of the neglected upper shelves in my library. One of them, the collected works of Lewis Carroll, fell to the floor opened at the following passage:

The caterpillar and Alice looked at each other warily for some time in silence: at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. ""Who are you?"" said the caterpillar. ...Alice replied, rather shyly, ""I -- I hardly know, sir, just at present -- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.""

In this increasingly absurd era of identity politics, more and more Americans must be feeling the same way: ""Who am I?""

In my own case, depending on which angle you want to play, the answer could be WASP or Asian American; writer, editor, or public servant; conservative traditionalist or libertarian; Calvinist, Catholic, Armenian Monophysite, or Deist...and so on, ad nauseam.

Personally, I prefer ""American"" to any of the above because it is the only identity I know that is large enough and accepting enough to accommodate all of the often contradictory subsets that go into my biological, geographical, political, and spiritual heritage. Those include the grandson of Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire on my father's side and the descendant of 17th-century Virginian yeoman farmers and 19th-century Irish and German Catholic immigrants on my mother's side.

For census purposes I have always identified myself as a Caucasian American (Armenians being as Caucasian as my English, Irish, and German forebears, although their ancestral land was in Asia Minor). This stands in rather stark contrast to the present Congress where members of the new Democratic House majority have routinely identified themselves as Hispanic, Asian, Muslim, gay, bisexual, black, brown, yellow, and various shades of political pink.

It's all very divisive, and a shameful attempt to separate Americans by identifying them primarily by where their ancestors came from, their color or creed, or their behavior in bed -- none of which is anybody's business or is what goes into making an American.

It can also be incredibly misleading. Consider the designation ""Hispanic."" There is no such thing as a Hispanic race or a Hispanic nation. There are a large number of countries ranging from Spain itself to former Spanish colonies like Mexico, Central America, South America, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines where the Spanish language is widely spoken. But, depending on where they came from and which gene pool their ancestors drew on, today's so-called Hispanic Americans can be of Amerindian, Mestizo, African, mixed European, Jewish, or Asian ancestry. A few of them might even be Spanish. There is no ""raza"" in ""La Raza.""

We are -- uniquely -- a nation based on founding principles rather than tribal origins. That's why Yugoslavia dissolved in bloody chaos in less than a century while the United States has gone from strength to strength since 1776, accepting a wide variety of people as long as they embrace our shared values. America is a club, not a racial enclave, and it is open to all who are capable of appreciating -- and are willing to live by -- the club rules. It should never offer a free pass to those who sneak in the backdoor to become counter-culture squatters, often at great public expense.

Watching some of the multicultural -- and highly uncultured -- antics of Democratic ""freshpersons"" taking the congressional oath of office in January, some tossing in a few choice profanities along the way, it struck me that they had achieved something quite miraculous. They had actually made President Donald Trump's behavior seem dignified, tolerant, and a model of civility by comparison. I predict we will see more of this in the coming months with considerable damage to the Democratic brand.

It even has some liberal pundits worried, as reflected in a column written by The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne Jr. After citing a quote from Isaiah Berlin, ""Identities are not just things we have, they define who we are. We can compromise and balance interests. We cannot so easily adjust our identities,"" Dionne added, ""This is important to bear in mind, because political coalitions and democratic nations alike require a degree of solidarity rooted in our willingness to uphold each other's rights -- partly to protect our own rights but also to fashion a more just social order.""

That is what pre-identity crisis America has always managed to do. And it will probably happen again as more and more citizens are turned off by identity politics run amok in the new Congress. Meanwhile, as I suggested in a New Year's toast:

"Ocasio-Cortez is making a 'list' after moderate Dems side with Republicans

Moderate Democrats are fuming over New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's closed-door warning last week that Democrats who vote with Republicans are ""putting themselves on a list"" - a comment interpreted as a primary challenge threat.

Ocasio-Cortez has since downplayed her comments, made in the wake of 26 Democrats joining Republicans to vote for a provision requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be notified if illegal immigrants attempt to purchase guns.

OCASIO-CORTEZ WARNS OF 'LIST' FOR MODERATE DEMS WHO VOTE WITH REPUBLICANS

Still, some House Democrats aren't happy with her talk of a ""list.""

""I don't think it's productive,"" Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee said Saturday on Fox News' ""Cavuto Live.""

He added, ""I don't think we should be interfering with one another's politics. The people who elected us get to make those choices.""

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a co-chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus, said Ocasio-Cortez's use of the word ""list"" was ""Nixonian.""

""Being unified means ensuring that Democrats aren't primary-ing other sitting Democrats,"" Gottheimer told The Washington Post. ""Since when is it okay to put you on a Nixonian list? We need to have a big tent in our party or we won't keep the House or win the White House.""

The brouhaha began last week when two-dozen moderate Democrats broke from their party's progressive wing and sided with Republicans on a legislative amendment having to do with illegal immigrants and guns.

In a closed-door meeting afterward, according to The Washington Post, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scolded her wayward center-leaning colleagues, telling them: ""We are either a team or we're not.""

Ocasio-Cortez then told fellow Democrats that those who voted with Republicans were ""putting themselves on a list."" Ocasio-Cortez later claimed she wasn't talking about a list for primary challenges.

""I didn't say that they were putting themselves on a list for primaries,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""I said that by Dems distinguishing themselves by breaking off on procedural...votes, they were inadvertently making a list of targets for the GOP and for progressive advocates on their pro-ICE vote.""

Reacting to Ocasio-Cortez's comments, one party strategist who works for moderate Democrats argued Ocasio-Cortez doesn't ""respect"" the views of other Democrats who don't embrace her progressive politics.

""My main gripe about AOC is that while I respect her voice in the party, I don't think she respects mine or anyone else's who differs with her on policy or comes from a different political electoral reality,"" said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster in Alabama.

There's been speculation since she was elected to Congress that Ocasio-Cortez could get involved in Democratic primary fights in 2020, especially with the group Justice Democrats signaling plans to primary incumbent Democrats they see as insufficiently progressive. Ocasio-Cortez has been aligned with that group.

It's a tactic that has been embraced by some conservative groups and politicians on the right, especially during the 2010 and 2012 elections, when incumbent lawmakers in the House and Senate were ousted in primaries by conservative challengers.",581,Fox News,Moderate Dems fume over Ocasio-Cortez 'list' threat
"The term ""Duplassed"" comes from the actor Mark Duplass -- a talented actor and director who contacted me sometime last year, asking whether I could give him any guidance on the pro-Second Amendment position regarding gun control. I was happy to help; he showed up at our offices, where we spent an hour and a half chatting over the issue. As he left, I warned him that if he let his leftist friends know that we had met, he might face a backlash. He blithely assured me he wasn't worried.

A few months later, Duplass tweeted, ""Fellow liberals: If you are interested at all in 'crossing the aisle' you should consider following @benshapiro. I don't agree with him on much but he's a genuine person who once helped me for no other reason than to be nice. He doesn't bend the truth. His intentions are good.""

This, it turns out, was a rather large mistake. It prompted spasms of outrage from the Left, which brutally ratio-ed him on Twitter; Duplass quickly deleted his tweet, then issued a quasi-apology, calling his original tweet a ""disaster on many levels,"" adding that he ""in no way endorse[s] hatred, racism, homophobia, xenophobia or any form of intolerance.""

Being Duplassed sucks, to put it mildly. To have a person address you as a human being and acknowledge your basic good nature is inherently rather heart-warming. To have that judgment summarily rejected thanks to political blowback is just as stomach-churning. Suffice it to say, then, I have some sympathy for Vice President Mike Pence, who got Duplassed by former Vice President Joe Biden this week.

This week, Biden spoke in Omaha, Neb., where he called Mike Pence a ""decent guy."" This was, of course, a grave sin -- a sin so grave that radical-leftist actress and failed New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon chided Biden publicly. Nixon tweeted, ""@JoeBiden you've just called America's most anti-LGBT elected leader a 'decent guy.' Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community."" Most ridiculously, Nixon then tagged Biden's wife so that she could presumably shame her husband into compliance.

Whatever the rationale, Biden quickly complied. He tweeted, ""You're right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage. But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.""

Pence, in other words, didn't agree with Nixon; this made Pence a non-person. And Biden had to participate in Pence's un-personing in order to purchase an indulgence from Cynthia Nixon and her Wokescolds.

But the insanity didn't stop there. Nixon then published an op-ed in the Washington Post to press home the point: Pence was ""insidious,"" she wrote. She repeatedly mischaracterized Pence's record, suggesting that he ""signed a 'religious freedom' bill that would have allowed LGBTQ discrimination"" (false -- he actually called for changes to the bill to ""make it clear discrimination won't be allowed""); that he ""refused to lift a ban on needle exchange programs until a preventable HIV outbreak reached epidemic level"" (false -- he issued an executive order in March 2015 allowing distribution of needles while acknowledging public-health concerns about such distribution); that he ""suggested support for so-called conversion therapy"" (false -- there is no mention of conversion therapy on the website at issue); that he ""published an article urging businesses not to hire gay people"" (utterly false outright). Aside from all these false charges, Nixon condemned Pence as indecent for attempting to ""ban transgender people from military service,"" a position with which Pence has not been involved, and a position supported by a significant percentage of the population including a Department of Defense panel of experts; and seeking to ""define transgender Americans out of existence,"" a complete lie that mistakes recognizing biological sex differences for discrimination.

Nothing in Nixon's piece was newsworthy. It was simply a scurrilous attack on Pence for favoring traditional marriage (until 2012, the Democratic party agreed) and believing in religious sexual values. For this sin, the Washington Post went along with Nixon's attack on Pence's basic humanity.

Here's the truth: We have large-scale disagreements in this country. Very few of those disagreements are rooted in animus. By casting all disagreement as hate-based -- and by destroying those with whom we disagree on a character level -- we worsen both hate and politics. Enough with the Duplassing. Enough of the moral cowardice. It's just fine for Joe Biden to think Mike Pence is a decent guy. And it's pretty indecent to disagree.",582,nationalreview.com,"Joe Biden Calls Mike Pence a 'Decent Guy,' Gets Duplassed | National Review"
"Hillary Clinton smacked down months of speculation Monday about her launching yet another presidential bid in 2020.

The former first lady and Secretary of State revealed to News 12 Westchester her decision not to run against President Trump again after losing as the Democratic nominee to him in 2016.

""I'm not running, but I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,"" Clinton said.

The former New York senator also pledged to continue participating in the political conversation because the state of the country is ""deeply troubling"" and unprecedented.

""I want to be sure that people understand I'm going to keep speaking out,"" she continued. ""I'm not going anywhere. What's at stake in our country, the kind of things that are happening right now are deeply troubling to me.""

She also lamented the current polarization of political debate.

""And I'm also thinking hard about how do we start talking and listening to each other again?"" Clinton said. ""We've just gotten so polarized. We've gotten into really opposing camps unlike anything I've ever seen in my adult life.""

Although she is not running for president, Clinton said she plans to put her nose to the grindstone during the 2020 campaign season to help Democrats win back the White House.

""I've told every one of them, don't take anything for granted, even though we have a long list of real problems and broken promises from this administration that need to be highlighted,"" she said of the Democratic 2020 candidates. ""People need to understand that in many cases, they were sold a bill of goods. We can't take anything for granted. We have to work really, really hard to make our case to the American people, and I'm gonna do everything I can to help the Democrats win back the White House.""

Asked whether she would consider getting involved in local New York politics, such as a run for governor or New York City mayor, Clinton responded, ""I don't think so.""

""But I love living in New York and I'm so grateful that I had the chance to be a senator for eight years and to work with people across our state,"" she said. ""I care deeply about the future of New York and so, again, I'm gonna do what I can to help support candidates and causes that I think are continuing to make New York a better and better place.""

Bill and Hillary Clinton are facing fresh accusations of nepotism and revenge politics after a Democratic foreign policy adviser claimed they tried to obtain a scholarship for Chelsea Clinton's boyfriend, and later punished the adviser for backing then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008.

The Guardian reports that the allegations were made by Trina Vargo in a new book: ""Shenanigans: the U.S.-Ireland Relationship in Uncertain Times."" Vargo is the founder of the U.S-Ireland Alliance, a D.C.-based non-profit.

The controversy surrounded the Mitchell scholarship -- named after former Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who is credited with helping forge the 1998 Good Friday agreement -- which sends 12 students each year to study in Ireland and Northern Ireland.

But in the book, Vargo claims that in 2000, Mitchell told her that then-President Bill Clinton called him to say he was ""very unhappy"" that Chelsea's boyfriend was not on the shortlist for the grant -- despite a letter from the White House.

""It would be hard to believe that the timing of the president's call wasn't aimed at influencing us to make him a finalist,"" Vargo writes in the book, noting that the boyfriend still did not make it to the shortlist.

According to the Guardian, Vargo writes that she was later put on the path to joining the Clintons' ""enemies list"" -- a journey that was furthered when she advised Obama's campaign on Irish policy during his Democratic primary race against Hillary Clinton.

Vargo cites two incidents as part of the ""payback"" she alleges from the Clintons. The first was that Bill canceled his scheduled appearance at a U.S.-Ireland Alliance event in Belfast to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Good Friday agreement.

Vargo also claims that the State Department in 2012, when Hillary was secretary of state, cut its $500,000 funding to the Mitchell scholarship, citing budgetary measures -- but Vargo claims it was part of the ""payback.""

Representatives for the Clintons said that the accusations are ""patently false.""

"Prestige media outlets have gone extinct and given way to Buzzfeed.

We have seen an awful lot of change during the two years Trump has been president. American politics has been completely reordered, but also the American media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal just five years ago are now extinct -- some of them are totally forgotten. Those that remain have either degraded themselves beyond recognition, like The New Yorker, or they have been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for Amazon.com like the Washington Post.

It's hard to remember that not so long ago, America had prestige media outlets. Harvard graduates literally went to work for Newsweek, rather than private equity. Not anymore. ""Teen Vogue"" now has a news division and so does a New York based cat blog called BuzzFeed.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.

If you are an affluent single person in that gentrifying part of Brooklyn who likes cats -- of course, that's redundant, because they all like cats -- then you know and you love BuzzFeed. When a BuzzFeed headline commands you to ""Stop everything and watch this cat who loves the ocean,"" you do. You stop everything and you watch that cat.

When BuzzFeed offers one of its trademark cat quizzes, you dutifully take the quiz. What kind of ""purr-sonality"" does your cat actually have?"" Or ""How cat are you? Take this quiz."" Meow! You think you know a lot about cats, BuzzFeed knows more. On all questions feline, BuzzFeed is the final authority.

But what happens when BuzzFeed tries to do real news? Well, in early 2017, we found out the site released the now famous Trump dossier. It was a catalog of salacious and unverified gossip financed by the DNC originally about President-elect Trump.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Many other news outlets, nearly all of them anti-Trump, had seen the dossier, but passed on it. It was just too irresponsible to run. But not BuzzFeed. They thought it was purr-fect. Meow! So they ran it.

Two years ago later, the BuzzFeed dossier has come to define the entire Trump Russian collusion conspiracy tale. The problem is, a lot of dossier is pretty clearly untrue. For example, one of the key claims in the dossier that BuzzFeed ran is that Trump attorney Michael Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague. They never offered any evidence that that happened; there never was any evidence. And then finally last week, Michael Cohen himself confirmed it never happened in his testimony before lawmakers.

""Have you ever been to Prague?"" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. asked.

The Mueller investigation itself batted down BuzzFeed's story almost immediately after it came out, and yet, BuzzFeed never retracted the piece. Once again, in its feline way, the site pretended that nothing had happened. You can yell at a cat, but you can't make a cat pay attention it turns out.

Well, so, that seems like a pretty big development. Two years ago, BuzzFeed told us -- you remember, we did a show on it -- that Michael Cohen held a secret meeting with Russian spies in Prague. We have been hearing that about ever since in Congress and on cable news. We have, in fact, halted the normal workings of government in part because of that meeting. Now it turns out, it never took place. So it's not a small thing to learn from Michael Cohen.

How did BuzzFeed cover this latest stunning development? Well, they didn't cover it. They ignored it completely. As of Monday night, BuzzFeed was floating instead a story entitled, ""21 Completely Life Changing Things You Can Make in a Waffle Maker."" There was nothing about the non-existent Michael Cohen-Russian spy meeting in Prague. If you only read BuzzFeed, you would never know that that story was false.

Well, apparently, a lot of people in the media only read BuzzFeed and not simply for its lavish cat coverage. This January, BuzzFeed published a story with this sentence: ""President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow."" BuzzFeed presented no evidence to show that that was actually true, just unnamed sources. But it didn't matter. The cat lovers on cable news went crazy with the ""bombshell"" report.

It was really a bombshell actually, at least in some sense, it was. The claim was, anyway. Directing someone to lie under oath is a felony, and it ought to be. Had this been true, the Trump presidency likely would have ended, and for good reason, a legitimate reason.

But it was not true. Instead, it was a lot like the claim that, I don't know, a cat sucks the breath from babies or that a black cat brings bad luck. It was an old wives tale posing as fact.

The Mueller investigation itself batted down BuzzFeed's story almost immediately after it came out, and yet, BuzzFeed never retracted the piece. Once again, in its feline way, the site pretended that nothing had happened. You can yell at a cat, but you can't make a cat pay attention it turns out.

To be clear, here are the key quotes from the January BuzzFeed story: ""Trump directed his longtime attorney, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress."" And again, ""The President personally instructed him to lie."" ""It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia."" Explicitly telling a subordinate to lie, that's the claim. OK.

Democratic members of Congress asked Michael Cohen last week about that specific claim. Cohen was under oath at the time, a declared enemy of Donald Trump, not someone who had any reason to lie about this. Here is how he responded: ""Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates.""

Okay, let's try to make sure we've got this totally clear. Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie. He personally instructed him to lie. He ""explicitly told him to lie."" Those are the claims from BuzzFeed. Did Michael Cohen really do that? Here's his account again during the hearing.

U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.: Did the president, in any way. from your point of view, coach you in terms of how to respond to questions or the contents of your testimony before a House Committee?

Cohen: Again, it's difficult to answer because he doesn't tell you what he wants. What he does, again, ""Michael, there is no Russia. There is no collusion. There is no involvement. There is no interference."" I know what he means because I have been around him for so long. So, if you are asking me whether or not that's the message. That's staying on point, that's the party line that he created that so many others are now touting. Yes, that's the message he wanted to reinforce.

That's the message. So Michael Cohen says that Trump claimed there was no Russian collusion and no interference in the 2016 presidential election. If that sounds familiar, it's because that's exactly what Trump has been telling the world for two years, every day, in a loud voice to anyone who will listen.

"The recent expansion of the House Judiciary Committee's probes into President Donald Trump is more about aiding the Democrats in 2020 instead of seeking the truth, argued Townhall.com news editor Katie Pavlich on Monday.

The committee announced that it sent 81 letters to various members of the Trump White House, campaign and business with a request for documents.

During the Special Report ""All-Star"" panel, Pavlich, Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt, and Democratic strategist Jim Messina weighed in on the political impact the House Democrats' probes into the president will make going forward.

MAXINE WATERS: 'IMPEACHMENT' IS ONLY ANSWER

Pavlich began by insisting that the ""ball"" has been ""moved completely off of the field"" after Democrats have pivoted away from wanting to know about ""Russian collusion.""

""There is a proper role for Congress to play when it comes to oversight. However, this is not about investigating government scandals like Operation Fast and Furious or the IRS targeting of conservatives, this is about going after President Trump personally and using Congress and House committees with subpoenas to open up a treasure trove of opposition research for 2020 candidates,"" Pavlich said. ""And the truth is that impeachment might be good in a primary, but it's not going to be good in a general election.""

Messina told the panel that Democrats are being ""very careful"" in regards to impeachment, saying they've learned the lesson from Republicans after they impeached President Bill Clinton in the '90s.

""It's the balance of power and the House is going to look very deep into this stuff and they should,"" Messina said.

Meanwhile, Chris Stirewalt says people should ""keep a prayer"" and ""keep some sympathy"" for House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-NY, because as ""serious"" as he is, many in his party are ""much more radical"" and ""aggressive"" when it comes to Trump's impeachment.

""Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Nadler do not want to impeach Donald Trump unless they absolutely have to. They'd rather just beat him in 2020,"" Stirewalt said.",586,Fox News,House Dems' probes into Trump is about getting 'opposition research' for 2020 candidates: Katie Pavlich
"The premise of efforts to undermine Trump is that the establishment has such power, prestige, and authority to overturn the verdict of the 2016 election.

On September 5, 2018, the New York Times published an anonymous editorial by a supposed ""senior official"" in the Trump administration. In astounding fashion, the unnamed writer claimed that he/she was part of a legion of administration appointees and government officials who were actively working to undermine the Trump presidency by overriding his orders, keeping information from an unknowing Trump, or acting independently of his directives. Or as Anonymous unapologetically put it:

Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader.

It's not just that the special counsel looms large. Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr. Trump's leadership. Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall.

The dilemma -- which he does not fully grasp -- is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.

I would know. I am one of them.

The Times author then continues by confessing to a sort of slow-motion coup to undermine the Trump presidency:

It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't.

The result is a two-track presidency.

The writer then lists the supposed Trump sins and offers the following rationale for such extraordinary subversion on the part of self-elected conspirators:

This isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state.

Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until -- one way or another -- it's over.

The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility.

Most telling, however, given the supposed plethora of Trump sins, the author never cites a particular presidential act that by any coherent definition could be called illegal, dangerous, or unethical, much less unprecedented in presidential history. Indeed, Anonymous concedes that Trump has often been successful in his tenure: ""Don't get me wrong. There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.""

Yet Anonymous then boasts that such landmark success came because of others and in spite of Trump: ""But these successes have come despite -- not because of -- the president's leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.""

Trump's purported sins then arise largely in matters of executive ""style"" and supposedly unpresidential character: ""Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."" Anonymous did not square the circle of how such an incompetent and dangerous leader had accomplished such admittedly good things, often well beyond the ability of prior and supposedly better qualified and more sober Republican presidents.

The author concludes his opinion editorial by promising the country that like-minded unelected officials and bureaucrats have formed a ""resistance"" that will do its best to nullify the directives of the elected president and instead implement policies that they believe will take the country in the ""right direction"" -- and are the product of their apparently superior professionalism and a proper presidential tone that they associate with their own:

There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first. But the real difference will be made by everyday citizens rising above politics, reaching across the aisle and resolving to shed the labels in favor of a single one: Americans.

What neither the opinion writer nor the New York Times disclosed about their joint efforts of producing an anonymous op-ed on September 5 were some obvious considerations of sourcing, timing, and objectives.

First, the editorial appeared on the eve of a much publicized tell-all about the Trump White House by Washington Post investigative journalist Bob Woodward, whose latest book, Fear -- his nineteenth such expos√© mostly based on undisclosed and unnamed sources and without citations -- was scheduled to come out just six days later. Advance excerpts largely dovetailed with Anonymous's argument of a president whose inexperience and temperament ""scare"" those in government and force them to find ways to circumvent or obstruct his wishes.

The opinion piece also coincidentally was published just four days after the late Senator John McCain's funeral. McCain is lionized in the anonymous op-ed as the proper antithesis to Trump (""We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example -- a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue"").

At the funeral, eulogist after eulogist used the solemn occasion not just to praise John McCain, but also to blast Donald Trump. Oddly, McCain's final deification by his erstwhile critics and enemies was mostly a result of his own bitter and ongoing feud with Donald Trump that in his eleventh hour sanctified him to past presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Both their earlier presidential campaigns had once smeared McCain as a libertine and reckless (the Bush effort in 2000, especially during the South Carolina primary), and vilified him in 2008 as a near-demented racist (the Obama 2008 campaign). Due to his feud with Trump, in death McCain was transmogrified into angelic status by the very architects who in life were sometimes responsible for his demonization.

Finally, the McCain funeral and anonymous op-ed marked the return of former president Barack Obama to the campaign trail, as he began to give a series of angry and often bitter speeches on the eve of the 2018 midterms -- ironically both blasting Trump as dangerous and incompetent while taking credit for the apparently quite competent Trump handling of the economy. The common thread in all these coincidental events was not just collective hatred of Trump on the part of the establishment, but also the extraordinary means by which a proverbial deep state sought to subvert a supposedly extraordinarily dangerous outsider.

Usually ex-presidents do not blast their successors at funerals. A prior president customarily does not hit the campaign trail to level charges against a sitting president. State funerals are not regularly transmogrified into pep rallies. And anonymous members of an administration usually do not have the connections to publish lead New York Times editorials that channel Bob Woodward's sensational but unsourced allegations.

A cynic might have believed there had been some sort of collusive effort ahead of the 2018 midterm election to create a simultaneous and force-multiplying demonization of Trump -- almost as if there was a common effort coordinated by the major media, journalists, establishment politicians, and supposedly dozens of officials within government. But that idea would not completely be a conspiratorial conclusion, because Anonymous boasted of the presence of such an organized ""resistance"" inside the government.

A final, even more disturbing note: the deep state is neither transparent nor confident in its criticisms, at least enough to name names in its near-subversionary efforts. Both past presidents and Megan McCain, daughter of John McCain, in their funeral eulogies trashed Trump -- to the glee of editorials in the major papers.

But none of them completed their politicization of the service by mentioning Donald Trump by name. Nor did Anonymous ever disclose his name or come forward publicly to present particular examples of documented wrongdoing. Nor did Bob Woodward cite most of his sources, name his informants, or produce footnoted data to assure the readers of the veracity of his sensational charges. Instead, the premise was that the establishment has such power, prestige, and authority that it has no need to reveal its methodologies and sources -- once it claimed the higher moral ground and felt that it had not just the right, but indeed the duty, to overturn the verdict of the 2016 election.",587,nationalreview.com,Anonymous Strikes  --  Again and Again | National Review
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust weeks ahead of national elections; Trey Yingst reports from the Middle East.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing indictment on charges of fraud, corruption, breach of trust and bribery. He's also running for re-election, and with less than six weeks until ballots are scheduled to be cast in Israel, some have raised suspicions of a political hit, not unlike the various hearings and investigations ensnaring President Trump.

From a geostrategic standpoint there is no one, including Netanyahu's political opponents, in the prime minister's league when it comes to national security, economics and politics. In this, again, he in some ways resembles President Trump.

Recall Netanyahu's speech to the United Nations General Assembly last September in which he conducted a ""show and tell"" drama with pictures of a secret Iranian nuclear facility, as well as hidden missiles in Beirut. The speech was a searing indictment of the West's wishful thinking when it comes to Iran, the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration and the intentions of radical Muslim terrorists.

ISRAEL AWAITS DECISION ON NETANYAHU CORRUPTION INDICTMENT

As David M. Weinberg wrote in The Jerusalem Post in 2017, ""An overwhelming majority of Israelis ascribes the last decade of stability and triumph to Netanyahu's leadership. He may not be the ultimate paragon of virtue - what politician is? But his prudence and professionalism have best served Israel's strategic needs.""

Compared to the survival of Israel, the charges brought against Netanyahu are small potatoes.

Which brings me to President Trump. Those who criticize Trump supporters, including his evangelical Christian base, say the standard they applied to President Clinton and his behavior has been abandoned when it comes to Trump. These critics say the economy was also good under Clinton (one argument Trump supporters say is in the current president's favor), but that he received no credit from those who claimed then that personal character matters most.

All true, but what about a president's policies? Should they matter more? President Clinton named justices to the Supreme Court and lower courts who are liberal interpreters of the Constitution and who uphold abortion rights. He also raised taxes, though he and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich did agree on welfare reform.

The question becomes: Which would you choose - questionable character or appealing policies?

Yes, conservatives and evangelicals would prefer a church-going, once-married, faithful politician (like Vice President Mike Pence), but if the choice is between socialism and capitalism, between conservative and liberal judges, between more abortions or fewer, between redefining marriage and defending its once legal - even biblical - definition, between a strong economy and a weaker one, between record low unemployment and higher numbers of the unemployed, between open borders and controlling illegal immigration, the choice isn't that difficult.

A look at history reveals some pretty bad characters whose policies were well regarded. As Britishheritage.com notes, ""Winston Churchill was a strong and bullish leader. His leadership during WWII is remembered very fondly. ... Many, however, deem Churchill culpable in a plethora of human rights violations, and question his views toward races different to his own.""

Benjamin Franklin was no paragon of virtue, but his assistance in founding America, along with his inventions, are highly regarded by historians. The same is true for Thomas Jefferson and other founders who owned slaves.

In modern times, John F. Kennedy was a notorious adulterer but is credited with establishing the Peace Corps and launching America to the moon. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, fought for civil rights and open housing laws, but, according to his biographer, Robert Caro, used racist language in private.

The point is not to excuse bad behavior in leadership, but to examine their policies to see if they promote the general welfare. In the cases on Netanyahu and Trump, they have. Whether those policies overcome whatever personal flaws these men have will be up to Israel's legal system and voters next month and the U.S. legal system and voters next year.",588,Fox News,Trump and Netanyahu -- The secret to success that both men share
"Howard Kurtz: Why moderate governors are a tough sell for the White House

The Democratic stampede is under way, with candidates charging in who have little national name recognition.

The latest two entrants are governors with solid records, but no record of exciting anyone. They are basically running as competent managers, which may be admirable, but is also a tough sell in a polarized environment where all the Democratic energy seems to be on the left.

John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, and Jay Inslee, the current Washington governor, probably figure they have as good a shot as anyone else -- and that the national attention couldn't hurt, even if they flame out.

And then there's Andrew Cuomo, who's making the case for a nominee very much like him -- but only dropping the barest hints that he might run.

CUOMO APPEALS TO BEZOS TO BRING AMAZON BACK TO NYC: REPORT

The New York Times says Hickenlooper is a ""socially progressive, pro-business Democrat who has called himself an 'extreme moderate.'""

Even a friend of Hickenlooper is quoted as saying: ""There are very few people I know who wake up and want to go caucus to support a raging moderate.""

And his spokeswoman ""compared a potential Hickenlooper-Trump election to 'a ""Revenge of the Nerds""-type situation.'""

Running as a nerd doesn't strike me as a winning formula in the Trump era.

Liberal Washington Post columnist Paul Waldman says that ""in a different year he might have been a strong contender"" as a ""reasonably successful and well-liked governor, middle-aged white guy."" But he argues that it's as though Hickenlooper ""parachuted in from a few decades ago and has no idea how politics works in 2019 or what sorts of impediments the next Democratic president is going to face"" -- namely, fierce Republican opposition.

Inslee, a former congressman, is running with climate change as his overriding priority, trying to separate himself from the rest of the field. But as the Post noted, ""despite his calls for drastic action to combat climate change, Inslee's most ambitious climate initiative -- the institution of a tax on carbon emissions -- was voted down in the state's November elections amid massive opposition spending from oil companies.""

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

A Seattle Times story observes that ""it remains to seen whether Inslee can stand out even on his signature issue, given that other Democratic candidates have expressed support, at least in principle, for a shift to a clean energy economy dubbed the Green New Deal.""

The Cuomo chatter is fueled by an Atlantic piece that featured several hours of interviews with the third-term New York governor.

Cuomo keeps dodging the question of whether he'd like to be president, and then says Joe Biden is running anyway. And if Biden doesn't run? ""Call me back,"" says Cuomo.

On paper, Cuomo would be a strong candidate, having accomplished such liberal goals as same-sex marriage and gun control in one of the biggest blue states. But at home he's often criticized for not being liberal enough.

""Cuomo made it clear that he thinks most of the Democrats running for president are going off a cliff, feeling out how far left they can go while still saying Sanders is too far left.""

GOVERNOR INSLEE WANTS TO DEFEAT CLIMATE CHANGE

In other words, he's kinda sorta making the case for himself without doing so.

I covered his father, Mario Cuomo, who was also a third-term governor in 1991 when he left a plane on a runway rather than fly to New Hampshire on the last day of the filing deadline to challenge Bill Clinton and others.

My sense is that the current governor shares that aversion to a White House bid, or he would have done more to lay the groundwork before now.

"Former FBI Director James Comey on Monday weighed in on the pending report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, urging transparency in the handling of the probe's final results.

In an Op-Ed for The Washington Post, Comey wrote that ""transparency is especially important where polarized politics and baseless attacks challenge law enforcement's credibility.

""In critical matters of national importance, a straightforward report of what facts have been learned and how judgment has been exercised may be the only way to advance the public interest,"" he continued.

AG WILLIAM BARR NOT RECUSING HIMSELF FROM RUSSIA PROBE, OFFICIAL SAYS

Comey went on to list examples, in his estimation, in which the Justice Department shared detailed information with the public. He specified the 2014 killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri and the October 2015 instance in which the Justice Department publically shared information about the IRS allegedly targeting tea party groups, as worthy reasons for the DOJ to speak out.

""These cases represent the way the Justice Department has always approached its mission -- speak only in prosecuted cases, unless the public really needs to know,"" Comey wrote.

Democrats, Comey argued, were wrong for fighting transparency in 2016 in regard to the DOJ's handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. But now, Comey wrote, the GOP is at fault for allegedly battling against fully releasing the Mueller probe results.

""It is hard to imagine a case of greater public interest than one focused on the efforts of a foreign adversary to damage our democracy, and in which the president of the United States is a subject,"" Comey wrote.

""I don't know all the considerations that will go into deciding precisely what to say about the completion of the special counsel's work and when to say it. It's always important to consider guidelines and routines. But don't listen to those who tell you transparency is impossible.

"Ann Saladin, creator of MyGirlScoutCouncil.com, and co-editor Christy Volanski, have spent nearly a decade documenting Girl Scouts USA's relationships with the abortion industry, Planned Parenthood, and political leaders who support abortion and a left-wing agenda in general.

""At the very least, it's a cozy relationship,"" Volanski told Breitbart News as she described the ties between the Girl Scouts, the abortion industry and, specifically, Planned Parenthood.

On Friday, MyGirlScoutCouncil posted to Facebook that the Girl Scouts Gold Award - its highest honor - went to a ""reproductive health justice"" project to ""educate people about and destigmatize access to women's healthcare"":

In December, the Girl Scouts of the Central California Coast Instagram account featured a post celebrating alumna and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, specifically because ""she was a key swing vote in many important cases, including the upholding of Roe v. Wade"":

Conflicting information from the Girl Scouts and the organization's officials about its ties to the abortion industry has stirred up further controversy about these relationships.

The organization states on its website, regarding the issues of human sexuality, birth control, and abortion, it ""does not take a position or develop materials on these issues."" Similarly, Girl Scouts denies having ""a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood.""

Volanski noted, however, that local Girl Scout councils and individual troops are permitted to partner with Planned Parenthood.

In the video below from October 2011 - cited by PJ Media - former Girl Scouts USA CEO Kathy Cloninger confirmed a partnership between Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood.

""We partner with many organizations,"" Cloninger said. ""We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls.""

The Girl Scouts also state that ""[e]very Girl Scout and Girl Guide organization is a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts -- and each Member Organization, including Girl Scouts of the USA, pays dues.""

The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), however, is an organization that advocates globally for abortion rights.

Volanski explained while some media outlets are emphasizing that Girl Scouts does not send funds specifically from cookie sales directly to Planned Parenthood, ""the fact that Girl Scouts exposes girls to Planned Parenthood through their organization is much more insidious than a financial relationship.""

""Many Girl Scout critics focus primarily on the relationship between Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood, but the concerns are so much broader than this one concerning connection,"" Volanski asserted. ""The Girl Scout organization features many progressive pro-abortion organizations, activists, politicians and events to its girl members.""

She cited the Girl Scout organization's recent promotion and participation in the Teen Vogue Summit as an example.

""The Teen Vogue Summit focused on 'reproductive justice,' and featured speakers such as former Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards and manager of Youth Organizing for Planned Parenthood, Sharim Hossain,"" Volanski explained.

The Girl Scouts USA is also a member organization of the Coalition for Adolescent Girls (CAG), which advocates for abortion, contraception and comprehensive sex education for girls. In addition to the Girl Scouts, CAG includes International Planned Parenthood; global abortion provider Marie Stopes International; the sexuality-focused Advocates for Youth; the Institute for Reproductive Health; the United Nations Foundation; and the Bill and Melinda Gates-funded Women Deliver organization, that focuses on access to contraception and abortion.

Saladin stressed to Breitbart News that one of Girl Scouts' most disturbing more recent partnerships has been with the Teen Vogue Summit.

""GSUSA's recent sponsorship, participation, and promotion of the Teen Vogue Summit, which featured 'reproductive justice' among its topics, is the latest example at odds with their assurance that 'GSUSA does not take a position or develop materials on these issues [human sexuality, birth control, and abortion],'"" she said. ""If tweeting out the pro-abortion mantra 'My body, my choice, my rights' isn't taking a position, I don't know what is.""

Under the guise of ""civic engagement,"" the Girl Scouts organization appears focused on a certain brand of politics.

In 2019, Girl Scouts launched a K-12 program called the Girls' Access to Education ""civic engagement toolkit"" in partnership with Global Girls Alliance.

""The Global Girls Alliance is a program developed by the Obama Foundation to empower adolescent girls around the world through education,"" Girl Scouts states. ""To advance these goals, the Global Girls Alliance supports grassroots leaders, like Girl Scouts of the USA, who best understand the unique challenges girls face in their communities and the strategies needed to overcome them.""

""Civic engagement"" at the Girl Scouts also means participating at the Teen Vogue Summit, which features voter information and registration provided by the left-wing Rock the Vote.

""Rock the Vote was additionally featured at Girl Scouts USA's G.I.R.L. Agenda 2018: Leading Change Through Civic Action, as well as a suggested resource for one of Girl Scouts' voting themed badges,"" Saladin observed.

In June 2018, LA Weekly described the Teen Vogue Summit as ""a three-day symposium focused on the hot topics that young Gen Z women care about.""

The summit emphasized ""grassroots social activism,"" the report stated, and the panels ""addressed a grab-bag of progressive topics,"" such as ""menstrual power and reproductive justice; LGBTQ+ rights; bipartisan environmentalism in the face of climate change; and humane immigration policy, among others.""

The report added the inaugural event featured ""former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, California Rep. Maxine Waters, producer Ava DuVernay, Black Lives Matter co-founder DeRey McKesson and young actresses Storm Reid and Black-ish star Yara Shahidi, among others.""

""It's really thrilling to see,"" said Jen Tolentino, director of policy and civic tech at Rock the Vote, which LA Weekly noted was ""on-site to help register any freshly minted or soon-to-turn-18-year-olds -- and in sync with the 20-state voter registration bus tour the Parkland survivors would announce mere days later.""

But a new poll suggests his age and self-identification as a 'democratic socialist' could hurt the independent senator from Vermont if he reaches the 2020 general election. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal public opinion survey tested 11 different presidential characteristics among registered voters nationwide. The most widely accepted - being an African American (87 percent said they were 'enthusiastic' or 'comfortable' with that characteristic), a white man (86 percent), a woman (84 percent), and gay or lesbian (68 percent). The least popular characteristics? Being over the age of 75 (37 percent) and a socialist (25 percent). Sanders - at 77 - is the oldest declared or potential presidential candidate in the 2020 field. And he's been repeatedly labeled by Republicans as a socialist.

In early surveys of the Democratic field -- which mostly reflect name recognition at this point -- he is polling between 0 and 1 percent. ... What Hickenlooper does have going for him is that he may be more skilled than most at getting his name out there. He's run some of the best political ads in recent memory, including endearing spots about parking meters and his humble wardrobe, which helped him stand out in a wide-open field (sound familiar?) during his first run for mayor. ... His quirky personality was his secret political weapon in Colorado, but it's unclear how it'll shake out on a national stage, where his demographics -- older, white, male -- may pigeonhole him as a retread.""

Thanks but no thanks, Bubba - AP: ""Nearly 20 years after he left the White House, Bill Clinton is still sought after for advice by some Democrats running for president. But the names on his dance card in recent months underscore how much his standing in the party has changed. So far, none of the party's early front-runners has had a formal meeting with Clinton. Nor have the women who are running in the historically diverse primary field. Instead, Clinton has spoken mostly with male candidates who are considered longshots for the Democratic nomination, including Montana Gov.

TIME OUT: MAKE WAY FOR THE PAW PAW

Atlantic: ""In 1916, agricultural experts voted the pawpaw the American fruit most likely to succeed, ahead of blueberries and cranberries. But today most people have never even heard of it, let alone tried it. What is the pawpaw, and how did we forget it? ... The pawpaw belongs to a family of tropical fruits called custard apples, and its cousins are popular throughout Central and South America. ... What, then, is the tropical pawpaw doing so far north -- and why has it been overlooked? The answer to the first question is simple, according to Andrew Moore, the author of Pawpaw: In Search of America's Forgotten Fruit: It was likely transported from the tropics in the intestines of very large animals. ... The answer to the second question is more complex. ... According to Devon Mihesuah ... the pawpaw was not only enjoyed as food, but also valued as the raw material for products as diverse as head-lice shampoo and ropes. ... 'I'm not sure that it's been forgotten. I think it's been ignored, disliked, and unavailable,' [Mihesuah said.]""

SENATE SET FOR HISTORIC REBUKE OF TRUMP

NYT: ""Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said on Sunday that he would support a resolution that would overturn President Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, appearing to provide the crucial vote needed for the Senate to pass the measure. 'I stand with the president often, and I do so with a loud voice,' Mr. Paul wrote in an opinion piece published late Sunday on Fox News's website. 'Today, I think he's wrong, not on policy, but in seeking to expand the powers of the presidency beyond their constitutional limits.' 'I cannot support the use of emergency powers to get more funding' for a wall along the border with Mexico, he wrote, 'so I will be voting to disapprove of his declaration when it comes before the Senate.' Mr. Paul joins three other Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- in backing the resolution. His support appears to provide the slim majority Democrats need to send the measure to the president's desk, offering a stinging repudiation of the declaration.""

Pergram: Behind the scenes on the Senate vote on the Trump emergency - Fox News: ""The decision by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) to vote in favor of blocking President Trump's national emergency declaration for the border sets two things in motion on Capitol Hill: 1) It all but guarantees passage of the resolution overturning the declaration in the Senate. 2) It tees up President Trump's first veto effort. The Senate math is currently 53 Republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. All 47 Democrats are expected to vote in favor of the resolution, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va. When asked last week how he'd vote, Manchin told Fox he'd vote yes. Manchin also cited the fact that he now held the seat of the legendary, late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W. Va. Byrd was very protective of Congressional prerogatives. He was also a longtime chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. In other words, Byrd would probably take a dim view of Manchin if he voted otherwise.""

TRUMPWORLD FACES SUBPOENA AVALANCHE

Fox News: ""House Democrats opened a huge new avenue Monday in their investigations into President Trump, with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee firing off document requests to dozens of figures from the president's administration, family and business. Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Monday the committee served document requests to 81 agencies, entities and individuals, as part of a new probe into 'alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump.' In addition to the White House, Nadler is also seeking information from Trump family members, like Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Jared Kushner; from former administration figures like former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former national security adviser Mike Flynn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former spokeswoman Hope Hicks; and from Trump campaign figures like Brad Parscale and Corey Lewandowski. ...

A CRIME PANDEMIC

Fox News: ""A Wisconsin man's attempt to play a prank on his neighbors ended up devolving into a literal panda-monium last month after police were called to a neighborhood on a report of a suspicious animal. The Muskego Police Department told CBS58 the incident took place on Feb 22, after a resident contacted authorities to report a panda bear being spotted at the front door of a home. The caller thought it was suspicious since panda bears are not native to the Badger State. 'It's a big teddy bear,' the caller told the operator in a recording of the call obtained by CBS58. ... Officers responded to the home and made contact with the panda bear, who turned out to be a 48-year-old resident in a costume. The man, who does not want to be identified, told CBS58 he had been asked to dog-sit at a friend's house and thought dressing up to do it would be a fun prank. ... The man said he knew his neighbors had surveillance cameras and wanted to prank them by donning the $125 suit.""

"Everybody, sorry I've been out of touch all day. I had to go out of town unexpectedly today, and have been away from the keys. One of the nice things about this blog is when I don't post when people think I should, folks start writing to ask if I'm okay. Some good news: in February, this here blog received over one million unique visitors -- the twelfth month in a row we've done this. Overall, TAC had another great month as well. Thank you!

Here's a fascinating story from The Atlantic: a map of American political prejudice. Guess where researchers found that the most politically prejudiced people live, and who they are? Read on:

In general, the most politically intolerant Americans, according to the analysis, tend to be whiter, more highly educated, older, more urban, and more partisan themselves. This finding aligns in some ways with previous research by the University of Pennsylvania professor Diana Mutz, who has found that white, highly educated people are relatively isolated from political diversity. They don't routinely talk with people who disagree with them; this isolation makes it easier for them to caricature their ideological opponents. (In fact, people who went to graduate school have the least amount of political disagreement in their lives, as Mutz describes in her book Hearing the Other Side.) By contrast, many nonwhite Americans routinely encounter political disagreement. They have more diverse social networks, politically speaking, and therefore tend to have more complicated views of the other side, whatever side that may be.

We see this dynamic in the heat map. In some parts of the country, including swaths of North Carolina and upstate New York, people still seem to give their fellow Americans the benefit of the doubt, even when they disagree. In other places, including much of Massachusetts and Florida, people appear to have far less tolerance for political difference. They may be quicker to assume the worst about their political counterparts, on average.

White, highly educated people are the most politically intolerant in the entire country. These are the people who congregate in Boston, New York, and Washington. I would love to see the demographic breakdown of who the decision-makers in major-media newsrooms are, as well as in other US institutions. We know from other demographic data that the more educated you are, the more likely you are to be liberal.

Look at this finding: ""the most politically intolerant county in America appears to be Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which includes the city of Boston."" Here's a map of Suffolk County:

Cambridge, home of Harvard University, is in neighboring Middlesex County. According to the researchers, it is equally as prejudiced as Suffolk County. So the most elite university in America is also located in the county that is most prejudiced -- in this case, against Republicans.

How about that? Mercer County, NJ (home of Princeton) and New Haven County, CT (home of Yale), are also ""considerably more prejudiced"" against Republicans than most other counties in the US.

Note well: it is also the case that Republicans who live in these same counties are highly prejudiced against Democrats. But they are small minorities in those places.

If you are an educated liberal in a major US city like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, you are unlikely to know and deal with Republicans. The cultural and political establishments in those cities are quite liberal. Interestingly, the partisan polarization in other cities is equally strong. In Dallas, Houston, and Austin, both sides are strongly prejudiced against the other; the establishments in all three cities, though, are Democratic. Most people outside Texas don't realize that. Note too that the entire state of Florida scores strongly on the polarization scale. I found it fascinating that except for the heavily populated counties around NYC, the State of New York is pretty much the least politically polarized state in the US.

More from the article:

As politics have become more about identity than policy, partisan leanings have become more about how we grew up and where we feel like we belong. Politics are acting more like religion, in other words.

This is partly because partisan identities have begun to line up with other identities, as Lilliana Mason describes in her book, Uncivil Agreement. Making assumptions about people's politics based on their race or religiosity is easier than it was in the past. Black people get typed as Democrats; people who go to church on Sunday are assumed to be Republicans. (But as always, stereotypes still mask complexity: about half of black Americans go to church at least once a week, for example, a far higher rate than that of white Americans.)

In other words, partisan prejudice now includes a bunch of other prejudices, all wrapped up into one tangled mess. ""Americans are really divided, but not in terms of policy; they're divided in terms of identity,"" Mason says. ""And the more identities come into play, the more salient they are, the harder it will be to agree, even if policy positions shift."" Politics are becoming a proxy battle for other deep divisions that have almost nothing to do with environmental regulation or tax policies. [Emphasis mine -- RD]

Read the whole thing. It's worthwhile, though nothing about it is encouraging. What stood out the most to me, though, is that the people who are in charge of the media, and our cultural institutions, and the ones who bang on the most about ""diversity,"" are pretty much extremely intolerant, monocultural white liberals. Whatever else you might say about him, Trump has these people figured out.",593,The American Conservative,Least Tolerant: Educated White Liberals
"From the left: Hate-Trump Progressives Defend Dictators

President Trump's critics are right to be skeptical of his policies in Venezuela, given his ""utter indifference"" to the suffering under similar regimes in Russia, China, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, argues The Washington Post's Max Boot. But ""the proper response to Trump's hypocrisy is not to castigate him for opposing the strongman in Caracas but to urge him to do more to oppose other despots."" Yet ""some on the far left seem to hate Trump more"" than they do Nicol√°s Maduro. So ""they are de facto siding with a dictator who has turned a once prosperous and democratic country into an oppressive and impoverished hellhole."" Progressives need to learn that ""the enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend."" Those who think otherwise ""are as hypocritical as Trump is.""

Policy wonk: Deal Ignores System's Deepest Problems

The joint plan announced by Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio to reorganize the MTA ""deserves little applause,"" says City Journal's Connor Harris. Besides giving the governor even more power over New York City's streets and subways, its proposed measures ""ignore the MTA's most pressing problem: soaring labor costs that will eventually drive the agency to bankruptcy."" Also dubious: the proposal to use ""design-build contracting, which combines design and construction work."" This, when ""the exemplar of ¬≠design-build in New York,"" the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement, ""still ran up a higher price tag than more complex projects overseas."" Harris' prediction: ""By focusing on minor or spurious problems while ignoring excessive labor costs and overstaffing, the plan guarantees that congestion-pricing revenue will be squandered.""

Conservative: Nadler Signals Impeachment Is On

In declaring Sunday that it was ""very clear"" President Trump had ¬≠""obstructed justice,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler ""sounded less like a man weighing the evidence than a man who has made up his mind,"" suggests The Washington Examiner's Byron York. But it also raises a question: ""Why is Nadler, who heads the committee in the House that originates articles of impeachment, not moving forward with impeaching President Trump right now?"" Nadler's response: ""We don't have the facts yet"" -- a ""perplexing admission"" from someone who had just ""confidently enumerated the president's crimes."" In fact, says York, Nadler gave ""the clearest indication yet that Democrats have ¬≠decided to impeach Trump and are now simply ¬≠doing the legwork involved in making that happen.""

Foreign desk: Can Trump Save Bibi -- and Will He?

One of the more ""fantastical myths about the US-Israeli relationship is that they don't intervene in our politics, and we don't intervene in theirs,"" notes veteran Mideast negotiator Aaron David Miller at Politico. Fact is, ""American presidents have been mucking around in Israeli politics for decades."" So he's betting that President Trump not only wants to see Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu re-elected, he'll also ""do everything he can to make it so."" After all, from Trump's perspective, helping Bibi ""fend off his challengers is great politics, especially looking toward 2020."" And Netanyahu ""is all too willing to be a political asset for Trump."" The president likely ""would jettison Netanyahu in a heartbeat, if there were compelling reasons to do so."" For now, though, ""there are reasons to stand by him.""

Victor Davis Hanson is a professor, Hoover Institution fellow and farmer, a scholar of military history and ancient Greece. His works have been lauded by both left and right.

"Pope Francis called on Catholics to embrace political pluralism Monday, insisting that there is no longer any place for a ""Catholic party.""

""I invite you to live your faith with great freedom, never believing that there is a single form of political commitment for Catholics: a Catholic party,"" the pope told a delegation of young Latin Americans from the Academy of Catholic Leaders Monday. ""A Catholic party no longer works.""

""In politics, it is better to have a polyphony inspired by the same faith and composed of different sounds and instruments than a dull, monotonous melody that is seemingly correct but homogenizing and neutralizing,"" he added. ""No, it's not the way.""

Citing Pope Paul VI, Francis said Catholics are well aware that ""in concrete situations, and taking account of solidarity in each person's life, one must recognize a legitimate variety of possible options. The same Christian faith can lead to different commitments.""

Francis also quoted the recently canonized Salvadoran saint, Oscar Romero, noting that the Church ""cannot be identified with any organization, even with those that call themselves and feel Christian. The Church is not the organization, nor the organization is the Church.""

The pontiff praised the Academy of Catholic Leaders for ""seeking faithfulness to the gospel"" while embracing ""plurality in partisan terms.""

Pope Francis, who has been an outspoken critic of new populist movements in Europe, seemed to change his tune Monday, throwing his support behind new groups of populist origin in Latin America.

""It is necessary to value in a new way our people and the popular movements that express their vitality, their history, and their most authentic struggles,"" Francis said. ""Doing politics inspired by the gospel from the people in action becomes a powerful way to heal our fragile democracies and to open up space to reinvent new representative groups of popular origin.""

As a vocation for service, the pope said, politics ""helps the people become the protagonists of their own history and thus prevents the so-called 'ruling classes' from believing that they are the ones who can fix everything.""

A politician is in the midst of his people and makes use of the means at his disposal ""to make the people who are sovereign the protagonists of their own history,"" he said.

In previous addresses, Pope Francis has come down hard against populism, comparing it to Hitler and insisting that it is born of selfishness.

In a speech to European heads of state in 2017, the pope said that solidarity is ""the most effective antidote to modern forms of populism,"" while advocating for a stronger, consolidated Europe against a rising tide of populist movements.

On that occasion, the pontiff contrasted solidarity, which draw us ""closer to our neighbors,"" with populism, which is ""the fruit of an egotism that hems people in and prevents them from overcoming and 'looking beyond' their own narrow vision.""

In 2018, the pope likened populists to Adolf Hitler and suggested that populism caused the Second World War.

""It is important for young people to know how populism is born,"" the pope said. ""I think of Hitler in the last century, who had promised development for Germany. They should know how populisms begin: by sowing hate. You can't live sowing hate.""

Less than two months ago, Francis compared the emergence of populist and nationalist movements in Europe to the days of Nazi Germany, suggesting that populism is the greatest threat to modern, multilateral governance.",595,Breitbart,"Pope Francis: In Politics, a 'Catholic Party' No Longer Works"
"What happens now that Trump and Kim Jong Un have walked away from negotiations with no deal?

When President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un abruptly ended the denuclearization talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, watchdog groups reported that Christian persecution was ""worsening"" in North Korea.

And for many human rights groups, the talks were another chance to bring up the plight of the people suffering under the North Korean regime -- especially Christians, who are seen as enemies of the state.

Several experts weighed in on the impact, with varying views but all giving hope for the future.

""President Trump is a tough, shrewd business negotiator, and for him to walk away is just a tactic to get a better deal later,"" David Ro, East Asia regional director for the Lausanne Movement, told Christianity Today. ""I foresee a better deal coming with the U.S. slowly lifting sanctions and North Korea dismantling their nuclear weapons.""

Ro believes it will take many more rounds and believes Trump's trade deal with China will inevitably come before any deal with North Korea.

""It will be a long road ahead, but at least now there is more optimism of a U.S.-North Korea deal than ever before,"" he added.

AT HANOI SUMMIT, CHINA'S XI SAW A PRESIDENT WILLING TO WALK AWAY: GORDON CHANG

Ro's colleague, Jamie Kim, the chair of the Lausanne Movement's North Korea Committee, believes further dialogue will result in Christian engagement.

""Christians have led the way toward bridge building in the last 20-plus years, and the summit can potentially open the border between North and South Korea. While many of the Western NGOs and businesses have abandoned North Korea, it is the Christians who have stayed the ground,"" Kim said.

In the meantime, Kim says Christians and non-profits should train and prepare for work inside the country should a door open in the next few years.

An anonymous Seoul-based researcher on North Korean affairs noted the United States' travel ban preventing Americans from traveling to North Korea is not helping in a crucial need to expose the people to outsiders.

""Any genuine transformation in the treatment of Christians in the country is unlikely to happen without a risky change in the regime's approach to governance or, indeed, a complete change in the regime itself to a new government that allows freedom of religion,"" the researcher explained.

Open Doors USA told Fox News Christian persecution is worsening in North Korea, according to their sources on the ground.

""Tens of thousands of people are in concentration camps because they professed faith or were caught owning a Bible. We have seen little change thus far,"" David Curry, president and CEO of Open Doors USA, said.

The group sent out a prayer alert last week amid the Trump-Kim summit and the reports of growing Christian persecution within the country and at the border with China.

Justin Hastings, a University of Sydney professor of international relations and comparative politics, said the summit is unlikely to help Christians, only in the long term, because ""Christian influence in North Korea is one of the North Korean regime's fears.""

Ben Torry, director of the Fourth River Project, thinks the summit may actually make things worse but he isn't giving up hope.

"America needs a court in its proper place, and Justice Roberts should remember a fundamental truth -- the chief's institution needs the chief's originalism.

There's a wooing going on. John Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, has been defined as the new ""swing vote,"" and he's now the most powerful jurist in the land. And that means the legal Left is beckoning him. It's calling to him. And how are they doing this? By putting him at war with himself -- setting up a conflict between Roberts the ""institutionalist"" and Roberts the ""originalist;"" between Roberts the jurist and guardian of the legacy of the Court and Roberts the ""ideologue.""

It works something like this -- let's suppose a key abortion case comes before the court, or the court considers an important conflict between the Trump administration and the special counsel's office. According to this construct, it's Roberts the ideologue who would vote to restrict abortion rights. It's Roberts the conservative who would back the Trump administration. But a chief justice who cared about the institution of the Supreme Court? Well, he guards Roe. He checks Trump.

I can think of few better examples of the temptation of John Roberts than an extended essay by Michael O'Donnell in The Atlantic centered around Joan Biskupic's new book about the chief justice. Framing the alleged conflict between Roberts's judicial philosophy and his responsibilities as chief, O'Donnell asks, ""What will Roberts do if the clerk calls some form of the case Mueller v. Trump, raising a grave matter of first principles, such as presidential indictment and self-pardon?""

The proper answer to that question is obvious -- he should decide the case on the basis of the text and original public meaning of the Constitution and any other relevant statutes. But O'Donnell has a different response. ""He portrays himself as an institutionalist, but we do not yet know to what extent this is true. He must necessarily prove himself on a case-by-case basis, which injects a note of drama into his movements."" (Emphasis added.)

Prove himself to whom? The progressive legal establishment, of course.

There was a similar dynamic in play during a recent episode of the New York Times's excellent podcast, The Daily. Analyzing Roberts's recent decision to side with the liberal justices and temporarily block enforcement of a Louisiana abortion restriction, the host, Michael Barbaro, and Times legal correspondent Adam Liptak described Roberts's decision once again in institutionalist terms. He allegedly set aside his ideology to do what was presumed to be best for the court.

But wait -- why is ""institutionalism"" so often synonymous with upholding beloved progressive precedent or upholding beloved progressive statutes? Would there be similar hand-wringing if, say, a more progressive court reversed Supreme Court precedents like Heller, Citizens United, or Hobby Lobby? I suspect not.

In reality, there is no conflict between originalism and institutionalism. In fact, originalism will do more over the long run to sustain and enhance the institutional legitimacy of the high court than any short-term political calculation. The true threat to the Supreme Court's legitimacy isn't any given decision or opinion. No, the true threat to the institution is its outsized role in American public life. Just as America suffers because Congress has ceded much of its authority to the executive, our political culture is dysfunctional in part because the Court has strayed too far from its constitutional bounds. Its unelected, life-term justices have entirely too much power over American lives.

There is no better example of this phenomenon than the Roe precedent itself. Decades ago, a court completely unmoored from the text of the Constitution yanked one of the most important and contentious public debates of modern times almost entirely out of the democratic process. And yet the wise men and women of the legal Left will now claim that the very legitimacy of the court depends on protecting a fundamentally illegitimate precedent.

And what would happen if Roe is overturned? The court's role in American life would diminish. More democracy would happen, from coast to coast, as American states enacted laws that reflected their populations' values. Presidential elections would be less fraught, as the stakes of American elections would grow higher at the state and local level -- exactly where the founders intended Americans to focus their political efforts.

That's one issue. Let's turn to a possible showdown with the Trump administration. We cannot define legitimacy or institutionalism merely as ""beating Trump."" One cannot believe that the court will remain ""legitimate,"" especially in the eyes of a vast number of citizens, if the chief justice is seen to depart from the language of the relevant law in an effort to enhance the ephemeral ""prestige"" of the Court -- as defined mainly by scholars and pundits on the opposite side of the political divide.

Given the rather obvious flaws in the idea that any class of commentators can define the institutional interests of the Court better than a justice reading and applying the law in good faith, why are thoughtful progressive commentators spilling ink on the idea that Roberts can be won over? Perhaps because they perceive there is precedent -- the Obamacare case.

Biskupic's book seems to confirm what many conservatives have long suspected, that Roberts ""started in a different place."" He was going to strike down the individual mandate, but he was ""torn between his heart and his head."" O'Donnell claims that if Roberts had voted against the mandate, he would have ""further eroded the Court's claim to transcend politics after the image-shattering decisions in Bush v. Gore (2000) and Citizens United (2010)."" There is no mention of the ""image-shattering decisions"" in Griswold (""penumbras and emanations"") or Roe or, more recently, Obergefell.

At the most basic level, originalism is institutionalism. Originalism places the institution of the Supreme Court (and Article III courts more broadly) in its proper constitutional place. It subordinates the Court by elevating the text of the Constitution and the text of the laws the Court interprets. It allows citizens to impact government not through the fraught, decades-long process of replacing life-term judges, but by the more immediate and democratic process of changing statutes.

No one doubts that moving the Court back to the text will be politically painful. Overturning Roe would generate an enormous public response, but does anyone want to argue that the current post-Roe political culture is just fine? Does anyone want to argue that the court's previous transparent political calculations have lowered the temperature of public debate?

John Roberts is a good man who understands the American Constitution. I have far less faith in his ability to gauge the medium-term -- much less long-term -- political and cultural effects of his decisions on the reputation of the court. Yet the progressive establishment calls on him to forsake the former for the latter. Remember your institution, they cry.

America needs a court in its proper place. Roberts should reject the great temptation and remember a fundamental truth -- the chief's institution needs the chief's originalism. No other course of action will calm debate. No other course of action will preserve the legitimacy of the court. The court's political calculations are a cause of, not the solution to, America's great political divide.",597,nationalreview.com,The Temptation of John Roberts
"President Donald Trump welcomes 2018 NCAA FCS College Football Champions, The North Dakota State Bison, to the White House in Washington, Monday. (Associated Press)

President Trump invited the North Dakota State Bison, the seven-time NCAA Football Championship Subdivision winners, to the White House Monday, and once again rolled out a menu of a few of his favorite fast-food dishes.

The president reportedly served the young men a buffet of McDonald's hamburgers -- same as he did when he hosted National Champion winners, the Clemson Tigers, in January. However, this time he added fan-favorite Chick-fil-A to the mix, with a selection of what appeared to be chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets and the fast-food chain's signature sauces.

The Bison reportedly approached the trip as a team bonding experience.

The grub came from Chick-fil-A, McDonald's and Domino's, and team members were lauded by the president before they dug in.

""I know you people,"" the president said in explaining why he was serving up the fast food feast instead of the usual catered White House spread.

""We like American companies.""

The Bisons on Jan. 5 beat Eastern Washington 38-24, for a record seventh title in eight seasons in the Football Championship Subdivision.

Trump invited them to the White House at the request of GOP North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, a multi-millionaire former banker turned politician, last month.

They're the latest championship team to visit Trump at the White House for a fast food chow down.

Trump sprang for more than $5,000 worth of fast food -- among his favorites -- when the national champion Clemson Tigers visited the White House in January during the government shutdown.

Unlike the Bisons, many Tigers' players passed on the invite, including a majority of the black players.",599,New York Post,Trump invites another college team for a fast-food feast
"One: Ohio senator Sherrod Brown has been in elected office longer than many 2020 voters have been alive: He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1974 at age 22. He had graduated from Yale several months earlier.

The local county party chairman, Don Kindt, had been impressed with Brown when he was volunteering on the George McGovern campaign in 1972, and helped clear the field in the state-representative primary. As a candidate, Brown met Democratic state representative Vern Riffe, who had been in office since 1959 and who would soon become the longest-serving speaker of the state House in Ohio history. Riffe was underwhelmed, calling Brown a ""God***n hippie sonuvabitch.""

Two: In the late 1970s, state representative Brown voted in favor of two laws that modified the rules for maintaining voter registrations. One declared that a voter's registration would be canceled if the person hadn't voted at least once in four years, and the bill directed officials to send notices to voters stating that their registration had been canceled, along with a form to reregister. In 1979, Brown voted for a bill that required elections officials to send out a notice 30 days prior to cancellation.

In June 2018, Brown denounced a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Ohio's procedures to purge infrequent voters from the registration rolls; the Ohio GOP called Brown hypocritical considering his past votes. In 1982, Brown was elected Ohio secretary of state, in which office he enforced the state's standards for purging the registration of those who hadn't voted in several years -- but he also took several steps to promote voter registration.

Three: In 1985, Brown's secretary-of-state office was the target of a nine-month state-police probe into illegal drug dealing. Brown reportedly found a bag of marijuana under his state car and asked the state highway patrol to investigate. At least one state-police officer complained that politics influenced the decision of whether to pursue prosecutions. Brown insisted he and his staff cooperated with police and did not attempt to interfere with the investigation.

Four: All of Brown's Senate races have seen at least some discussion of allegations of physical abuse by his first wife, Larke Recchie; there is little indication that the accusations significantly impacted Brown's support among the electorate.

In 1986, the senator's ex-wife sought and was granted a restraining order ""to keep Brown from harassing or annoying her and from 'doing bodily harm.' In a supporting affidavit, she said she was 'in fear for the safety and well-being of myself and our children due to (Brown's) physical violence and abusive nature.'"" She said in a supporting affidavit that Brown ""intimidated, pushed, shoved and bullied"" her on several occasions and declared, ""I am definitely afraid of my husband, that he has struck and bullied me on several different occasions."" In January 1987, the couple's divorce was finalized. Four months later, Larke Recchie's boyfriend at the time, Joseph Recchie, filed a complaint against Brown, claiming Brown grabbed him around the neck, attempted to strangle him, and made threats. Recchie did not file formal charges against Brown. In 1989, Recchie filed a separate police report, claiming Brown broke her door from pounding on it.

(The 2018 Senate campaign of Republican Jim Renacci gathered and posted all of the relevant court documents here.)

In the 1989 interview with the Columbus Dispatch, Brown denied all the allegations, declaring, ""I've never hurt her. I've never touched her."" What's clear is that the relationship between both Recchies and Browns is friendly today. Larke Recchie taped a commercial endorsing her husband for his 2006 Senate bid, but the ad was never aired.

Five: In 1985, Sherrod Brown's brother Charles -- often called Charlie, like the comic strip character -- was sworn in as West Virginia's attorney general. Charles joked that having his brother as secretary of state in adjacent Ohio ""might help in interstate cooperation.""

But shortly after taking office, Charlie Brown was indicted on charges of illegally soliciting money from his staff to help pay a 1984 campaign debt; he was acquitted of all charges. And it wasn't long before Charlie Brown faced more serious accusations: that he had impregnated his former secretary, and that she had had an abortion and had demanded $50,000 to keep quiet. In 1989, Sherrod's brother resigned abruptly in exchange for an end to a grand-jury investigation into allegations that he lied under oath during a child-custody hearing.

Six: Brown's lone defeat at the ballot box came in 1990, when he lost his reelection bid to Republican Bob Taft, the great-grandson of President William Howard Taft. Brown's in-your-face tactics, coming on the heels of reports of the messy divorce and violent temper, were . . . probably unwise: ""The spat escalated into an impromptu face-to-face confrontation after Brown invaded Taft's office with a squad of reporters to challenge Taft's performance as county commissioner. Taft came out to defend his record and the scene devolved into a 'shouting match complete with waving arms and pointing fingers.'""

Taft's media consultant in that campaign was . . . Roger Ailes, who would go on found Fox News Channel six years later.

Seven: Out of public office for the first time in his adult life in 1991, Brown took a job with Ohio State University and traveled to Poland to help educators develop a post-Communist education curriculum.

Speaking about his visit decades later on the Senate floor, Brown lamented the sudden marketing and influence of some American companies he disdained: ""The first billboards all over Warsaw, Krakow, Lublin, and eastern Poland were tobacco -- mostly American tobacco companies but also British tobacco companies. Those were the first billboards up. So as the tobacco companies try to seduce young people in our country to smoke, they have, in some sense, attacked the developing Third World to get people to smoke there.""

Eight: Eager to return to elected office, Brown moved to a congressional district near his old state legislative district and aimed for the U.S. House of Representatives election in 1992. The general-election fight was ugly. Brown joked that the 1992 Republican Convention had been held in Berlin. The previous year, he had referred to ""the Hitler youth in the Ohio Republican Party.""

Brown's Republican opponent, Margaret Mueller, brought up the allegations of abuse from Brown's divorce, a move that many believe backfired. Meanwhile, Brown said that ""a company owned by Mueller's family"" had been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for toxic pollution. Mueller owned one-third of 1 percent of the company.

Nine: Brown believes the 2000 election was ""stolen"" by George W. Bush and Republicans.

""You've got to be kidding,"" Brown nearly bellows, his body arched against the back of his seat, his arms folded across his chest. ""You really believe they didn't -- you honestly believe they didn't steal it?""

The reporter asks Brown if he's still mad.

""Maybe I am angry,"" he admits. ""Maybe you're right, I do get angry. You honestly as a journalist believe those bastards didn't steal the election?""

Ten: In both the House and the Senate, Brown was best known for his impassioned opposition to free-trade deals. In 1993, he organized freshmen House Democrats in opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Representative Sherrod Brown, a freshman Democrat from Ohio who is leading opposition among House freshmen to the pact, said he recently visited a concrete factory in his district and found workers there ""scared to death"" of the agreement. Mr. Brown and several other members of Congress expressed surprise at the poll's results, saying that it contrasted with their mail, which was lopsidedly against the agreement.

""Mail that I'm getting, and everyone else is getting, shows Nafta is going down like the Pizza Hut blimp,"" Mr. Brown said.

(On July 4, 1993, the Pizza Hut blimp had crashed into an apartment building in Manhattan.) In November, NAFTA passed the House, 234 to 200, in a vote that scrambled the usual partisan lines.

He told The New Yorker in 2018, ""I think the President's sentiments are generally right on trade.""

Eleven: In 2004, Brown was named a presidential elector for John Kerry, but he stepped down when lawyers concluded that members of Congress were constitutionally ineligible.

Twelve: On August 17, 2005, Congressman Brown posted a letter on his website GrowOhio.org, announcing he wouldn't run for Senate. This announcement spurred Paul Hackett, who had narrowly lost a hard-fought special House election two weeks earlier, to announce he would run for Senate against Republican incumbent Mike DeWine. Hackett announced his bid in October; three weeks after Hackett's announcement, Brown changed his mind and announced a bid. In February Hackett withdrew and declared that state and national Democrats had effectively pushed him out of the primary: ""This is an extremely disappointing decision that I feel has been forced on me. . . . For me, this is a second betrayal. First, my government misused and mismanaged the military in Iraq, and now my own party is afraid to support candidates like me.""

Brown went on to defeat DeWine, but in 2010, DeWine was elected the state's attorney general. He was reelected in 2014 and is now the governor of Ohio.

Thirteen: As a senator, Brown has cultivated a baseball-loving ""nice guy"" image that is the focus of many profiles, but he's exhibited a familiar hyperbole when defending himself and the Obama administration's policies. PolitiFact rapped him on the knuckles for declaring that Republicans planned to give ""$700 billion to millionaires and billionaires"" and planned to end Medicare, and for claiming his opponent said he wouldn't have rescued the auto industry. He insisted the Dodd-Frank financial-services legislation ended ""too big to fail"" (it did not), and in 2018, he accused his GOP opponent, Jim Renacci, of being a lobbyist while serving in Congress; the justification was a registration that had never been used, but hadn't been officially canceled until after Renacci was elected to the U.S. House.

Fourteen: In 2009, Brown told reporters he was working on a book, a history of his desk in the Senate, which had been previously used by Robert F. Kennedy, Al Gore Sr., Hugo Black, and George McGovern. As of December 2018, he was still working on the book.

Fifteen: In 2011, in a speech on the Senate floor, Brown declared, ""I look back in history, in some of the worst governments we had, you know the first thing they did? Go after the unions. Hitler didn't want unions. Mubarak didn't want unions. These autocrats don't want independent unions."" This comment came as Republican governors in Ohio and Wisconsin were attempting to enact new limits on public-sector unions. Brown apologized the next day.

Sixteen: In July 2016, Politico declared, ""Ohio's senior senator is, suddenly, Hillary Clinton's ambassador to the Rust Belt, her new confidant on trade, her defender when Trump blasts her as a shill for globalism."" Brown told the magazine Clinton and her staff taught him and his staff about statewide reach: ""She was very helpful in teaching us how to engage with more rural small towns."" Trump won Ohio, 51.6 percent to Clinton's 43.6 percent, in the worst performance by a Democratic candidate since her husband's 40.1 percent (which was still enough to win in a three-way race against George H. W. Bush and H. Ross Perot).

Seventeen: Brown attributes Hillary Clinton's defeat in part to the Democrats' not having enough media allies.

I also think it's a narrative in part created by Fox News. This sounds a bit whiny, but there is clearly a partisan media on the right. There's Fox and there's the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which hates deficits when it's a Democratic president and says we'll grow out of them now. They are party cheerleaders and enforcers of discipline. Talk radio too. We don't really have any of that.

Eighteen: More than once, Brown has expressed irritation with the use of the term ""Rust Belt"" to describe Ohio and the surrounding states. ""When you call us the Rust Belt, you demean our work and diminish who we are,"" he declared in a post-2016 New York Times op-ed. A profile piece about him in the same newspaper said Brown will ""send gently worded, handwritten letters to reporters if they use it.""

Nineteen: Brown's hair was considered shaggy by senatorial standards for a long time; a shorter haircut in December prompted speculation that it was an indicator he was considering a presidential bid more seriously. The Cleveland Plain Dealer dispatched a reporter to profile his barber, with the headline, ""Meet the man who tries to tame Sherrod Brown's hair.""",600,nationalreview.com,Twenty Things You Didn't Know About Sherrod Brown | National Review
"President Trump blasts Eric Holder for saying Democrats should 'kick' Republicans 'when they go low'; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'

While the field of Democratic presidential candidates continues to expand, the attorney general during former President Barack Obama's administration announced Monday that he won't be running for the White House in 2020. Instead, Holder said he'll keep battling to end partisan gerrymandering.

HICKENLOOPER THE LATEST DEMOCRAT TO JUMP INTO 2020 RACE

""Though I will not run for president in 2020, I will continue to fight for the future of our country through the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its affiliates,"" Holder wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.

He emphasized that his party's top priority is to make ""sure a Democratic president is sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021. I will do my part to help make that possible, while leading an effort to ensure fairness in our democracy.""

Holder's visit last June to New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary, sparked speculation that he was mulling a presidential bid. He headlined ""Politics and Eggs,"" a speaking series that's a must stop for White House hopefuls. At the time, he said he'd make a decision on a presidential campaign early in 2019.

Speaking with Fox News and other news organizations after his speech, he openly entertained what a matchup would look like between him and Republican President Trump, both natives of the New York City borough of Queens.

HOLDER VS. TRUMP: 'TWO GUYS FROM QUEENS. THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING'

""Two guys from Queens. That would be interesting. New Yorkers know how to talk to other New Yorkers,"" Holder said with a smile. ""The idea of a challenge, yeah that kind of appeals to me.""

Last month, Holder kept alive speculation about a 2020 bid with a trip to Iowa, the state that votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar.

Holder, who's chaired the National Democratic Redistricting Committee the past couple of years, highlighted that ""with state legislatures set to begin drawing new voting districts in 2021, what happens in those races over the next two years will shape the next decade of our politics. Our fight to end gerrymandering is about electing leaders who actually work for the interests of the people they are supposed to represent.""

And he vowed that ""I will do everything I can to ensure that the next Democratic president is not hobbled by a House of Representatives pulled to the extremes by members from gerrymandered districts.""

Holder urged that Democrats should choose their next presidential nominee based on the candidates' vision for the nation, integrity, the capacity to handle the demands of the Oval Office, experience and inspiration.

And the 68-year-old Holder added that age should not be an issue.

""In evaluating potential nominees, we should remember that creativity is not limited to the young, nor wisdom to those who are older. We must measure our candidates not by their age, but by the vitality of their ideas,"" he said.

Holder urged that the party's nominee work to ""reconstruct the Voting Rights Act to ensure that every American has a full and equal say in our democracy. This is the defining civil rights issue of our time. I know there will be disagreements during this primary season -- and I will not be shy about sharing my thoughts.""

As Holder announced he wouldn't run, former two-term Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper launched a presidential campaign. Last Friday, two-term Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee announced his candidacy.

Both candidates face long-shot bids against a number of higher-profile contenders such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama, is also running, as are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A number other Democrats are moving toward White House bids, including former Vice President Joe Biden, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California.",601,Fox News,Holder announces he won't run for president in 2020
"Last month, Gucci caused an outrage when an image of a ""blackface"" turtleneck -- a black balaclava with big red lips outlining the model's mouth -- went viral on Instagram, prompting prominent African-American celebrities, including 50 Cent and Spike Lee, to boycott the brand.

Barely two weeks later, Burberry made headlines when it sent a hoodie with a noose around the neck down the runway. When a model walking in the show reported that the noose left her ""extremely triggered"" -- not just because of the suicide connotations, but also lynching -- Burberry allegedly brushed it off with, ""It's fashion.""

That's not all: Back in December, Prada peddled monkey accessories that looked like golliwogs, racist minstrel dolls popular in the late 19th century. And in November, Dolce & Gabbana released a series of video ads featuring an Asian model struggling to eat pizza and spaghetti with chopsticks -- and mispronouncing the Italian label's name in an exaggerated Chinese accent.

""The fashion industry has a huge problem with racism ... going back to the foundation of these brands,"" Tansy Hoskins, author of ""Stitched Up,"" tells The Post. For example, she says, in the 1940s, Chanel and Dior famously cooperated with Nazi and Vichy governments, respectively.

Still, she's somewhat shocked by the recent scandals.

""A few years ago, the [racism in fashion] conversation was around cultural appropriation"" -- think models in Native American headdresses -- she says. Now, ""it's more overt. It does feel more extreme.""

All these brands have since apologized -- some with more humility than others. Prada and Gucci have implemented diversity councils and education programs to prevent further missteps, and Burberry plans to as well. Yet the frequency of such mishaps begs the question: With fashion companies more global than ever before, how does this keep happening?

For one, the rise of social media -- and call-out culture -- makes it more difficult for brands to brush off these kinds of scandals.

""Before, you had to be in the right place -- in New York or in the fashion industry at a show -- to see these images,"" says historian Jonathan Square, who specializes in fashion and visual culture of the African Diaspora. ""But now someone on their sofa in Omaha can take an Instagram screenshot and share it with their network, and it will go viral.""

""I'd like to think that it's ignorance,"" says Kimberly Jenkins, who teaches fashion history and theory at Parsons and who works specifically with issues of fashion, race and justice. Jenkins was tapped by Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri to give its Milan team diversity training in the aftermath of the blackface blunder.

""It's a lot of ignorance and people not growing up in a space where there's a whole lot of diversity,"" Jenkins says of the experience, adding that while Italy is a nation full of immigrants, the fashion houses there tend to be uniformly white.

""[The people at Gucci] don't understand the meaning behind these images and how damaging they are,"" she says, adding during her time in Milan for the diversity training she saw multiple blackface figurines in restaurants and cafes.

""Italy is less well-versed in the visual language of racism"" than the US is, says Square. ""In an American context, our knee-jerk reaction is to associate blackface with Jim Crow racism, [while] .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. Italy had no direct involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and never instituted plantation economies supported by racialized slavery."" Still, he stresses that blackface and minstrelsy was a global phenomenon.

Marketing exec Aliza Licht says that it's not just a lack of diversity, or understanding of diversity, that leads to such clueless products. Rather, she says many of these design teams are staffed by yes-men who won't challenge a designer if he or she comes up with something questionable.

""A lot of times, especially in fashion, there is a reluctance to push back,"" she says. ""Everyone around the creative director is like, 'Fabulous, I love it.' And it will be 3 in the morning and the show's a day from now, and it's like, 'We just need to get this done!'‚Ää""

Yet in the case of Gucci and Prada, the offending products had gone through a long chain of command, landing in stores without anyone waving a red flag.

""I was a little shocked that nowhere along the design process someone didn't say, 'I don't know about that,'‚Ää"" says Square. ""Whether on an executive level, or the photographer, or the model, or the stylist or the web editor -- it made it all the way to the Web site.""

Gucci designer Alessandro Michele, in a letter to the company obtained by the industry website Fashionista, stated that the offending sweater, available in a variety of hues, was inspired by performance artist Leigh Bowery, whose signature look involved crazy makeup and plastic lips.

Without having people of color -- or people steeped in the history of racist imagery -- involved in the process, Jenkins says, ""Everyone just saw Leigh Bowery, without thinking what happens when one of the colors it will be produced in happens to be black.

""Then you won't look like Leigh Bowery, but a golliwog or minstrel,"" she adds.

The same kind of race-blinders allowed Katy Perry to release a shoe, available in black or white, with a stylized face on it. The singer, in an apology letter, stated that the design was ""a nod to modern art and surrealism,"" but in black it reminded certain consumers of minstrelsy.

Some fashion critics don't buy that explanation, wondering if such controversial products are deliberate provocations, designed to drive publicity and clicks -- or even to outright offend.

""I think very often the customer base for companies like Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana doesn't care,"" says Hoskins. ""The shoppers are not really known for progressive politics. People can kick up as much of a fuss as they want, but it drives more publicity for the brand.""

Yet Square says that many of these brands -- especially Gucci -- have very vocal, very glamorous black fans.

""It's very embedded in African-American street culture,"" says Square. Dapper Dan, who brought Gucci to Harlem by designing outrageous garments with the logo, now has his own atelier financed by the fashion label. Rappers such as Gucci Mane and 2 Chainz tout the company in their songs. ""I think that's why [the blackface sweater] felt like such a slap in the face -- almost like they don't respect a customer base who has been giving them free PR for years and made them relevant.""

And that's precisely why certain brands are publicly trying to atone. Gucci met with Dapper Dan in Harlem within a week of the sweater nabbing headlines, while Prada has enlisted black filmmaker Ava DuVernay and artist Theaster Gates to head a diversity council for the label.

Jenkins thinks that any international brand that wants to survive will need to do the same.

""It behooves these brands to cater to their expanding consumer base by letting them see themselves through the models they use and the culture they lift up,"" she says. ""Gucci is open to this already; Prada is open to this. But there's a lot of brands who don't want to have these conversations. I hope that this year will show that they need to be.""",602,New York Post,Why racist imagery keeps bubbling up in the fashion world
"""I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington, but we also need to get things done,"" Hickenlooper said in his campaign video announcement. ""I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.""

He becomes the second governor to enter the sprawling field, after Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) announced last week and is trying to cast himself as a pragmatist who can also take on President Donald Trump. Though as governor Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his record as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a broad field of Democratic hopefuls who are backing ambitious liberal plans on health care, taxes and the climate.

Hickenlooper has hedged on supporting Democrat rallying cries like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal to combat climate change. He once worked as a geologist for a petroleum company and was roundly criticized for telling a congressional panel he drank fracking fluid while arguing for the safety of the energy extraction technique.

It was after Hickenlooper was laid off from his geologist position during the energy bust of the 1980s that he inadvertently started on his road to politics. He opened a brewpub in a then-desolate stretch of downtown Denver that unexpectedly took off. That enabled Hickenlooper to become wealthy by building a mini-empire of restaurants and bars. It also led to him making a successful run for Denver mayor in 1993.

His first term was marked by a series of disasters and tragedies, some of which he alluded to in his launch video -- record wildfires and floods, the assassination of his own prison chief and the 2012 Aurora theater shooting, which killed 12. After that attack and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre in Connecticut months later, Hickenlooper called for gun control legislation and signed bills requiring universal background checks and limiting magazine capacity to 15 rounds.

He backed civil unions for gay couples and signed a law providing them in Colorado in 2013, before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Hickenlooper announced in 2013 that he opposed the death penalty and refused to execute a quadruple-murderer who was on death row. And, as he prepared to leave office and was openly mulling a presidential bid, he ordered the state to adopt California's low-emission vehicle standards to fight climate change.

In the run-up to his announcement, Hickenlooper has repeatedly taken aim at President Trump's policies and personal-style. In a January 31 interview with CNN Tonight, the Colorado Democrat claimed the president has divided the U.S. more than it has been divided in the past century.

""I think, if you look at President Trump, he has divided the country worst than it's ever been divided in its history -- or at least certainly for -- in the last 100 years. You know, my history, both as a mayor, and as a governor, as a businessperson was to bring people together and find solutions to vexing problems,"" he said. ""To -- you know, we brought environmentalists together with the oil and gas industry for methane regulations, the equivalent of taking 320,000 cars off the road. We got expanded Medicaid. We got almost 95% of the population of Colorado now has healthcare coverage. Those are difficult, tough problems. We've been able to get people together.""

Hickenlooper joins an ever-growing presidential field, which including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), all of which have begun campaigning in key primary states such as New Hampshire and South Carolina.

"DENVER -- Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said on Monday he's running for president, casting himself as a can-do uniter who is used to overcoming adversity and accomplishing liberal goals in a politically divided state.

""I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington, but we also need to get things done,"" Hickenlooper, 66, said in a video announcing his campaign. ""I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.""

He becomes the second governor to enter the sprawling field, after Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced last week, and is trying to cast himself as a pragmatist who can also take on President Donald Trump. Though as governor Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his record as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a broad field of Democratic presidential aspirants who are backing ambitious liberal plans on health care, taxes and the climate.

Hickenlooper has hedged on supporting Democratic rallying cries like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal to combat climate change. He once worked as a geologist for a petroleum company and was roundly criticized for telling a congressional panel he drank fracking fluid while arguing for the safety of the energy extraction technique.

It was after Hickenlooper was laid off from his geologist position during the energy bust of the 1980s that he inadvertently started on his road to politics. He opened a brewpub in a then-desolate stretch of downtown Denver that unexpectedly took off. That enabled Hickenlooper to become wealthy by building a mini-empire of restaurants and bars. It also led to him making a quixotic run for Denver mayor in 1993. Campaign ads featured Hickenlooper feeding quarters into parking meters to protest the city's charging for Sunday parking downtown. He won handily.

As mayor, Hickenlooper helped persuade dozens of suburban cities, sometimes led by Republicans, to back a tax hike to fund a light-rail network. He was filmed diving out of an airplane to advocate for a statewide ballot measure to suspend an anti-tax measure passed in the 1990s and allow the state budget to grow. When he ran for governor in 2010, he featured an ad of himself fully dressed, walking into a shower to scrub off negative attacks.

It's all part of Hickenlooper's quirky political image -- he vows not to run attack ads and has frequently made fun of his tendency to misspeak and wander off political message.

Hickenlooper was supported by some Republicans as governor. His first term was marked by a series of disasters and tragedies, some of which he alluded to in his launch video -- record wildfires and floods, the assassination of his own prison chief by a member of a white supremacist prison gang and the 2012 Aurora theater shooting, which killed 12. After that attack and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre in Connecticut months later, Hickenlooper called for gun control legislation and signed bills requiring universal background checks and limiting magazine capacity to 15 rounds.

He backed civil unions for gay couples and signed a law providing them in Colorado in 2013, before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. He announced in 2013 that he opposed the death penalty and refused to execute a quadruple-murderer who was on death row. And, as he prepared to leave office and was openly mulling a presidential bid, he ordered the state to adopt California's low-emission vehicle standards to fight climate change.

The last move was widely seen as shoring up an area that has long created tension for Hickenlooper -- his relationship with the energy industry. Groups opposed to the expansion of energy exploration into Denver's suburbs often complained that Hickenlooper was too close to the oil and gas business, which remains a powerful force in Colorado politics.

As governor, Hickenlooper opposed ballot measures to limit drilling in populated areas. Hickenlooper's successor, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, has been more critical of the industry. Last week, Polis announced he'd pursue a wide range of new policies that would limit energy exploration.

Another potential vulnerability for Hickenlooper is money. As a former governor, he can't recycle donations from prior campaigns into a presidential account, as can the many U.S. Senators in the field. Hickenlooper's political committee raised $1 million during the first two months of the year, in contrast to senators such as Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised more than that amount in the 24 hours after they announced their campaigns.

Still, Hillary Clinton vetted Hickenlooper as a possible running mate in 2016, and Democrats have spoken about his potential national appeal for years. In his launch video, Hickenlooper says, following images of Trump: ""As a skinny kid with Coke bottle glasses and a funny last name, I've stood up to my fair share of bullies.""

Hickenlooper is expected to focus heavily on Iowa, where many Coloradans come from and a state where his low-key, genial approach could be potent. In previous trips, he's emphasized his record and how he can bring warring parties together. During a January swing he stopped by a Des Moines brewpub where a customer asked him how he'd win the primary of ""who hates Trump the most?""

Hickenlooper responded by rattling off his governing accomplishments.

""Everyone yells at Trump, he will win,"" Hickenlooper said. ""You have to laugh at him and joke along and say: 'Hey, this is what I did.'""",604,New York Post,Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announces 2020 run
"Our political parties are meant to mediate between the people and their government. Unfortunately, their current incarnations only stoke the flame of polarization.

Last weekend I had the opportunity to attend a conference on political polarization at Arizona State University, sponsored by the School for Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership (SCETL). A lot of big names from Washington, D.C., and major universities were on hand to offer their thoughts on why the country is so angry at itself.

It was an interesting conference, and there were ideas aplenty about what is causing the mutual resentment plaguing our politics -- the socioeconomic displacement of working-class whites, the increasing atomization of social life, the increasing diversity of the polity, social media, and so on.

My view is that polarization waxes and wanes through eras, and that this is part of human nature. What we today call ""tribalism,"" James Madison in Federalist No.10 called ""factionalism."" It is basically the same thing. Plus √ßa change, plus c'est la m√™me chose.

I'm less interested in the causes of factionalism (Madison gave a comprehensive list in Federalist No. 10) than I am in why it is allowed to flourish in our day. As Madison argued, the purpose of a ""well constructed Union"" is to ""break and control the violence of faction."" Our political system is currently less capable of this than Madison wanted.

A case in point happened on Twitter (where else?) this week. By all accounts Joe Biden is getting set to run for president. His pitch will be as an experienced statesman and ""happy warrior."" That was his modus operandi in government; recall in 2011, after the ""grand bargain"" on taxes and entitlements broke down between President Barack Obama and Speaker John Boehner, it was Biden who cut a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to raise the debt ceiling.

It's a good pitch, and one that -- Biden's ideological judgments and policy preferences aside -- could probably appeal to a wide swath of the country. To that end, Biden recently called Vice President Mike Pence ""a good guy."" Hardly a controversial statement, and certainly in keeping with Biden's style.

Yet it prompted outrage on the left from Cynthia Nixon -- the actress from Sex and the City and unsuccessful challenger to Andrew Cuomo for the New York governorship last year. She blasted Biden for calling ""America's most anti-LGBT elected leader 'a decent guy.'"" ""Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community,"" she told Biden.

This is par for the course for the cultural Left. They are not interested in a truce on the difficult intersection of sexuality and faith, or really on any issue for that matter. ""Live and let live"" is out, as their ideological opponents must be made persona non grata in politics.

This is a relatively unremarkable symptom of our polarized age. One faction thinks the other is evil, and vice versa. You could point to similar groups on the right that want to deal likewise with their opponents. Read Federalist No. 10, and you'll see that this is just the same old, same old. What I found so disconcerting is that Biden agreed with Nixon! ""You're right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign-policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage,"" he later Tweeted.

Why would Biden genuflect to Nixon? The show for which she is most famous has been off the air for 15 years, and it is not like she is widely known among moviegoers for any other reason. Cuomo crushed her last September in the New York primary, besting her by 30 percentage points. Why would Biden, whose reputation is built on a combination of niceness and pragmatism, cave so easily to somebody with such a select appeal?

The answer is simple: Nixon's faction, though narrow compared to the electorate at large, punches way above its weight class in the Democratic primary. Biden cannot afford to offend such a small, but strategically well-placed group before he launches his candidacy.

That leads to my concern about our current form of polarization. We have allowed the angriest, most strident, least compromising forces within our society to have the best position to decide who wields political power. Sure, swing voters in the middle of the country get to choose between the Democrat and the Republican, but months, even years, before that happens, the eventual nominees have to curry favor with the hardcore ideologues.

This is an especially worrisome quality of the presidency, which should reflect polarization the least. If there is anybody who should be above the fray, who should endeavor to see the merits of both the LGBT and Christian communities, and to find middle ground beyond factionalism for the public interest, it should be the president. He is the one constitutional officer we all elect, and he is the one who occupies the ceremonial role of head of state, both of which make him a kind of tribune for the nation.

We should not have a system of presidential nomination and election that weeds out candidates who can serve this function competently. As the 2016 contest clearly demonstrated, the Republicans have no such system. Since he emerged as a candidate for the White House, Donald Trump has alienated a wide swath of the country, and if he manages to win reelection in 2020, it will only be because the country hates him less than whomever the Democrats nominate. As for the Democrats, their nominees have tended to to be quite factional in the postwar era. And as the Biden-Nixon interchange illustrates, the eventual Democratic nominee is going to have to win over the angry Left before he or she faces the general electorate.

This analysis moves beyond cultural, social, and economic causes of polarization in the electorate. Because let's be honest, there is probably nothing we can do about that anyway -- all of the theorized forces enumerated at the SCETL conference are well outside policymakers' ability to influence in a meaningful way. But we do have the power to regulate the power the nastiest among us have in politics, especially by reforming our political parties, which were originally intended to function as mediators between the people and their government. If we are serious about doing something about polarization, I think party reform is where we should start.",605,nationalreview.com,Factionalism and the Cultural Left | National Review
"'We are living in perilous times when the hearts and souls of men are sorely tried. Never before has the future been so utterly unpredictable; we are not so much in a period of transition with belief in progress to push us on, rather we seem to be entering the realm of the unknown, joylessly disillusioned, and without hope.""

Reading this from a 1935 address from Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who would become one of the most well-known preachers of American history, gave me some consolation in the remembrance that perhaps there is nothing new under the sun. Every time has its tests. Will we meet ours, though?

Reading on, Sheen says: ""The whole world seems to be in a state of spiritual widowhood, possessed of the harrowing devastation of one who set out on life's course joyously in intimate comradeship with another, and there is bereft of that companion forever.""

Do people even feel like they have a shot often though today? Do they feel like they ever had anyone who would walk with them? Do they?

A number of recent books and other writings have noted the loneliness in the world today. In his chapter calling it an ""epidemic,"" Senator Ben Sasse writes in his recent Them: Why We Hate Each Other - And How to Heal of happiness as four legs of a chair. ""When all four are in place, things are sturdy. When one goes missing, your happiness begins to wobble."" Those four elements are not breaking news: (1) ""Do you have family you love, and who love you?"" (2) ""Do you have friends you trust and confide in?"" (3) ""Do you have work that matters -- callings that benefit your neighbors?"" (4) ""Do you have a worldview that can make sense of suffering and death.""

During his talk, Sheen continued: ""And in all this confusion and bewilderment our modern prophets say that our economics have failed us. No! It is not our economics which have failed; it is man who has failed - man who has forgotten God. Hence no manner of economic or political readjustment can possibly save our civilization; we can be saved only by a renovation of the inner man, only by a purging of our heart and souls; for only by seeking first the Kingdom of God and His Justice will all these things be added unto us. That is the way the world twenty centuries ago was saved from paganism and selfishness."" He was talking about the birth of Christianity and the need for it to be reborn in the world again by Christians taking it seriously, living it seriously. All I could think about reading it was how everyone seems to be watching politics as a spectator sport today, and investing way too much in it at the detriment of the power of close-to-home virtue.

In another new book, Alienated America, Timothy P. Carney talks about how his community swooped under him and his wife when one of his children wound up hospitalized. Parenthood at its most terrifying became a confirmation that they were far from alone in the world. That doesn't always happen. We're dispersed. We're occupied. We're hurt. We're angry. A few nights ago, as a man asked me for money for a coffee, another man passed by and yelled at him to get off the streets and quit bothering people. Presumably if it was that easy he would have thought of it himself. The passerby wasn't even asked for help, the presence of the man simply moved him to gratuitously kick a man when he's down in the cold. Our other frequent posture is mere pity, as we move along. But is that who we are and want to be?

The first full week of March this year brings with it the onset of Lent, that penitential time for remembrance of what being Christian should mean in lives and in the world. It comes at a time of scandal - as the once point man for reform in the Catholic Church, Theodore McCarrick, is no longer a priest on the evening of his life. In politics, we've seen a celebration of abortion instead of the ""safe, legal, and rare"" rhetoric that wasn't so long ago. As we tolerate the unconscionable in refusing to protect infant survivors of abortion - though according to new Marist polling commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, this new open extremism may backfire on the Democratic party, so perhaps they'll come to reconsider this doubling down on death - many of us rarely look to see what needs are around us, that we can help prevent the next abortion, the next single mother feeling abandoned, the next young man never quite taking flight, that there's a foster child whose forever home might just be your own.

Sheen's address is collected in a volume called The Prodigal World, of course referring to the Gospel parable of the wayward son who comes back into the open arms of his father. He advises that once we have fallen off the wagon of the Beatitudinal way of life, we can come back. ""There is no reason for despair.... There is still some remembrance of the Father's House. Suffice it to say here that some are coming back again to God...by trial of the world.""

As the Senate was in the process of voting down the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, I prayed with some of the Sisters of Life in midtown Manhattan in their chapel as a young mother who they had helped joined us, too, along with her young daughter of about two. The little girl ran a little, showed reverence for Jesus, and settled in with some drawing and a picture book for the time. She's alive because the Sisters wrapped her mother with love during a frightening, uncertain time. That's what we've got to do a lot more of and stop being constantly distracted from hope that lives in love.",606,nationalreview.com,"Our Prodigal World, Country, Parties, and Souls Can Turn around | National Review"
"WASHINGTON -- Declaring it's ""very clear"" President Donald Trump obstructed justice, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, says the panel is requesting documents Monday from more than 60 people from Trump's administration, family and business as part of a rapidly expanding Russia investigation.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the House Judiciary Committee wants to review documents from the Justice Department, the president's son Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former White House counsel Don McGahn also are likely targets, he said.

""We are going to initiate investigations into abuses of power, into corruption and into obstruction of justice,"" Nadler said. ""We will do everything we can to get that evidence.""

MARK WARNER SAYS THERE'S 'ENORMOUS' EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA-TRUMP COLLUSION

Asked if he believed Trump obstructed justice, Nadler said, ""Yes, I do.""

Nadler isn't calling the inquiry an impeachment investigation but said House Democrats, now in the majority, are simply doing ""our job to protect the rule of law"" after Republicans during the first two years of Trump's term were ""shielding the president from any proper accountability.""

""We're far from making decisions"" about impeachment, he said.

In a tweet on Sunday, Trump blasted anew the Russia investigation, calling it a partisan probe unfairly aimed at discrediting his win in the 2016 presidential election. ""I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election!"" he wrote.

Nadler's comments follow a bad political week for Trump. He emerged empty-handed from a high-profile summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearization and Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in three days of congressional testimony, publicly characterized the president as a ""con man"" and ""cheat.""

Newly empowered House Democrats are flexing their strength with blossoming investigations. A half-dozen House committees are now probing alleged coordination between Trump associates and Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election, Trump's tax returns and possible conflicts of interest involving the Trump family business and policy-making. The House oversight committee, for instance, has set a Monday deadline for the White House to turn over documents related to security clearances after The New York Times reported that the president ordered officials to grant his son-in-law Jared Kushner's clearance over the objections of national security officials.

Nadler's added lines of inquiry also come as special counsel Robert Mueller is believed to be wrapping up his work into possible questions of Trump campaign collusion and obstruction in the Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. In his testimony, Cohen acknowledged he did not witness or know directly of collusion between Trump aides and Russia but had his ""suspicions.""

SCHIFF SAYS THERE IS 'DIRECT EVIDENCE' OF COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Sunday accused House Democrats of prejudging Trump as part of a query based purely on partisan politics.

""I think Congressman Nadler decided to impeach the president the day the president won the election,"" McCarthy said. ""Listen to exactly what he said. He talks about impeachment before he even became chairman and then he says, 'you've got to persuade people to get there.' There's nothing that the president did wrong.""

""Show me where the president did anything to be impeached...Nadler is setting the framework now that the Democrats are not to believe the Mueller report,"" he said.

Nadler said Sunday his committee will seek to review the Mueller report but stressed the investigation ""goes far beyond collusion.""

He pointed to what he considered several instances of obstruction of justice by the president, including the ""1,100 times he referred to the Mueller investigation as a 'witch hunt'"" as well Trump's abrupt firing of FBI director James Comey in 2017. According to Comey, Trump had encouraged the then-FBI director to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has denied he told Comey to end the Flynn probe.

""It's very clear that the president obstructed justice,"" Nadler said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has kept calls for impeachment at bay by insisting that Mueller first must be allowed to finish his work, and present his findings publicly -- though it's unclear whether the White House will allow its full release.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who chairs the House intelligence committee, on Sunday also stressed that it's too early to make judgments about impeachment.

""That is something that we will have to await Bob Mueller's report and the underlying evidence to determine. We will also have to look at the whole body of improper and criminal actions by the president including those campaign finance crimes to determine whether they rise to the level of removal from office,"" Schiff said.

"TRUMP SUGGESTS COHEN HEARING MAY HAVE LED TO 'WALK' AT SUMMIT: President Trump late Sunday tweeted that the call to have his former attorney Michael Cohen testify Wednesday in front of the House Oversight Committee may have contributed to the ""walk"" that resulted in his second nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ... Trump initially blamed North Korea for demanding too much in sanction relief that would only come with total denuclearization. But late Sunday, he tweeted the following"" ""For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with north Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the ""walk.""

He says it's possible the death toll could continue to rise, but authorities are pausing search efforts overnight because conditions are too dangerous in the dark due to massive amounts of debris.

DEMS BELIEVE THEY HAVE A STRONG COLLUSION CASE: On the heels of last week's testimony from President Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, Democrats appear to believe they have clear evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and were stating their case on the Sunday news show circuit ... Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., on Sunday said there are ""enormous amounts of evidence"" linking the Trump campaign to Russia -- the same day House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said there's ""direct evidence"" of collusion between the two. By the way, in his testimony last week, Cohen refuted claims of evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.

Still, more investigations may await Trump. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, who would oversee any impeachment proceedings against President Trump, announced that he will submit more than 60 document requests to the White House and Justice Department on Monday -- a barrage that Nadler called the opening salvo in new and wide-ranging investigations.

The agreement is taking shape following February's talks in Washington, people briefed on the matter on both sides said. Despite the remaining hurdles, the talks have progressed to the extent that a formal agreement could be reached at a summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, probably around March 27, after Mr. Xi finishes a trip to Italy and France, individuals with knowledge of the plans said.

"You hear that from politicians every two years; this time it's true.

The American way of life is going to be on the ballot in 2020. Our free enterprise system, our individual liberties and the universal opportunity offered by this great country are under attack. A wrong choice in the next election could set this nation on a road from which there will be no turning back.

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS COUNTRY IS IN 'FULL-FLEDGED CRISIS' DURING SPEECH IN SELMA TO MARK 'BLOODY SUNDAY'

The 2020 presidential campaign will likely pit a progressive Democrat like Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris against President Donald Trump. The field of candidates includes a couple of self-described ""moderates"" like Sherrod Brown, and it may yet be that Joe Biden or Michael Bloomberg jumps in to save the Democrat party from itself.

At the moment, though, the energy is on the Far Left, courtesy of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her millions of Twitter followers.

AOC, as she is called, has terrorized her Democrat colleagues into embracing one policy after another that would destroy our capitalist economy. The Green New Deal, which requires legislators to dictate not only how our energy industries operate but also what kinds of jobs Americans may hold and what their homes will look like, may seem crazy and reckless to most of us, but it has attracted the support of 11 co-sponsors in the Senate and 89 in the House. All six Democratic senators running for president have signed on. They apparently don't think it's crazy at all.

Medicare-for-all, also gathering support, is nearly as frightening. Backers are either willfully ignoring the well-publicized shortcomings of similar systems in the UK or Canada, or they are too lazy to have done their homework. I suspect both are true.

Representative Pramila Jayapal from Washington, a co-sponsor of Medicare-for-all, recently defended the proposal on NPR, saying that rolling it out in two years wasn't a challenge because, after all, Social Security was introduced in a similar time frame. (Actually, it was not. FDR signed the bill in 1935, taxes were instituted in 1937 and the first checks went out in 1940.)

Really. This woman, who supposedly has the chops to serve in Congress, thinks that initiating a program to send checks to the elderly is roughly as complex as a program that kills off the $1 trillion health insurance industry, puts the 600,000 workers in that field out of work, ends all employer-sponsored insurance programs and therefore many, many labor contracts, puts the feds in charge of prioritizing and vetting our health care providers, and sets up the requisite watchdog operation necessary to oversee the vast funds that would flow under the mandate.

In 2020, Trump will face off against someone who wants to toss our progress down the drain and forever change the nature of this exceptional nation.

Will this country turn its back on an economic system that has created more wealth and provided more opportunity for millions to improve their lives in favor of a socialist utopia that has never, ever succeeded elsewhere? Will they break from our free enterprise system at a time when every person who wants a job can find one, when real wages are finally moving higher, when Americans are optimistic about their futures? This is the moment Democrats choose to try to force socialism down our throats? How can that be?

You can thank President Obama.

Obama ignored the working men and women of this country.

After the financial crisis, Obama did not prioritize putting people back to work. He focused on ObamaCare, climate change and on winning the Hispanic vote. He surrounded himself with people like Larry Summers who, to this day, derides our economic potential. Summers' judgement that the U.S. had entered a prolonged period of ""secular stagnation"" convinced the Obama White House that boosting our manufacturing industries or unshackling small businesses was pointless.

As a result, the economy stuttered forward and wages were stuck. Disgruntled workers saw investors reaping the rewards of globalization while their own fortunes steadily declined.

Some of those workers elected President Trump, who promised to revive American industry and has kept that promise. Others bought into Bernie Sanders' politics of envy, believing that successful Americans are profiting from a rigged system that only favors the rich.

The former group will vote to support our way of life; as success stories pile up, we have to hope that the latter group will also vote against the socialist solution.

The Wall Street Journal reported recently on Cassandra Eaton, a young single mom in Mississippi who was earning the minimum wage of $8.25 per hour until a local shipyard undertook to train her as a welder. Her pay has jumped to nearly $20 and when she's finished her internship she'll be making $27 per hour. That's life-changing.

The Journal also told the story of James Wilson, a high-school drop-out who went to prison for selling drugs. Wilson, released in 2013, got help and training from Goodwill, which led to a job as a fork-lift operator in Indianapolis. Wilson has a house and a Cadillac; his life, too, has changed forever.

There are millions of stories like these, which remind us that the best welfare program truly is a good job.

President Trump is a political neophyte, and as such he gets into trouble. But for the same reason, he challenges everything. He asks why we allow China to cheat and steal, why U.S. exporters to Europe are treated unfairly and why we can't use our energy bounty to move the needle in the Middle East.

"Conservative attacked on Berkeley campus joins Trump onstage at CPAC

The mainstream media is having fun covering President Trump's two-plus hour speech at CPAC Saturday. Some are characterizing it as ""profane,"" and others as ""rambling."" Well, I watched it and I would characterize the president's speech as something quite different:

It was the moment I've been waiting for.

During those two very candid, and almost completely unscripted hours, where the president just stood and talked to supporters, one of the most significant moments (and you know it is significant because the mainstream media isn't covering it) was when he brought Hayden Williams up onstage to discuss the recent violent assault he suffered at the University of California, Berkeley.

TRUMP, ON CPAC STAGE WITH BERKELEY ASSAULT VICTIM, PROMISES EXECUTIVE ORDER ON CAMPUS FREE SPEECH

On Friday, February 22, Williams, who works for The Leadership Institute, was helping our organization, Turning Point USA, by volunteering to recruit members on the UC Berkeley campus.

In the course of sharing ideas and collecting contact information from interested students, Hayden was violently assaulted in an incident captured in full on video. The assault was unprovoked -- unless free expression is considered provocation on the UC-Berkeley campus -- and directly witnessed by numerous bystanders.

Big universities and big government have been joined at the hip for decades and everyone from administrators to students have been fairly free to attack conservatives without much fear of reprisal. This executive order can change all of that.

It took authorities a week, but on Friday they finally arrested a suspect, 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg, and have charged him with assault with a deadly weapon and attempting to cause great bodily injury.

He should also be charged with a hate crime.

Now, back to our president and his Saturday speech. With the black-eyed Williams standing at his side, the president promised to sign an executive order to address the intolerance and repression on college campuses that is experienced by conservative students and organizations.

This is not a ""both sides do it issue."" This kind of thuggery from students, activists, professors, and administration officials is a product to which team left exclusively holds the patent. It is the exact reason I formed TPUSA back in 2012.

To have the president of the United States commit to uphold yet another campaign promise and address it is an inflection point in the organization's mission.

The issue of discrimination and intimidation on college campuses is something about which I have written two books, published tens of thousands of column words, and have lectured on from podiums all across the country for most of this decade.

From the 1960s forward, the people who are hostile to free markets and First Principles have been using the ""academic setting"" of the college campus where ideas are ""freely exchanged"" to promote only one point of view and to attempt to silence and eradicate the other.

Colleges are the production center of globalist ideas, of socialist ideas, and of general propaganda on anything from climate change to identity politics.

I cannot begin to tell you the number of parents I have talked to over the past several years who tell me that when their child entered college, they seemed to have solid American values. However, when they exited college, they hated everything from Christopher Columbus to the gas-powered engine.

For the president to step in on this and bring not just the law but attention to what is going on within our university system can be a complete game-changer.

Big universities and big government have been joined at the hip for decades and everyone from administrators to students have been fairly free to attack conservatives without much fear of reprisal. This executive order can change all of that.

Since TPUSA started we have experienced aggression in almost every form. We have had universities deny our charters, we have had our students at information tables called racists and other vile terms, we have had our representatives threatened with violence.

We have even had a volunteer punched right in the face in front of a nation of witnesses.

Our marching orders to our students and volunteers have been strict. We do not retaliate. Channeling Socrates, we respond to hate with questions. When universities deny us our rightful place as a campus organization, we work with counsel to fight the battle within appropriate channels.

Yet, with all the gains we have made in terms of campus presence we have still been operating without any form of air cover. The president of the United States is about to send some for us. Now watch what we can do.

There are two things I believe to be true. The first is that most Americans actually know that college campuses are extremely one-sided and are feeding a biased and uninterrupted stream of information to students.

The second thing I believe is that while they know, they really don't fully appreciate just how powerful it has been. It's easy to allow yourself to think that ""This is bad, but kids are smart. They will figure it out for themselves.""

Well, that's the problem. The years spent in college are perhaps the most formative in terms of shaping a person's view of what the world should look like; what is just and unjust.

Under the university theme of collective choices are good and in the public's interest, while individual choices are purely selfish and destructive to others, we have produced graduating class after class that goes out into the world determined to right the many wrongs of the United States.

Do you think Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is an anomaly? She isn't. She's a prototype.

If the president can level this playing field, you will see a change in America that is going to be generational.

At TPUSA, like with other campus-based organizations focused on liberty and free markets, we don't want to indoctrinate anybody. We just want to be free to engage in the world of ideas. We are confident that if given that opportunity, we will win the engagement.

My gratitude to the president for his promise of an executive order on free speech is profound.

"President Trump on Sunday suggested that it was Congressional Democrats and their questioning of Michael Cohen that may have lead to the outcome of last week's summit meeting with North Korea.

In a tweet Trump said: ""For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the ""walk."" Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!""

The summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un was abruptly cut short Thursday after the leaders failed to reach an accord on denuclearization.

Afterward, Trump said ""Sometimes, you have to walk"" away from negotiations when they aren't going well.

The Democratic-controlled House Oversight Committee grilled Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, for hours Wednesday -- the first day of the summit meeting about his time working for the president's company. Cohen made claims, such as Trump approved hush money payouts. Trump has called Cohen a liar.

"In a Friday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour, Courrielche walked through the origin story of YouTube. He how the company came to dominate online video-hosting by essentially permitting widespread copyright violations of shared content across its platform. He drew on his multi-part series entitled, The Virtual Organism, recounting the early days of competition between YouTube and Vimeo.

""The reason why [YouTube] beat Vimeo is they allowed copyright infringement,"" said Courrielche. ""Massive amounts of copyright infringement through YouTube, and the Vimeo guys were very respectful of artists and didn't want to allow that to happen, and so they didn't.""

Courrielche continued, ""So YouTube basically lied about it and tried to make it seem like, 'Oh, we have all these cute cat videos, and that's why we have all this traffic coming to the site,' but once court depositions and discovery happened later, you basically learned that the founders knew that if they cut off all the copyright infringement their traffic would be diminished by 80 percent -- it would go down to 20 percent of what it was -- and so they basically took a risk and said, 'You know what? We're just going to go all out on this to try to get as many users as possible,' and then that's what happened.""

Courrielche went on, ""Google bought them and protected them. This huge company protected them from the entertainment business, and now they completely took over online video since then.""

Mansour shared Vimeo founder Jake Lodwick's warning of how the political biases of technology companies shape their products: ""Jake Lodwick says to you, and I have to read this because it's so great, 'I can tell you for a fact, the philosophy of the creator gets embedded in the creation, that your morality and your values and your crazy ideas, they all become part of the fabric.'""

Courrielche replied, ""Jake Lodwick has been wired in since the very beginning, and he's an amazing programmer. He reminds me of Steve Jobs, a very creative guy. He basically said the reason we need to worry about these tech companies is because their thought process [and] their morals, all of their quirks, the way they view the world goes into their programming, and you see it in the programming.""

Courrielche added, ""So when they're not telling you the truth behind their companies, and they're not being transparent about that, and then they start taking over all of our lives, it becomes this thing where it affects us all.""

Academia's leftism forms the foundation of Silicon Valley's politics, explained Courrielche.

""Most of these major monopolies, if we look at academia and we see what's going on on college campuses -- you just touched on it, how somebody got beat up on a college campus, right? -- that mentality is throughout all of these college campuses. It just so happens that the entire Silicon Valley infrastructure, it comes out of academia,"" stated Courrielche.

Courrielche remarked, ""All of these huge search companies came from Stanford [University]. ... They were the ones that got the very first internet connections. Most of these companies are coming out of that thought process, and then now they're basically having these monopolies, and they can kick off whoever they want, they can change behavior, they can funnel certain accounts, as we learned this week from James O'Keefe.

Courrielche added, ""It's one of those things, now, where people are just starting to wake up to the power that these people have, and that we need to start really thinking about if we are going to allow these monopolies to continue, because they're just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more powerful.""

Large technology companies have usurped the value of copyrighted creative content, noted Courrielche.

""They were basically able to steal all of this content -- this music and film content -- and shift the entire value of copyright from the creators to Silicon Valley and become these monster behemoths that just continue to want to grow and grow,"" Courrielche said. ""[They are] trying to change the laws and trying to change things now to continue to grow. Now they don't want to be just platforms, they want to be content creators. So they're just continuing to grow and grow and grow, and something needs to be done.""

Conservatives must reconsider free market doctrine in the realm of increasingly consolidated power within a handful of technology firms, advised Courrielche.

""It's really challenging conservatives, right now,"" Courrielche assessed. ""Because conservatives believe in free markets and they don't want to have government get involved in private industry, but this is a whole new thing. This is unprecedented. It's a whole new time, right now. It's challenging our thought process on how to deal with these behemoths.""

Google bends search results away from Breitbart News and dissident news media outlets, noted Courrielche.

""I could be searching something [where] Breitbart should 100 percent be the first thing that pops up on Google,"" Courrielche stated. ""Sure enough, it isn't. A lot of times, it's not even on the first page. So they're directing traffic a certain way -- a certain direction -- and, of course, they're directing traffic to YouTube when it comes to video. They're not directing traffic to Vimeo, very seldom are they, even if it's a more relevant search term that should be going to Vimeo.""

Courrielche continued, ""People have to understand, we on the right have to start thinking about this differently, right now, because these guys, they have control, they hate us and they cannot be shaken from these positions, and they just keep on buying [up competition]. Any time a new competitor pops up -- like Instagram -- Facebook buys it. Any time some company gets up big enough to potentially challenge them, they buy them up, so it's not the times of the '80s where people can just fade away.""

Silicon Valley procures political influence in Washington, D.C., warned Courrielche.

""As big as they are right now, they want to be even bigger,"" stated Courrielche. ""When you're that big, the lobbying that you can do in D.C. to get what you want and to keep people quiet, isn't everybody a little surprised, right now, that we aren't hearing our GOP representatives in D.C. screaming about the de-platforming of conservatives and their bank accounts being taken away in some cases? And being kicked off Patreon? Why aren't they talking about that more? Can you imagine that 20 years ago?""

Mansour invited listeners to consult the website Open Secrets to see the campaign donations coming from Silicon Valley's ""massive lobbying arm"" to both Democratic and Republican politicians. ""They're throwing money at both sides,"" she said.

""It's not just the politicians,"" noted Mansour. ""It's the think tank apparatus -- and some of the conservative websites like National Review -- that takes money from these people and then turns around and writes article saying, 'We can't possibly crack down on the monopolistic behaviors of Facebook and Google.'""

Courrielche said, ""I think we're at an inflection point right now. These companies, the size they're getting at, we're talking about trillion-dollar valuations in the case of Apple [and] Google. Facebook is entering into the realm, right now, as well. They're getting so big now that they are able to skirt the Justice Department.""

Courrielche recalled, ""Google, last September, on a day that they were fined $5 billion by the European Union for violation of antitrust law -- $5 billion is an enormous amount of money to be fined by a government -- their stock price went up that day. The market is basically saying $5 billion to Google is nothing. It's nothing, and you know what that tells Google? We're going to continue to do this, because our stock price went up that day, and even though we had to pay $5 billion, but we made way more than that that day when our stock price went up. So it's going to make more sense for them to break the law and continue to break the law than it is to follow the rules.""

""That's why we on the right need to be thinking about this,"" Courrielche said.

If Silicon Valley's increasingly tightening controls over public discourse are not stopped, warned Courrielche, censorship favoring left-wing politics will amplify as 2020's presidential election nears.

""Now they're taking out people -- one by one -- they're taking out some of Trump's most charismatic voices,"" Courrielche explained. ""And by the time this election comes along, we're going to be able to talk about certain things, because we've already sensed it ... they are all starting to tailor and trim back what they're saying, because they're all afraid they're going to get de-platformed and their whole financial business model lies on their ability to reach their audiences that they built on these social networks. I think need to really start pushing on their representatives. They really need to start calling them out and start saying, 'You guys need to start dealing with this and dealing with it, now,' and pushing on the Trump administration, getting Don Jr. to start talking about this more, because it seems like he's starting to catch onto this, now.""

America is approaching a point of no return on the issue of Silicon Valley's consolidation of power, warned Courrielche. ""We really need to start pressing on this,"" he declared. ""Because these guys mean business, now, and they are going to do anything that they can for this man to not be reelected and to put their guy in, and then we'll see how they really start to enforce their agenda.""",613,Breitbart,Courrielche: Time Running Out to Stop Big Tech's Monopolistic Power
"His father wanted a ""post-nationalist"" Canada, but our northern neighbor is less unified than ever.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has attained both rock star status and, as a major scandal breaks that could threaten his premiership, notoriety. Yet despite this fame, he still pales in comparison to his father.

Pierre Trudeau is in many ways the defining figure of postwar Canada. Simultaneously a celebrity and a philosopher king, he is the architect of Canada's modern constitutional order. His most lasting legacy remains the entrenchment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms into the newly patriated Constitution. This charter was the cornerstone of Trudeau's quest for a unifying basis for a country deeply divided by cultural and linguistic differences. But while Pierre is a hero to many Canadians, he also exacerbated the fissures at the heart of the Canadian confederation and nearly tore the country apart. Justin Trudeau lacks his father's intellect and strength of will, but he is inadvertently exacerbating many of the same fissures that his father did.

Pierre Trudeau grew up in a conservative and Catholic Qu√©bec. As an opponent of the right-leaning regime that dominated the province, he became a prominent intellectual, and by 1960, Qu√©bec was in the midst of what is known as the Quiet Revolution, when it rapidly secularized and began to develop an extensive welfare state. The Quiet Revolution also saw the emergence of a new nationalist movement. Nationalism in Qu√©bec was nothing new, but the kind that emerged during the Quiet Revolution shifted away from traditional and religious values towards a secular anti-colonialism. The movement was famously emboldened in 1967 when Charles de Gaulle proclaimed ""Vive le Qu√©bec libre!"" in a speech while visiting Montr√©al.

By the time Trudeau was elected to Parliament in 1965, he had evolved into a clear proponent of individual rights-based liberalism, which he saw as the key to overcoming the divide between English and French Canada. Trudeau's response to the separatist challenge would permanently change Canada's constitutional order. Introducing the Canadian Constitution and ending the British Parliament's amending power over it was the final step towards Canadian sovereignty. In 1982, after two years of contentious and emotionally charged debates, the Canadian Constitution was finally patriated. But this was far from a unifying moment. The draft agreement that eventually became the Constitution Act has never been formally recognized by Qu√©bec, and the events that led to it, known as the ""night of the long knives"" by some nationalists, fueled separatist sentiment.

But it wasn't simply the process of patriation that fueled division: the Constitution that came out of it was just as controversial. As part of patriation, a Charter of Rights and Freedoms was created and entrenched in the Constitution. Trudeau saw the charter, and the individual rights it guarantees, as a liberal bedrock that could create a unifying identity for a divided country. In his Memoirs, Trudeau claimed that ""with the charter in place, we can now say that Canada is a society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based on freedom. The search for this Canadian identity, as much as my philosophical views, had led me to insist on the charter.""

This association of the charter with Canadian identity is a form of ""constitutional patriotism,"" an idea often associated with German philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas. Constitutional patriotism is an attempt to create a basis for collective attachments in which citizens are united by their common acceptance of democratic, liberal, and rights-based values, as opposed to the particularistic values on which nation states are generally based. Habermas also insists that this must be linked to an emphasis on democratic proceduralism and a reduction of politics to largely procedural debates.

Qu√©bec had already adopted a similar charter in 1975. But while the 1982 charter does recognize language rights, its individualistic and universalistic basis prevents it from acknowledging Qu√©bec's collective distinctiveness. That causes it ultimately to exist in tension with the thick pluralism that is at the heart of Canada. Two failed attempts at bringing Qu√©bec into the fold in 1987 and 1992 further alienated the province, and in 1995 it rejected separation in a second referendum by less than 0.5 percent of the vote.

It was not just in Qu√©bec that Trudeau created tension; his quest also helped alienate Western Canada. Trudeau's fixation on this challenge, combined with his centralizing tendencies, meant that many in the west felt that his constant attempts to appease Qu√©bec came at their expense. From the use of transfer programs and energy policy to move wealth from west to east, official bilingualism in provinces where francophones are a tiny fraction of the population, and constant constitutional discussions that prioritized appeasing Qu√©bec separatists, western Canadians had reasons to be suspicious of the unified vision Trudeau was offering. A referendum held on the 1992 Charlottetown Accord, under which Qu√©bec would have been recognized as a distinct society, was most strongly rejected by Canada's four most western provinces.

And yet Canada has survived, and many point to it as a shining example of ""post-national"" constitutional patriotism. The best example of this is Justin Trudeau himself. While he is not the intellectual that Pierre was, he has undoubtedly absorbed much of his father's philosophy. In 2015, Trudeau claimed that Canada might be the ""first postnational state"" and that ""there is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada."" This is the essence of constitutional patriotism. It not only offers a universalistic principle for the polity, it seeks to supplant and reduce particularistic norms and replace them with a universal and abstract allegiance.

But this is largely a myth. The media theorist Marshall McLuhan once claimed that ""Canada is the only country in the world that knows how to live without an identity."" This isn't true. Canada does have a distinct identity, and the ways in which Qu√©bec is often quietly excused from the values of the charter show how hollow constitutional patriotism actually is. Since 1982, Canada has certainly seen the adoption of some of the values associated with that constitutional patriotism. The charter led to the judicialization of Canadian politics, which has created a cordon sanitaire around democratic discourse. Contentious moral questions are now primarily decided in the courts, and the charter has become the preferred mechanism for progressive change in Canada.

Canadians may not quite know who they are, but they certainly know who they are not, namely Americans. Nationalism often begins as a negation, and Canadian culture is full of vapid and shallow anti-Americanism. Just browse Canadian media and it won't take you long to find manifestations of this righteousness, evaluated on the basis of generic progressivism. America has too many guns, it's racist, homophobic, unfair, too religious, too regressive. Canadian superiority stems from the fact that it looks more like Scandinavia than America does.

While this superiority may be loosely grounded in the values found in the charter, it isn't an abstract nationalism at all. It rather allows Canada to see itself as distinct and particular in a way that distinguishes it from its neighbor. Pierre Trudeau once likened Canada's relationship with America to ""sleeping with an elephant,"" and this often manifests itself as a paranoia about American influence in Canada. The president of CBC, Canada's national broadcaster, recently compared the popularity of American Netflix in Canada to British and French imperialism. This isn't an allegiance to an abstraction; it's about having a foil against which Canada can be defined.

But the post-national illusion has been best exposed by Justin Trudeau's relationship with Qu√©bec. Trudeau's government has been rocked by allegations that he ""attempted to press"" his attorney-general to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Montr√©al-based engineering company with a long history of corruption. SNC-Lavalin is facing prosecution that could result in its being barred from federal government contracts for a decade, a major source of the SNC-Lavalin's revenue. While Trudeau talks a tough game on rule of law and judicial independence, the scandal has exposed his double standards. The company has been called the ""crown jewel"" of Qu√©bec, and underneath the largely procedural debate into which the scandal has devolved is the suggestion that were the company located elsewhere, Trudeau would not have been so desperate to protect it.

Qu√©bec is undeniably a distinct place, and provincial governments often try to protect such distinctiveness. The current Qu√©bec government is attempting to ban public servants from wearing religious symbols, cutting immigration numbers, and imposing a values test on new migrants. Premier Fran√ßois Legault recently said that he wants more immigrants to come from Europe. All of this is completely inimical to the values Trudeau claims to defend, yet his response to these various moves has been muted or non-existent. Were another province to do the same thing, the reaction would almost certainly be completely different. When Doug Ford's Ontario government, Trudeau's favorite boogeyman, announced that it was canceling the construction of a proposed French language university in Toronto, Trudeau did not hesitate to offer his thoughts.

The charter patriotism that Pierre Trudeau sought to create was supposed to be universal, equally applicable to all Canadians and all provinces, but its limitations have been exposed by its selective application.

This has not gone unnoticed in the west, rekindling the same alienation that Pierre engendered. The combination of a divisive carbon tax and the stalling of pipeline expansion projects has created a real sense that the west is an afterthought. Talk of the unfairness of Canada's redistributive equalization program has made a comeback, and comments by Legault that a canceled west-to-east pipeline had no ""social acceptability"" to transport ""dirty energy"" through the province sparked substantial backlash.

Pierre Trudeau's dream of a unified Canadian identity nearly tore the country apart. And while the relative harmony Canada has enjoyed over the last two decades suggests his dream ultimately became a reality, Justin Trudeau is inadvertently reawakening old tensions. Justin's legacy was always going to be compared and connected to his father's, and it's fitting that he may be the one who ultimately ends up exposing Pierre's failings.",614,The American Conservative,Justin Trudeau Exposes Failures of 'Constitutional Patriotism'
"Kevin Williamson rants about the Sanders he prefers to see and not the one who really exists.

What's convenient about reading Kevin Williamson is that one can always figure out who the good and bad guys are. The goodies are the moderate libertarians who favor lots of immigration, especially from Third World countries, and who happily dump on those whom they consider to be ""white racists."" The baddies, predictably, are the ""populists,"" both Left and Right, who favor more restrictionist immigration policies.

In a recent column entitled, ""What Bernie Sanders shares with Trump -- and Mussolini,"" Williamson dwells on the common ground supposedly shared by the right-wing populist Trump and the left-wing populist Sanders. Both see trade ""as a zero sum game"" and oppose immigration, which Williamson regards as a blessing. Moreover, ""Sanders is a man of ideas, he is -- not that he'd ever admit it -- a man of Trump's ideas.""

Sanders, furthermore, ""has complained about guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers,"" and this links him not only to the immigration restrictionist Trump, but also to the even more right-wing Steve King of Iowa, who shares Sanders ""beady-eyed zero-sum view of immigration.""

Like his kindred spirit Trump, ""Sanders has been all too happy to appropriate the rhetorical scheme of the alt-right knuckleheads (remember them?), denouncing those who take a more liberal view of immigration as advocates of open borders."" Moreover like Trump, ""Sanders is an anti-liberal-and fundamentally a nationalist.""

""He is a practitioner of a very old and established kind of politics that would have been familiar to such frankly nationalist politicians as Franklin Roosevelt (and Teddy Roosevelt for that matter, Woodrow Wilson and Benito Mussolini.""

To his credit, Williamson never hides his list of villains. But alas, the genealogy that he's created for Sanders is far from convincing. The European Left and American labor unions long opposed immigration that might have had the effect of shrinking the wages of indigenous workers. The American Federation of Labor supported the 1924 immigration restriction act, and Western European Communist parties after the Second World War opposed the import of cheap labor from the Third World.

Those who took this position were not promoting nationalist causes. They were appealing to workers who were afraid of being laid off or at the very least having their earnings reduced because of imported competition. Since Williamson has expressed shocking contempt on at least one occasion for America's (white) working class, one doubts that he shares this concern. It is, however, one that Sanders expressed, when he made the classical socialist argument against immigration, as recently as 2010.

Of course there's no reason to ascribe to Sanders racist motives for once having taken a well- established pro-worker-position. It is one that he shared with, among others, the head of California's largely Latino farm workers' union Cesar Chavez. Chavez's vociferous attacks against immigrants who had come into the country illegally (thereby endangering the wage scales of legal workers) became so legendary that his picture now graces every poster celebrating National Border Control Day.

One might also question whether all the ""frankly nationalist politicians"" whom Williamson associates with Sanders embraced either nationalism or populism. American populists, who founded their own party in the 1890s, were decentralists. They were also states-rightists who believed that the federal government had arrogated to itself too much power. An American Populist Party, which was founded in 2009, emphasizes the same decentralist principles as the earlier populists, while attacking large corporation and administrative overreach. Williamson misrepresents other things as well. FDR and other New Dealers believed in centralized, ""scientific"" administration, which doesn't necessarily mean they were ""nationalists."" It means they were administrative centralizers.

The appearance of Mussolini on Williamson's list is a now widely used scare tactic, by which those whom a writer dislikes are compared to Mussolini or Hitler. Not surprisingly, Williamson has opted for this tiresome practice. I also have to wonder about his justification for saying ""liberalism"" is the natural enemy of ""nationalism."" In the 19th century, liberalism and national identity, as shown in my book After Liberalism, traveled in the same company. Outside of England, which was then the world's industrial leader, most self-described liberals favored protectionism. They also regarded the political unification of nations, as being fully consistent with their convictions. The Israeli historian Yoram Hazoni correctly identifies the process by which freedom and nationhood became intertwined historically.

Perhaps most relevant for these critical remarks is that Sanders has sharply changed the focus of his political message over the years. He is no longer an immigration restrictionist, according to an older socialist tradition. In his announcement of a presidential bid last week, Sanders emphasized leftist identity politics and vowed to fight sexism, racism, and homophobia. His earlier views about immigration, which Williamson views as an essential part of his political persona, was not even present in these remarks.

Sanders, in launching his presidential bid, did talk about free college tuition for all, universal health care, and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, all of which have been his signature positions. But as Tucker Carlson correctly observed, the 77-year-old presidential candidate has become an ""identity politics drone."" In his tirade, Williamson has thrown together Sanders's abandoned stands of yesteryear and tried to force them into a pattern of his own devising. Welcome to the 2020 presidential campaign.

"In this weekend's Wall Street Journal, Chris DeMuth offers essential reading on the meaning of our political moment.

The piece is an excerpt from a longer and equally essential piece in the new issue of the Claremont Review of Books. That longer essay is behind a subscriber wall at this point (and you should quit Twitter and subscribe to more quarterly journals of political ideas) but the case advanced in this shorter piece will give you a good flavor of the whole.

Among its virtues, the piece stresses a key point that is easy to miss in the circus atmosphere of the last few years: that the dysfunctions and distortions of our political life right now result in part from (and also exacerbate) a breakdown of the structure of our constitutional system, which is intended to be at its core a congressional system of government focused on a legislature built for pursuing accommodations in a divided society. As Demuth puts it:

In the wake of the Trump rebellion, we should aim to restore relatively stable political competition and mutual accommodation, inspired by a sense of common destiny -- a more capacious nationalism. That involves a revival of representative government. The legislature is where a nation's multifarious tribes accommodate one another.

I've suggested elsewhere that the chief barrier to an institutional revival of the Congress is a failure of will among its members, rooted in the character of our political culture, which distorts the incentives they confront. DeMuth shows why such a failure might be both a cause and an effect of the transformation of our political culture. He also points to the revival of other key institutions (like the political parties) as essential to a broader renewal of our common life.

He shows by example what it might mean to look beyond a politics where ""pro-Trump"" and ""anti-Trump"" are the only options before us, and to consider the challenges the country faces in terms of the health of our society, the concerns and priorities of its members, and the integrity of our national life, rightly understood.

"Sen. Rand Paul has joined the list of GOP Senators who are abandoning Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's pledge to support the border emergency declaration by President Donald Trump.

""I can't vote to give the president the power to spend money that hasn't been appropriated by Congress,"" Paul told a home-state audience at Western Kentucky University's Augenstein Alumni Center on May 2. ""We may want more money for border security, but Congress didn't authorize it. If we take away those checks and balances, it's a dangerous thing,"" he said, according to the Bowling Green Daily News.

Paul is the fifth GOP Senator who says he will oppose Trump's emergency declaration. His vote will allow Democrats to get a resolution against emergency spending through the Senate with a vote or two to spare.

But Trump's emergency declaration is expected to survive because Trump can veto the Democrats' resolution against the emergency.

Trump is using the emergency declaration to redirect several billion dollars of appropriated funds to help build additional miles of border wall. The declaration comes after the D.C. establishment largely blocked Trump's 2016 mandate for immigration reform. The GOP and Democratic establishments have done little to reverse the rising death toll from smuggled drugs, little to stop the rising inflow of low-wage economic migrants, and little to reverse the chaotic diversity in blue-collar neighborhoods which is being caused by the establishment's cheap-labor immigration policy.

Democrats need support from 20 GOP Senators to get the 67 votes needed to override Trump's veto.

McConnell agreed to support the border emergency and the associated funding for the border-wall, in exchange for Trump's support of GOP's botched 2019 budget agreement with the Democrats. The deal provided Trump with money for just 55 miles of wall, and conditions that allow Democrats to block construction until October.

Trump, however, is pushing hard against Senators who have helped block his wall since early 2017. ""It is a very dangerous thing for people to be voting against border security for anybody, including Republicans,"" Trump said in a February 28 interview on Fox News. ""I really think that Republicans that vote against border security and the wall ... I think they put themselves at great jeopardy.""

On March 1, Vice President Mike Pence told the CPAC audience:

President Trump used his authority under the law to declare a national emergency on our southern border, but now Democrats are trying to stop the president from exercising the authority that the Congress gave him to address this real crisis. So today, we call on every member of Congress. Stand up for border security. Stop playing politics with the security of the American people, and stand with President Trump for a stronger and safer America.

Trump ""has got sufficient funding without a national emergency,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander said after a February 28 speech on the Senate floor. ""He can build a wall and avoid a dangerous precedent,"" said Alexander, who has been a member of the GOP's cheap-labor caucus since at least 2013, when he backed the ""Gang of Eight"" amnesty."" Trump's emergency is ""unnecessary, unwise and inconsistent with the Constitution,"" said Alexander, who is not running for election in 2020.

Several GOP Senators have explained why they will not support the President's border defense plan. According to Politico:

Alexander is just one of about 10 senators who are committed to blocking the president's move or are considering doing so, suggesting the White House has a ways to go to avoid a public split in the party and a Trump veto.

""The president can get way more money than he's even asking for without setting the Constitution on its head,"" said this undecided senator, who requested anonymity to speak frankly. ""I am very, very skeptical about the precedent this makes.""

If Trump doesn't back down, there is still deep reluctance in the GOP to becoming the 51st vote for the disapproval resolution that the Senate is expected to vote on in March. So far, Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are the only Republicans who have said they would support blocking Trump on his plans to seize billions from military projects.

""The question before us is not whether to support or oppose the wall. It is not whether to support or oppose President Trump,"" Collins said, according to RollCall.com. ""Rather, it is this: do we want the executive branch, now or in the future, to hold the power that the founders deliberately entrusted to Congress?""

Other Senators are dodging the issue. According to the Hill:

""I think it's clear that people want to see the final documentation and they want to know the specific statutory basis,"" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who is expected to back Trump. Asked how they would vote on the resolution of disapproval, both Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) demurred, noting that they hadn't yet seen a detailed list indicating from where the White House plans to divert funds.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is also hinting at opposition. ""I have long believed and advocated that every president, Republican and Democrat, should act consistent with the Constitution and federal law, and I'm assessing those legal authorities right now,"" he said.",617,Breitbart,More GOP Senators Plan to Vote Against Trump's Border-Wall Emergency
"A February 27 article in Breitbart News, based on a scoop from Project Veritas, highlighted a new concept, courtesy of our friends at Facebook: The Troll Twilight Zone. (Cue up the eerie music.)

It seems that Facebook censors -- oops, I mean content monitors -- have developed new techniques in their endless quest to make us all live up to their high standards. Specifically, the company's engineers, eager to ""demote bad content,"" have suggested the creation of ""troll twilight zones"" which will ""confuse and demoralize"" said trolls.

To that end, the Facebook overseers have already identified certain trigger-words, including, ""zucced,"" ""normie,"" ""MSM,"" ""Overton Window,"" ""IRL,"" ""red pilled,"" ""SJW,"" ""shitposting,"" ""Kek,"" and ""REEE.""

As anyone who has spent more than 15 minutes reading Breitbart News knows, Silicon Valley's woke watchfulness is as omnipresent as, well, social media itself.

We can stipulate, of course, that certain kinds of content -- most obviously, child porn -- are always objectionable and should have no place on the Internet. So there's a need for some level of oversight, even if, as The Verge recently reported, Facebook treats its frontline human monitors like, well, trolls.

Of course, mindful of such bad human-resource optics, it's a cinch that Facebook will find a way to automate more of its monitoring processes. And since computers and algorithms never sleep, it's just as much of a cinch that Facebook's scrutiny of its subjects members will become ever more thoroughgoing and intense. And the rest of Silicon Valley will soon, without a doubt, catch up.

So, absent some sort of regulatory reform (as Virgil has called for), it seems likely that those who hold politically incorrect thoughts -- and who wish to continue to communicate them -- will have to figure out new ways of communicating.

Happily for the heterodox, there are lots of ways to beat the system, even if, of course, there are also lots of ways for the system to beat you. So it's best to be careful and then, perhaps, be more careful still. After all, one doesn't want to be insufficiently cautious and thus end up in the troll twilight zone, or worse, in a prison camp.

That's what happened to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In February 1945, Solzhenitsyn was a young artillery captain in the Soviet Red Army, fighting at the front against the Nazi Wehrmacht. And yet, appalled by the atrocities committed by his fellow soldiers, Solzhenitsyn wrote a letter to a friend in which he offered oblique criticism of the Soviet regime and its dictator, Josef Stalin. Solzhenitsyn was savvy enough not to mention Stalin directly; he referred instead to ""the boss,"" the ""master of the house,"" and ""the man with the mustache.""

Yet just those vague phrasings were enough to trigger SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence outfit that was more interested in snooping on Russian soldiers than in defeating Hitler. So for his ""crime,"" Solzhenitsyn was pulled from the front and packed off to a Gulag prison camp for eight years.

Obviously, at that moment, Solzhenitsyn needed to be even more obscure in his word choices, although, of course, decades later, he would get his revenge on the communists; he would write of his grim experiences, and those of tens of millions of others -- many of whom did not survive -- in his immortal work, The Gulag Archipelago.

Yet for those who wish to avoid a Siberian fate, there are strategies to keep one's online hand hidden. Herewith are a few:

First, change a few letters. For instance, ""zucced,"" one of those words on Facebook's index prohibitorum, is a play on ""Zucked,"" as in Mark Zuckerberg. Also ""Zucked,"" is the title of a critical book on the Facebook chief, and it rhymes with, well . . . you know. So if ""zucced"" is no longer allowed, the alphabet still offers myriad possibilities for anti-Zuckerbergians.

Second, replace letters with symbols. Examples include ""sh*t,"" and ""a$$.""

Third, slide one one letter over, as a preassigned code. That is, if you shift the letters in MSM over one, you get NTN. (Fun fact: the computer character ""HAL"" in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey was a slide-over on the name of then-dominant computer company, IBM.)

Fourth, assign a random word in lieu of the forbidden word. For instance, in China, freethinking netizens drop in the name ""Zhao"" -- a common surname in that country -- in place of other words that might perk up the censors. Indeed, Epoch Times, a Falun Gong-related dissident publication appearing in the West, has helpfully provided a list of 20 code-words and phrases, all aimed at slipping past the censors; for instance, the Beijing regime's secret police are ironized as ""national treasure.""

Fifth, whole phrases can be ""repurposed."" For instance, the Chinese words ""grass mud horse"" have been hijacked by regime opponents in a way that makes for a dig at the government and a naughty pun in Chinese.

Sixth, words can be replaced altogether by evocative pictures. Once again looking to the wily dissidents of China, we can note that satirists there have juxtaposed Xi Jinping, the supreme leader, with Winnie the Pooh, the cartoon character, whom Xi sort of resembles.

Yet no subversion lasts forever. Eventually, the authorities got the Xi-Pooh joke -- but they didn't think it was funny.

So as we can see, the problem with any sort of code is that censors can crack it. That is, cryptographers, plus computers, can learn to spot the pattern and make the bust. And then, depending on the exact nature of the oppressive regime, the offender can be de-boosted, de-platformed, deported, or even, de-existed.

So that's why dissidents have sometimes had to dig even deeper, hiding not just in coded words, but also in veiled literary allusions and allegories. To be sure, just about every author wishes to make some sort of subliminal point, but hidden political messages have always been important tools of protest against oppressive regimes.

Yet still, even if writers are careful never to mention contemporary politics, they can still get nailed. To cite an almost random example, in 1736, Voltaire, the brightest star of the French Enlightenment, published a play, La Mort de C√©sar (The Death of Caesar). That play portrayed the assassin Brutus as a hero, defending the Roman republic against the imperial encroachments of Julius Caesar. Voltaire's play was anciently historical, and yet the French royal of the era, Louis XV, didn't want Frenchmen getting any small ""r"" republican regime-changing ideas -- and so the play was suppressed. (Six decades later, the French Revolution came anyway, leading to the death of the next king, Louis XVI.)

Skipping ahead to Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, in 1924, Yevgeny Zamyatin published the sci-fi novel We. That novel took place thousands of years in the future, and it was set in an all-glass place called the One State, where people's names had been reduced to letters and numbers, such as ""D-503.""

So one might think that the communists wouldn't have worried about We. And yet the reds saw the parallelism to their regime, and so they stomped on the novel. Zamyatin was exiled, and We was not published in Russia until the 1980s.

Still, sometimes sly commentary makes it through the totalitarian gauntlet. In 1967, for example,, the Soviets allowed the publication of another sci-fi novel, The Second Invasion from Mars, by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Somehow the censors missed the book's derisive reference to an ""angry red eye"" -- a dig at the Soviet reds.

Of course, these days in America, nobody should think that Facebook, monitoring and monetizing our every click, is another totalitarian regime in the making. Or maybe, mindful of what could be looming ahead, we can offer this careful advice: Nobody should say out loud that Facebook is another totalitarian regime in the making.

In censorious times, especially when all data is retained forever, maybe there's already great value in being subtle -- and ironic. So maybe Virgil, anticipating the future squelching of freedom by Silicon Valley, should seize this moment to proclaim how much he likes Facebook.

Indeed, maybe he should be the first to welcome our Zuckerbergian Overlords.",618,Breitbart,"Virgil: How Dissidents Have Flourished, Then and Now"
"After all those years of complaining about Republicans ""marching in lockstep,"" the Democrats have a new program: marching in lockstep.

There was a time, not that long ago, when Democrats used to decry ""voting in lockstep.""

That was a big talking point during the George W. Bush years, with a couple of unspoken qualifiers: ""Voting in lockstep"" was bad when Republicans did it, and very, very bad when Republicans did it while in the majority. That line of rhetoric lasted for a few months, until somebody did some actual reporting and found that the data demonstrated the opposite: In spite of all their humble-bragging about being more diverse and less disciplined than Republicans, Democrats in Congress in fact voted with their leadership more often than Republicans did at the time.

There were some pretty obvious reasons for that: Ron Paul and other libertarian-leaning Republicans often opposed the Bush administration, fiscal hawks voted from time to time against go-along/get-along spending bills, etc. That continued into the Obama years as more ideologically rigid Republicans from safe districts increasingly bucked at the leadership of more moderate Republicans such as Speaker of the House John Boehner. As Ryan Lizza put it in the New Yorker in 2013: ""Boehner has lost his ability to control his caucus.""

There has been a general trend toward more en bloc congressional voting for decades, and the parties have become more ideologically uniform: Republicans still have a number of important ideological cleavages as the culture warriors work to gut the Chamber of Commerce crowd, and the Democrats have been showing some cleavage lately, too, as the socialists grow annoyed with the Democrats who are dumb enough to call themselves socialists in public. But how many real wild cards are there? Not many: Justin Amash on the Republican side, maybe Joe Manchin on the Democratic side. The Free-Thinking Caucus is not exactly a growth enterprise.

But after all those years of complaining about Republicans ""marching in lockstep,"" the Democrats have a new program: marching in lockstep.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is embarrassed, to the extent that she is capable of being embarrassed, by the fact that Republicans pulled a humorous little switcheroo on her. House Democrats were on the verge of passing a bill that would require you to get clearance from the federal government before selling your old deer rifle to your brother-in-law for fifty bucks, and Republicans got a couple dozen Democrats to join them in support of a last-minute amendment that would have required alerting immigration authorities when those mandatory background checks turned up illegal immigrants, who are not permitted to buy firearms.

Keep in mind that this was a symbolic flip of the bird to a piece of legislation that itself is a symbolic flip of the bird: Senator Mitch McConnell isn't going to be letting any Democratic gun-grabbing legislation come to a vote in the Senate. So it's symbolism about symbolism about symbolism, but Madame Speaker flipped her wig, anyway. She called those moderate Democrats, many of whom represent districted carried by Donald Trump, into a meeting to berate them. Never mind the quality of the legislation, this is about party discipline: ""Vote no, just vote no, because the fact is a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side.""

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for her part, is a self-proclaimed socialist who apparently is ready to move straight into the Stalinist phase of her political career, promising to organize purges against Democrats who don't do as she says. She's even calling herself a ""boss,"" these days. No doubt she's already looking for her Trotsky.

Writing in Jacobin, a socialist magazine (100 million dead in the 20th century, but socialism never loses its appeal to the worst) James Muldoon of the University of Exeter works to revive the thinking of the Marxist theoretician Karl Kautsky, particularly the idea that ""democracy must extend beyond the state level itself."" To extend the reach of ""democracy"" beyond the public sector and into the private sector amounts to the abolition of private life entirely, putting formerly private affairs (by no means limited to economic organization) under political discipline. That is something close to a working textbook definition of totalitarianism.

The purges that Representative Ocasio-Cortez envisions for the Democratic party already are a part of ordinary life thanks to the efforts of progressives. If it should happen that you have a child who was once photographed standing in proximity to another child who had a look on his face that someone with political power disapproved of, there will be an organized effort to have you deprived of employment and ruined economically and otherwise by whatever means are available, as happened in the Covington affair. The rule of absolute conformity is by no means limited to elected members of the Democratic party answerable to partisan leadership: ""Democracy,"" as they like to call it (it is more ochlocracy) is to be extended into every aspect of life. That is the vision of the Left in 2019: Mob rule under a dollop of ideological frosting.

That a liberal political culture cannot survive enforced homogeneity is obvious enough. The assault on free speech already is well under way, and the Democrats are poised to impose sweeping restrictions on political communication and organizing as soon as they have the votes.

""The personal is the political,"" they used to say. The slogan is intellectually flaccid but no less authoritarian and totalitarian for that. Progressives, once the partisans of ""diversity,"" ""tolerance,"" and social liberalism, have become the partisans of absolutism, conformism, and moral hysteria. Part of that is cynical politics: It was predictable that the same people who championed toleration when they were a relatively powerless minority would discover the attractions of homogeneity as soon as they got a taste of political power. But there is more to this than cheap opportunism: The emerging left-wing fanaticism gives every appearance of being mostly genuine. Genuinely asinine, genuinely dangerous, but genuine.

Poor dopey gawping old Joe Biden apparently thinks he's going to get out in front of that parade, and that the red banners will be furled on his say-so. He is in for a shock. So are the rest of us. ""Voting in lockstep"" isn't going to be enough for these new totalitarians. What they have in mind is living in lockstep.",619,nationalreview.com,Corrosion of Conformity | National Review

""They're pretending that they didn't go to trade sexual favors for money,"" Barr says, rhetorically asking why some women find themselves in men's hotel rooms at 3 a.m.

Interviewer Candace Owens replies by pointing to the women who accused comedian Louis C.K. of sexual misconduct, prompting Barr to say, ""That's who I'm talking about, too.""

She was kicked off the rebooted ""Roseanne"" show after posting a racist tweet about former President Barack Obama's adviser Valerie Jarrett last May.

Speaking in an episode of the ""Candace Owens Show"" that goes online Sunday, Barr holds nothing back talking about race, religion, politics and Hollywood.

She goes on a nasty tirade against Harris, the California Dem who's running for president.

""Look at Kamala Harris, who I call Kama Sutra Harris,"" Barr snipes, pointing to the pol's prior relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

""We all know what she did... she slept her way to the bottom,"" the comedian says, drawing agreement from Owens, who directs comms for the young conservative group Turning Point USA.

""Look at Kamala Harris, who I call Kama Sutra Harris. We all know what she did. ... She slept her way to the bottom.""

Barr also suggests that Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of a sexual assault when they were teens, ""should be in prison.""

""White women privilege"" is the only thing that kept the accuser out of jail, Barr opines.

Moving on to freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Barr declares, ""It's scary that we have Hamas in our Congress,"" referencing the Palestinian terror group. Both pols are Muslim.

Owens chimes in to say that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) openly ""hate[s] Jews."" Barr herself is Jewish.

The crazed comedian tells Owens that she supports the interviewer's ""Blexit"" movement encouraging black people to leave the Democratic Party.

"""I welcome debate in Congress based on the merits of policy, but it's unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,"" Engel said in a statement released Friday evening.

""Her comments were outrageous and deeply hurtful, and I ask that she retract them, apologize, and commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives,"" the New York Democrat continued.

Speaking Wednesday night at a forum at a Washington, D.C., bookstore with fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the Omar said she fears everything they say about Israel is construed as anti-Semitic because they're Muslim. She said that prevents a ""broader debate"" about Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

Some Jewish leaders said she then revived an old trope about divided loyalties among Jewish-Americans when she said, ""I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.""

She added, ""I want to ask, 'Why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the [National Rifle Association], or fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policy?'""

Steve Hunegs, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, said in a statement that he was appalled by her suggestion that Jewish-Americans have divided loyalties between the U.S. and Israel. He said her comment ""continues the unacceptable pattern of the Congresswoman deploying anti-Semitic rhetoric when speaking about Jewish-Americans' involvement in our nation's democratic process.""

Marshall Wittmann, a spokesman for AIPAC, told the New York Times: ""The charge of dual loyalty not only raises the ominous specter of classic anti-Semitism, but it is also deeply insulting to the millions upon millions of patriotic Americans, Jewish and non-Jewish, who stand by our democratic ally, Israel.""

Omar ignited a bipartisan uproar in Washington and at home in Minnesota last month when she suggested on Twitter that members of Congress support Israel for money. Many Jewish leaders denounced her remarks as reviving old stereotypes about Jews, money, and power. She soon apologized and said, ""Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes."" In the same so-called apology, Omar then went on to reiterate her criticism AIPAC, calling their ""role"" in American politics ""problematic,"" while failing to note that the group does not make financial contributions to candidates.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) named Omar to the House Foreign Affairs panel last month, despite her previous support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel and past tweets in which she claimed the Jewish state was ""hypnotizing the world"" and responsible for ""evil doings.""

Earlier February, House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said Omar (D-MN) could face ""further action"" from Democrat leaders if she continues expressing prejudiced views. Asked by reporters about antisemitic statements made by Omar and Tlaib, Hoyer replied, ""Congresswoman Omar apologized,"" adding that ""the real test is the actions on the floor.""

""We need to treat one another with respect and without language that would refer to any kind of interpretation of bigotry, prejudice, or hate,"" he added. ""We'll continue to pursue and advocate for that, and very frankly, if that doesn't pan out, there may be further action we would take.""

"CHARLESTON, W.Va. - An anti-Muslim poster outside the West Virginia House of Delegates chamber falsely connecting a freshman congresswoman to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has drawn strong rebukes from local and national lawmakers, while causing the resignation of a Capitol staffer and the reported injury of another.

The sign, which loomed over a table loaded with other Islamophobic flyers on a ""WV GOP Day"" at the legislature Friday, bore an image of the burning World Trade Center juxtaposed with a picture of U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim congresswomen ever elected.

""'Never forget' -- You said,"" was written over the Twin Towers. On Omar's picture, a caption read, ""I am the proof you have forgotten.""

""No wonder why I am on the ""Hitlist"" of a domestic terrorist and ""Assassinate Ilhan Omar"" is written on my local gas stations,"" Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, wrote on Twitter as the images went viral. ""Look no further, the GOP's anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them!""

On Saturday, the West Virginia's Republican party condemned the appearance of the anti-Muslim flyers and posters.

""Our party supports freedom of speech, but we do not endorse speech that advances intolerant and hateful views,"" West Virginia Republican Party Chairwoman Melody Potter wrote in a statement, which added that they did not approve of the sign and had asked the exhibitor to remove it. No one acknowledged permitting the display.

The group responsible for the display, ACT for America, has been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. Onlookers outside the House chambers Friday snapped photos of the poster and the additional literature.

""Readin', Writin', And Jihadin,' The Islamization of American Public Schools,"" read one of the pamphlets. Another flyer warned of ""The Four Stages of Islamic Conquest.""

A phone number listed for the organization went straight to a voicemail box that was full and could not accept messages. The answering machine message described the group as ""the nation's largest nonprofit grassroots organization devoted to promoting national security and defeating terrorism.""

Many House delegates denounced the group just as the body convened. One lawmaker admitted to getting so mad that he kicked a House door open, which resulted in a doorkeeper being physically injured, according to the speaker of the House. Another delegate grew furious, saying he had heard a staffer make an anti-Muslim remark.

""The sergeant of arms of this body, that represents the people of the state of West Virginia, said, 'All Muslims are terrorists.' That's beyond shameful,"" said Del. Michael Angelucci, a Democrat, his voice rising to a shout. ""And that's not freedom of speech. That's hate speech, and it has no place in this house.""

The sergeant of arms, Anne Lieberman, resigned later Friday. She has declined to comment after being reached by phone by The Associated Press.

Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw questioned how things had gone so wrong.

""We owe it to ourselves; we owe it our constituents; we owe it to the men and women and children and families that we represent to do better than we are,"" Hanshaw told lawmakers.

""We have allowed national level politics to become a cancer on our state, to become a cancer on our legislature, to invade our chamber in a way that frankly makes me ashamed,"" Hanshaw said.",624,Fox News,"Anti-Muslim signs at W. Va. Capitol roil state, draw outrage"
"(AFP) -- Iran condemned Britain¬¥s decision to outlaw the political wing of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Saturday, describing it as ""wrong and irresponsible.""

Britain said Monday it would seek to make membership of the Shiite movement or inviting support for it a crime.

The decision followed outrage over the display of the Hezbollah flag, which features a Kalashnikov assault rifle, at pro-Palestinian demonstrations in London.

""Iran considers Hezbollah a legitimate and legal force which plays an effective and undeniable role in helping its country¬¥s political stability and safeguarding its security,"" the foreign ministry said on its website.

""[It] considers the decision to place Hezbollah on a terrorism blacklist to be wrong and irresponsible and one which will not contribute to the stability and security of Lebanon.""

Hezbollah was established in 1982 during the Lebanese civil war and fought a 2006 war with Israel.

It is also a major force in the country's politics, holding three cabinet posts.

Britain blacklisted Hezbollah's military wing in 2008 but had until now made no move against its political wing.

However, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Monday that any distinction between its military and political wings ""does not exist"".

""This [decision] does not change our ongoing commitment to Lebanon, with whom we have a broad and strong relationship,"" he said.

""'Never Forget' - You said.."" the caption on the picture of the twin towers read.

Meanwhile, the caption of the picture of Omar read, ""I am the proof you have forgotten.""

Omar became the first Somali-American elected to Congress in November. She is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, along with Democrat Rashida Tlaib.

It was not immediately clear who put up the poster, but lawmakers got into a heated dispute over the display. The argument even became physical, leaving a doorkeeper allegedly injured and a lawmaker resigning.

A few Democratic lawmakers condemned the poster and allegedly got into a feud with Anne Lieberman, the House's sergeant-at-arms, ""after she allegedly made an anti-Muslim remark,"" NBC News reported. Lieberman denied the remark but resigned Friday following the allegation.

"Bernie Sanders tells 'The View' he doesn't need advice from Hillary Clinton: 'We have differences'

A former top Hillary Clinton aide took aim at 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Friday, after Sanders said he wasn't really interested in receiving any advice from his 2016 Democratic presidential primary rival, citing ""fundamental differences"" with her.

""I don't know who our nominee is going to be but I am damn sure that beating Trump & getting America back on the right footing is going to require a unified Democratic Party, so crap like this 613 days before Election Day is irresponsible, counter-productive, & sets us all back,"" former Clinton senior adviser Nick Merrill tweeted Friday.

EX-SANDERS SPOKESMAN CALLS HILLARY CLINTON TEAM CHOICE WORDS IN INTERVIEW

Merrill's blast came after Sanders, in an appearance on ABC's ""The View,"" told host Meghan McCain that he didn't think he would be meeting with Clinton for advice about his presidential bid.

""I suspect not,"" Sanders said. ""She has not called me.""

Sanders then explained that while he respects Clinton, they don't exactly agree on a variety of issues.

""We have differences, you know, Hillary has played a very important role in modern American politics,"" he said.

McCain reiterated, ""So you're not interested in any advice from her?""

""I think not,"" Sanders said, prompting laughter from the audience as he stumbled to finish his thought. He went on to say that the two have ""fundamental differences.""

BERNIE SANDERS TELLS 'THE VIEW' HE DOESN'T NEED ADVICE FROM HILLARY CLINTON: 'WE HAVE DIFFERENCES'

Merrill said that Sanders had touted his ties to the former secretary of state when it suited him, and posted a letter from Clinton from 2016 where she thanked Sanders for campaigning for her in the final days of the 2016 campaign.

The war of words is the latest sign of lingering bad blood between the two camps. The two faced off in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, with Sanders running a resilient challenge to the eventual nominee. Signs of trouble emerged this week when members of Clinton's campaign criticized Sanders' use of private jets in the last months of the campaign to Politico.

""I'm not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,"" Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the 2016 Clinton campaign, told Politico.

FIVE THINGS BERNIE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT SOCIALISM

Clinton staffers said that Sanders' use of jets became ""a running joke in the office"" and noted that the use was at odds with his radical views on climate change and income inequality.

Members of Sanders' campaign pushed back on the claims, saying that the demands were in part due to the rigorous schedule put before them, making chartered flights necessary.

""The requests for a charter only came after the schedules were put in front of us. If a less rigorous schedule were put in front of us, we wouldn't have needed a charter and that would have been fine for everyone involved, including Bernie,"" Rania Batrice, Sanders' deputy campaign manager told the outlet. ""Bernie worked his a-- off on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the campaign.""

Michael Briggs, Sanders' 2016 spokesman, went further and called Clinton's staff as ""total ingrates.""

""You can see why she's one of the most disliked politicians in America,"" Briggs said, referring to Clinton. ""She's not nice. Her people are not nice. [Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.""

Briggs added: ""It doesn't make me feel good to feel this way but they're some of the biggest a--holes in American politics.""

"If there was one area of learning guaranteed never to be hijacked by the forces of ignorance, political correctness, identity politics, social justice and dumbing down, you might have thought, it would be Classics.

But you'd be wrong, unfortunately, as we learn from a distressing piece in Quillette titled: How I Was Kicked Out of the Society of Classical Studies Annual General Meeting.

It was written by Mary Frances Williams, an independent scholar from California, with a Classics PhD from University of Austin, Texas, who decided to attend the 150th anniversary AGM of the Society of Classical Studies (formerly the American Philological Association) in San Diego.

Williams went for the San Diego weather, the chance to see the USS Midway, the intellectual stimulation and, she hoped, the opportunity of making a contribution to the debate on the future of Classics.

She left accused of ""racism"", her professional reputation in tatters, and subsequently lost her editing job at the Association of Ancient Historians.

What did she do wrong?

Simple. She made the mistake of trying to speak out against the corruption of the Classical curriculum by identity politics, race-baiting and anti-male hysteria.

One speaker at the conference, Dan-el Padilla Peralta (Princeton University), argued - to much applause - that Classics was a bastion of white, male privilege, riddled with injustice.

If one were intentionally to design a discipline whose institutional organs and gatekeeping protocols were explicitly aimed at disavowing the legitimate status of scholars of color as producers of knowledge, one could not do better than what Classics has done.

Among his proposed solutions to this problem was that white men should be censored by classical journals, which should instead give priority to people of color, and women, and gender-non-conforming scholars, regardless of the quality of their work.

[Peralta] said he had exhaustively searched the internet to try to determine the racial and ethnic backgrounds of contributors to Classical Antiquity, the American Journal of Philology and Transactions of the American Philological Association between 1997 and 2017. He concluded that ""the hegemony of whiteness is everywhere in evidence across the three journals"" -- between 91-98 percent of contributors turned out to be white Americans or white Europeans: ""These percentages remind me of nothing so much as the figures for those intensely segregated suburbs that define the childhoods [sic] and adolescence of my partner; publication in elite journals is a whites-only neighbourhood.""

Williams, though shocked by the anti-intellectualism and lack of rigour in these claims (what if the shortage of ""people of color"" and women published in Classics journals is a reflection not of sexism and racism, but simply of the sexual and racial balance of people familiar with Latin, Greek and classical literature?), decided not to confront this race-baiting nonsense directly.

Instead she began by making what she thought was a perfectly unexceptionable point about Classics being the bedrock of Western Civilization.

1) It is important to stand up for Classics as a discipline, and promote it as the political, literary, historical, philosophical, rhetorical, and artistic foundation of Western Civilization, and the basis of European history, tradition, culture, and religion. It gave us the concepts of liberty, equality, and democracy, which we should teach and promote. We should not apologize for our field;

Williams had three more points to get through after this one, but was never allowed beyond the first.

Unfortunately, I was interrupted in the middle of my first point by Sarah Bond, who forcefully insisted: ""We are not Western Civilization!""

What can one say to that? I didn't respond; but as I then attempted to move on and make my second point, I was interrupted by her and others, and not permitted to finish what I had hoped would be four very brief statements. A member of the audience with no connection to the panel, Michael Gagarin (University of Texas Emeritus) rose, came over to me, and told me I wasn't allowed to speak.

In the hope of making my position clearer -- that race should not be a determining factor when it comes to assessing the value of scholarship -- I said to Padilla [Peralta], ""You may have got your job because you're black, but I'd prefer to think you got your job because of merit."" Admittedly, I was under stress and did not express myself as clearly as I might have done, but what I was trying to convey is that the principle he was advocating clearly didn't apply to hiring decisions -- and nor should it -- because he had got his job on merit, not because he's black. Indeed, if I thought the opposite, and I imagined there was a chance of him saying, ""You're right, I was only hired because I'm black,"" that would have contradicted the point I was trying to make, which is that it would have been wrong to hire him based only on his race, just as it would be wrong for an academic journal to publish an article based on the race of its author.

Padilla [Peralta] did not respond to my point directly. Instead, he let out a whoop of what sounded like triumph.

Afterwards the Society of Classical Studies issued a statement which speaks volumes about where it stands in regard to the defense of Western Civilization:

""Welcome, barbarians! The gates of Rome are wide open!""

We also have a pretty good idea where Princeton stands on this issue. A report in Daily Princetonian, headlined U. classics professor met with racist comments at conference [the Princetonian seems to have an ee cummings-style aversion to initial caps in its headlines], presents a completely one-sided account of the event.

It dwells on the magnificent credentials of its Professor:

Peralta graduated from the University summa cum laude in 2006, having written two senior theses and four junior papers on his way to salutatorian. He has since earned an M.Phil in Greek and Roman History from Oxford and a Ph.D. in the Classics from Stanford, and was a member of Columbia's Society of Fellows before returning to the University to teach.

Perhaps Peralta is indeed the brilliant Greek and Latin scholar that these credentials suggest. But it seems equally possible, judging by his remarks at the Society of Classical Studies AGM, that what has really propelled his career is not the rigor of his scholarship or the depth of his classical learning, but rather his fashionable and aggressive wokeness.

To yearn for more women and people of color to study Classics is a perfectly reasonable and commendable position. But Peralta, it is clear, goes much, much further than that. You only have to read his comments at the AGM to realize that he is now using Classics - and his unassailable, Ivy-League-tenured position within that field - as a race-baiting stick to beat white people with; but he is also adopting a stance which is quite explicitly anti-intellectual.

Williams may not have expressed herself as clearly as she would have liked in the heat of the moment. But it is perfectly clear from her background, her tone, and the context of her remarks that she is simply a diligent and honest scholar defending Classics from a concerted attack by the barbarian forces of ignorance, weaponized victimhood and ""social justice.""

The fact that Peralta's position has been effectively endorsed not just by the Society of Classical Studies, but also by Princeton, Oxford, Stanford and Columbia tells you all you need to know about the decline of Classics at our leading universities.",628,Breitbart,"Delingpole: O Tempora, O Mores!

"Conservative student organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) put on its first ever ""AmericaFest"" after party at CPAC on Thursday night, which turned out to be a successful event packed with young conservatives and featuring special guest appearances from Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Senator Ted Cruz, and Rep. Dan Crenshaw, among others.

AmericaFest, which was facilitated by TPUSA's newly hired chief creative officer, Benny Johnson, appropriately meshed together conservative politics and culture, which even included a ""bread line"" overseen by a cardboard cutout of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as a tastefully-labeled cocktail list.

A few of the selections on the drink menu included a ""Mexico Will Pay For It,"" which would get you a tequila sunrise, a ""Russian Collusion,"" which was a vodka soda, and a ""CRYN' Chuck Schumer"" equated to a glass of wine -- but if you simply wanted a juice box, you could order the ""AOC.""

The TPUSA after party was hosted at the Cadillac Ranch in National Harbor, Maryland, right across the street from where CPAC is being held -- and served as a great CPAC ""kick off"" party for young conservatives attending the conference from all over the country.

""You're on the right side of this, guys -- history is going to remember you favorably,"" said Trump Jr. to the party-goers on Thursday night, after having noted several ways in which the Democrat Party has become increasingly radical, specifically mentioning the ""post-term abortion nonsense"" and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's admitted goal to ""pay people who don't want to work.""

""This didn't exist a few years ago,"" added Trump, referring to the student organization and conservatism in general beginning to take on a new cultural identity, ""Thank you for making me party and making people see what this party is all about.""

TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk took a break from his more formal suit-and-tie look to don a red t-shirt with the words, ""This is MAGA country,"" while the organization's communications director Candace Owens led a crowd of students onto the dance floor.

"At the age of 16, we allow our young people to get behind the wheel of a car. Work full-time. Register as an organ donor. Donate blood. And we should allow 16-year-olds to vote.

Vote? That's absurd, you say. They're still kids. They'll just follow their parents' decisions. They can't get their heads out of their phones long enough to pay attention to politics.

But lowering the voting age to 16 is not absurd. It's actually a completely necessary reform to improve our democracy, which is ill-informed and handicapped by low voter turnout.

Currently, even in wave elections, like 2018, voter turnout is consistently below 50 percent. New Yorkers are tuning out of an increasingly vitriolic and dysfunctional politics.

Meanwhile, our populace is increasingly uninformed on the basic issues of government. A 2017 poll from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center found that only one in four (26 percent) can name all three branches of the government. (In 2011, 38 percent could name all three branches.)

We have prioritized STEM education in our schools at the expense of subjects like civics. If 16- and 17-year-olds could vote, however, schools would have a concrete reason to teach their students about democracy. And students would be able to enact their learnings in the real world, seeing democracy not as an abstraction but as relevant to their lives.

While it's a given that 18-year-olds can vote, this was not always the case. In 1939, 83 percent of Americans were against the concept of 18-year-olds voting. The notion that 18-year-olds could go to war in Vietnam but not vote eventually drove states to ratify the 26th Amendment, changing the national voting age from 21 to 18 in 1971. But the constitutional amendment took over 50 years to happen, led by states first lowering the voting age to 18 on their own.

We need the passion of young people to lead us to a more engaged, better-informed democracy.

While lowering the voting age to 18 was a necessary reform, the overall voting rate has actually consistently declined since the 26th Amendment was enacted. In retrospect, 18 is not the greatest age to start the act of voting. At 18, young people are starting college or jobs, leaving home and not thinking about their communities.

A key reason to lower the voting age to 16 is that it can actually create lifelong voters. By ensuring that young people can vote while still in school, the act will become a habit. Indeed, in Austria, where the minimum age to vote is 16, average voter turnout is 72 percent. Lowering the voting age to 16 in the US could increase the voting rate for the entire country, improving our democracy in the process.

The actions of our elected officials have dissuaded political participation, and structural reforms have precluded voter participation at the scale we would hope to see in a vibrant democracy. But in some good news, the new Democratic Legislature recently enacted a wave of pro-electoral reforms, allowing for early voting and pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and consolidating local primaries. The Legislature should follow by leading the nation and lowering the voting age to 16.

Our youngest Americans, millennials and Generation Z, will comprise 37 percent of the 2020 electorate. In a promising sign, we've seen widespread youth activism since Parkland, mirroring the Vietnam-era activism that lowered the voting age to 18 nearly 50 years ago.

Every single time we see positive change in this country, from the civil rights movement to the LGBTQ equality movement to the recent movement for gun control, young people have been at the forefront. Their blend of idealism, their ability to envision a better society and their unwillingness to accept the status quo always sparks positive change.

"We're not getting rid of it, so conservatives and libertarians need to focus on making it better.

Last week I wrote about the sludgy amalgam of federal arts programs, focusing on the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. These programs do some good work and little that's repugnant. They sprinkle money on too many recipients, which dilutes their effectiveness. They fund lots of things that are going to happen regardless of federal support. Their impact on audiences -- giving people a better arts experience -- is often negligible because so much money is consumed by back-of-house costs, professional conferences, and big grants to consultants and planning agencies.

They're not going away, though. Conservatives and libertarians have tried mightily to eliminate them since the early 1990s. This isn't going to happen. It makes sense for them to make these agencies theirs, or at least make them work better.

The NEA especially gives plenty of money to organizations that are either not needy or in places with deep donor pools. It continues to give a $100,000 general-operations grant, for instance, to the Public Theater's Shakespeare in the Park series. It's the NEA theater division's biggest grant, and it goes to the most famous -- and eminently fundable -- theater program in America, located in Manhattan. Should that program get a whopping $100,000? Of course not. There are many superb theater programs that struggle to pay the bills and get a fraction of the NEA money.

In 2017, Shakespeare in the Park mounted a production of Julius Caesar in which the title character was costumed to look very much like President Trump. Of course, poor Trumpy Julius gets lots of holes in him via the contemptible Cassius and Brutus and a gang of finger-to-the-wind senators, turning everyone's Ides of March upside down. Upper West Siders loved it.

What was the point? It wasn't a serious one. I've seen Julius Caesar a dozen times. The parallels are, to put it diplomatically, limited. Trump and Julius Caesar are both earthlings -- I guess that's the biggest thing they have in common. For the people who staged the production, it was part wishful thinking, part cheap shot, and part manipulating an audience's gullibility. It shows bad judgment that turned the sublime -- it's a fabulous, powerful play -- into the burlesque. Why keep supporting the place with your biggest grant?

The NEA and the NEH each have a $155 million budget, but 40 percent of that money goes to state arts agencies on a population-adjusted basis for them to spend at their discretion. My state, Vermont, got about $670,000, and I'm proud, and actually surprised, to say none of the money seems to have gone to anything I would call wacky. Some states supplement what they get from the federal level with state tax dollars, but Vermont doesn't.

I think, in other states, the biggest abuses of money come from direct grants to artists. The NEA hasn't given direct grants to artists in years, but the states can and do. It's a bad idea, if only because most art is terrible. Not terrible in the sense of terrifying, though some is strong-men-weeping-and-dogs-baying bad. Most of it is banal, derivative, one-dimensional, or, as Mary Poppins would say, ""in short . . . a ghastly mess."" It's not our age. It has always been thus.

I love artists, but the NEA should require states to support established artist-in-residence programs like Skowhegan School in Maine or the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire. These places have histories, standards, campuses, and expectations all pointing to quality. Of course, you have to believe such a thing as ""quality"" exists.

The Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) had a $240 million budget last year. President Trump tried to eliminate this, too. It does some very good work on Native American-artifact preservation, which is difficult to fund from private donors. It also supports aquariums, zoos, science museums, and children's museums in addition to libraries and art museums. Many of its library grants support technology, which isn't surprising, since libraries are technology hubs. The head of the agency had a long career as a museum consultant, so the grants are consultant-heavy.

I was surprised at how dodgy some of the gifts were. I feel sorry for the librarians, curators, and others who have to listen for hours to consultant-speak about their implicit racism via new ""IDEA"" programs -- lessons in inclusion, diversity, equity, and access -- funded by IMLS. Even the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles has to face the music and dance the Diversity and Inclusion Dance, since evidently their docents don't already and need some lessons, paid for by IMLS. These grants, which cover HR issues, not scholarship or content, are part of IMLS's ""Museums Empowered"" program, which might as well be called ""Museums Distracted."" They're expensive sideshows and shouldn't be a grant priority.

Portland, Ore., is in the middle of a nervous breakdown now. Still, I wonder how helpful will be a $107,000 IMLS grant teaching the Portland Museum of Art's staff to use ""the Pomegranate Method"" to ease strains from ""sudden demographic changes, rapid gentrification, a widespread housing crisis and a state of emergency on homelessness, and a significant increase in hate crimes against immigrants and communities of color."" Curators aren't social workers. Many of the IMLS grants support projects peripheral at most to a library's or a museum's core missions.

These agencies' appropriations amount to the tiniest slice of federal support for the arts in America. In Europe, culture, and that means most museums, theaters, symphonies, and opera companies, is owned, operated, and funded by government. There are some exceptions, and European governments are pushing all cultural institutions to raise money privately in exchange for some decision making autonomy. It's government-driven culture and often sclerotic and crony-driven.

In America, culture is a private affair, owned and directed by independent trustees and almost entirely funded by philanthropy. It's a market model and accounts for the vibrancy and richness of the arts here. Yes, the lows are pretty low, but the highs are often the world's best.

That philanthropy is tax-deductible. This tax expenditure is massive and incalculable. It embraces gifts of money and art. Endowment income isn't taxed. Arts buildings are exempt from property taxes. Of course, everyone's taxes are a little higher because of this indirect subsidy. So, federal, state, and local government support for the arts is foundational. Tax deductions for philanthropy outside the United States rarely exist, one reason charitable giving is so pathetic in Europe and Asia. People there expect the government to do everything.

The biggest beneficiaries of federal tax expenditures are the biggest museums, which have the biggest untaxed endowments, the biggest annual funds, and the biggest tax exempt campuses, and usually get the biggest gifts of art.

Margaret Thatcher said ""the smack of firm government"" sometimes was sometimes a bracing, salubrious event. It aroused nostalgic among those Tories who missed both their nannies and the frisson of a beating with a cricket bat at school. It also provoked change. Cultural organizations are blessed in America since tax laws benefit philanthropy with no strings attached. Government is rarely so altruistic.

This is precious. It's one rare example when tax law actually promotes freedom and experimentation without goring some disfavored part of the economy. Giving culture a hand and getting out of the way is fine as an abstraction for the Right, but if the Left doesn't or won't or can't -- their will to power is too strong -- then there's an imbalance. Do people on the right want nothing from these places? If they don't, they're chumps.

I've written about means-testing some of these programs. This will tend to redirect money from the big East Coast and West Coast institutions to other places. A bias toward American topics also makes sense. I would go further and suggest that the best art expresses the best human values. The country is a few years away from its 250th anniversary. Will our museums celebrate our civic heritage or dis it?

Big-city museums in New York, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia own thousands of great works of art that are never shown because of space limitations. They live hidden in storage. At the same time, dozens of museums have collections with big gaps in them, often because their cities got rich too late and missed the best times to collect.

Do we want to encourage museums to ""share the wealth,"" to borrow a turn of phrase from Huey Long? I think Long wouldn't have known a Jackson Pollock from fly paper streaked with dead bugs, but the basic concept of rich American cultural institutions strengthening those that are less rich isn't actually radical. Do we want to use federal programs to encourage museums to make access less expensive? Stiff museum admission fees are a big reason poor people don't go. Making good culture more accessible to everyone, poor as well as affluent, is a national concern.

Conservatives should have a deep interest in high culture. Without a fight, identity politics, diversity, multiculturalism, and political correctness will debase it and deaden it, and that's bad for the country. This isn't big government. It's simply matching expectations with the direct federal grants and other assistance like federal indemnities we as a nation confer on not-for-profit culture.

"New York's premier opera house doesn't do justice to Verdi's political satire.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. The head of state is corrupt and venal. Instead of attending to the needs of the people, he spends his time chasing sex and committing assorted crimes to cover it up. One of his henchmen, who combines the roles of fixer and funnyman, has been energetically assisting his boss -- but is also convinced that he can keep the contamination of his day job from washing back into his personal life. Of course he cannot, and the whole thing ends in disaster. The fish, as they say, rots from the head down.

Now, wait -- before you scroll down to the comment section and start typing furiously -- I'm not talking about Donald Trump and Roger Stone. Nor am I talking about the Clintons, their assorted hangers-on, and Monica. Nor am I talking about the Kennedys and Marilyn Monroe -- though I could be. I'm summarizing the plotline to Verdi's Rigoletto.

To understand this is to understand why the Metropolitan Opera's recent revival of a 2013 production of that opera, though musically spectacular, is such a huge missed opportunity. The opera tells a story as old and tragic as mankind, and as fresh and pertinent as a breaking-news tweet. But this production is set in Las Vegas in the early 1960s -- perhaps the one setting, out of any time and place, that would most undermine its coherence. The choice makes a travesty out of the work.

My old boss Walter Russell Mead pointed out to me that recreating the Duke as a rat-pack gangster, rather than someone at least expected to rule well, robs Rigoletto of its message. How can corruption eat at the state through its leader's misdeeds if there is no virtuous polity to begin with? Or, as a friend put it, speaking bluntly of Rigoletto's daughter Gilda, whom Rigoletto tries to protect at all costs: ""How am I supposed to care about this woman's virginity in Las Vegas? Isn't that why people went there?""

Indeed it was. No city on the planet has spent more time and money convincing people that actions there are consequence-free. ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" was the spirit long before it was the official slogan. And this is the 1960s: the era before Vegas became a family town. At least, such is Vegas's reputation in the popular imagination, and as there is no effort to build up the world outside of the casinos, that's all we have to go on. Forget Rigoletto's daughter -- what did the courtier Ceprano's wife, or any of the other characters, come into town for? As a result of the setting, there are no stakes; no stakes, no tragedy.

If, on the other hand, you paid attention to the music and the lyrics rather than the visuals, you saw the pathos and power of the drama, which demands more serious attention than it's getting. Rigoletto features at least one rape, a murder-for-hire, another (judicial) murder, and a lot of kidnapping. It builds a world in which Rigoletto is distracted from the abduction of his daughter because he's busy (he thinks) helping the courtiers kidnap another man's wife -- something which, it's clear, is all in a day's work. The tensions within the court between this dark and dissolute reality and the air of carefree joie-de-vivre are present -- or should be -- from the minute the short but ominous overture melts away into a party scene.

To be clear, this production is a directorial -- or to put it another way, conceptual -- failure. Each component of the opera, though subordinated to this flawed vision, is as first-rate as a performance in America's premier opera house should be. Vittorio Grigolo, who for my money is one of the best tenors now working, is as energetic in acting the Duke as he is skilled in singing him. Nadine Sierra as Gilda nevertheless steals a scene from him at the end of Act I, vocally and dramatically. Roberto Frontali, in the title role, is less a jester than a fixer, and one who has lost his hair, and by the end his family and nearly his mind, in the service of an ignoble leader. ≈†tefan Koc√°n, as the murderer-for-hire Sparafucille, rounds out a cast of singers who can also act, while Nicola Luisotto conducted the Met Orchestra to its usual gold standard. And the sets, by Christine Jones, are remarkable -- lavish, eye-catching renditions of a midcentury casino that fill the whole stage.

This last item, though, points to the heart of the problem: the producer, Michael Mayer, chose to prioritize spectacle over drama. Opera has had a bad reputation in the English-speaking world since at least the early 18th century, when Joseph Addison spent pages of the Spectator reviling it as irrational nonsense. Addison was a smart man; this was a spectacularly dumb take. The art form started as an attempt to revive ancient Greek drama (which, ancient sources tell us, made heavy use of music). Verdi (who came after Addison) is but one example of a serious composer, a man who adapted, and showed himself equal to, the works of Shakespeare, Schiller, Byron, Voltaire, and in the case of Rigoletto, Victor Hugo. The opera is based on the French author's play, Le Roi s'Amuse, or The King Amuses Himself, set in the court of King Francis I.

But this old charge of nonsense received a curious validation in mid-century America. The closing of European immigration, which had filled the upper tiers of American opera houses with spectators for whom opera was first-language entertainment, and the end of the period when American elites aspired to imitate their European peers, led to a long period when very few audience-members knew the languages in which opera is written (mostly Italian, German, and French). In turn, that created pressure to stage only a very few operas, i.e. the forty or so works in ""The Repertoire"" that are good enough to sit through for four to six hours without comprehending a word, due to their sheer musical genius. And it created incentives to make the performances spectacles -- with lavish, eye-popping sets, costumes, animals -- and neglect the dramatic side of the art. This is not to bemoan cool sets; when they work, nothing is better. It's to decry concepts that make no sense, that look cool but actively work against the spirit or text of the work.

The invention of surtitles (and the neat little screens-behind-the-seat at the Met) started to change all this. People often forget how recently this development came about -- Met Titles were only installed in 1995. They led to a whole new generation of singers who can act and directors who can think as though they were responsible for a play as much as for a concert. But, unhappily, old habits die hard. Visual spectacle is to producers what halfhearted acting is to singers: an old temptation that still recurs -- as it did here.

One suspects another excuse for this pointedly un-pointed production. ""Politicization"" is a word which the Met, whose audience is more politically diverse than heartland stereotypes of uptown Manhattan might suggest, would prefer to avoid. It must be admitted that writers who share the politics of myself and this magazine are often the ones most prone to voice such a complaint. And with good reason: the art world is rife with bad politicization that always seems to cut one way, from the trashy and incoherent Siegfried at the Bayreuth Festival, in which Americans in a trailer park smear each other down with oil, to George Lucas's insistence that ""George Bush is Darth Vader"" and ""Cheney is the Emperor."" Bad politicization happens when a director imposes his agenda artificially on a work. It's preachy, obnoxious, and often corrodes the artistic value of the production in question.

But that doesn't mean there's no such thing as good politicization: attention to the politics inherent in a work. When the commentary is drawn out from a faithful reading of the work, and draws us further into it, there can be nothing to complain about -- even if one does not like the message. Verdi provides fertile ground for those searching for such messages. There's a reason Italian revolutionaries graffitied walls with Viva VERDI, and it wasn't just because his name could be read as an acronym of Vittorio Emanuele Re d'Italia. His first major opera provided the unofficial anthem for the Risorgimento (""Va' Pensiero,"" from Nabucco). His work could be anticlerical (Don Carlo) as well as anti-monarchial. Austrian censors initially prohibited performances of Rigoletto, then called La Maledizione, before it was revised, reset in the ducal Mantuan rather than royal French court, and renamed. The composer ended his life as a Senator, and not just for his services to the arts.

One reason to make peace with, or even encourage, good politicization is to be able to take the good with the bad. For instance, almost every comedy -- certainly including Verdi's -- is, as critics from the Ancient Greeks down to the present day have noted, inherently conservative. (Among other reasons, comedies tend to convey a strongly pro-marriage message.) But there are higher reasons too. Politics, despite its seediness, is ultimately the managing of human affairs; thus, it is not surprising that an artistic genius who observes humanity would have insights adaptable to political life, or even drawn directly from it. And it's ultimately the calling of a producer to help us more fully understand and explore great works of art -- politics and all.

The Met's production of Rigoletto is an excellent example of where engagement with the work as a drama, rather than trying to put on a spectacle, would have been the better move. Certain people at the Met -- and a good chunk of the commentariat -- may well be kicking themselves, if they think of it, that they blew a chance to critique the President with this Rigoletto. Had it been produced faithfully (in terms of spirit, not setting) it would have been read as a veiled shot at 45, regardless of the fact that it was written before his Presidential run. But looking to the past for lessons that will, by virtue of being timeless, apply to the future is not a trait associated with the politics of the President's most trenchant critics.",632,nationalreview.com,'Rigoletto' at the Met
"Director Pawel Pawlikowski's masterful film mounts a subtle, power-packed critique of the socialist phenomenon.

The best narrative art eschews didacticism in favor of subtlety and nuance and moral reflection. The Polish film Cold War, released last year and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, is no exception. It tells the story, inspired by Pawlikowski's parents, of Wiktor Warski (Tomasz Kot) and Zula Lich√≥n (Joanna Kulig), whose amour fou burns against the backdrop of postwar Europe.

Wiktor's passion for Zula consumes him. It haunts him for years after he flees Poland, and drives him to return despite the certainty of imprisonment. Zula herself is a beautiful, broken creature, the victim of abuse, talented but insecure, flirtatious, charming, impetuous, melancholy, who dulls her anxieties with alcohol. This passionate and doomed romance also has a political dimension. Which is why Cold War is not just melodrama. It's a masterpiece.

The film is a subtle but devastating critique of the socialist phenomenon. Wiktor and Zula meet shortly after the end of World War II, when Wiktor is tasked with assembling a musical troupe that will perform folk music for the nomenklatura of the Soviet client government. With his partner, choreographer Irena Bielecka (Agata Kulesza), Wiktor tours the countryside, recording ancient melodies. They occupy what looks to be an old estate -- a ruin of the ancien r√©gime -- where they hold auditions. Among the aspiring dancers and singers is Zula, to whom Wiktor is immediately drawn. Irena doesn't share Wiktor's enthusiasm, especially after Zula performs a song from a Soviet movie. But she relents. Zula joins the group.

Its fate is intertwined with the conformism, corruption, and coercion of socialism. Near the expropriated property where Wiktor, Irena, and Zula reside is a devastated church. The art on its walls has been blotted out. Of one painting only Jesus's eyes remain. They gaze silently and sadly on the human folly before them. During a tryst in the field beyond the church, Zula confesses to Wiktor that she has been informing on him to Lech Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc), a sort of commissar assigned to Wiktor and Irena. Kaczmarek wants to know if Wiktor is politically correct, if he believes in God. ""Do you? I do,"" Zula says. It's a belief that can be admitted only in confidence. Wiktor, who doesn't answer, is furious Zula has been spying on him. But he can't remain angry for long. Not at her.

Kaczmarek is ambitious. After the group makes its debut, he accompanies Wiktor and Irena to a meeting with a party official. The peasant songs and dances are wonderful, this apparatchik says, but perhaps you could add a few numbers on the glories of land reform and revolution. Irena blanches at the idea. Kaczmarek interjects and says they would be happy to make the change. Wiktor, while noticeably uncomfortable, is silent. He seems ambivalent about the world around him, focusing instead on his artistic and emotional life. He conducts the chorus, whose eclectic and intricate folk costumes have been replaced by drab uniforms, in a tribute to the leader of the global proletariat as Stalin's glowering portrait is raised in the background. Irena looks on in disgust from the audience before leaving her seat and exiting the frame. She's never seen again.

Some critics dislike the episodic mode of storytelling in Cold War, which jumps from year to year. What they miss is that these glimpses into an increasingly remote past illustrate the creeping, insidious nature of socialist authoritarianism. Wiktor makes his escape to the West during a visit to East Berlin in the early 1950s. He waits for Zula to join him -- she never arrives -- before crossing alone into the French Sector. I admit I was somewhat surprised at the ease with which Wiktor defects. Then I remembered the Berlin Wall wasn't built until 1961. Communist subjects lucky enough to wind up in East Berlin before that time had a decent chance of reaching freedom. Before the Soviets locked them in.

Wiktor ends up in Paris, where he plays piano at a jazz club and scores films. It is here that the contrast between socialism and democracy is most explicit. The music in Poland alternates between ethnography and propaganda, while France is alive with the improvisations of jazz and the boisterousness of rock 'n' roll. The audiences in Warsaw Pact nations are drab, monotone, devoid of eccentricity or novelty in favor of an ethnicized socialist ideal. In Paris, the music venues are filled with bohemians and servicemen, with men and women of European, American, African, and Japanese descent. However, the uncertainty and turbulence of life in democratic, capitalist nations can be both invigorating and unsettling.

When Zula joins Wiktor -- she leaves Poland legally by marrying an Italian whom she summarily abandons -- she is ill at ease. Zula is the type of person who, prone to extremes of temperament and comportment, would not fit fully in any community. But she is especially unhappy amid the whirl of Paris. Pawlikowski perfectly captures the clash of Zula's psychology with Western freedoms in a sequence where she drunkenly dances to ""Rock Around the Clock,"" swinging from partner to partner until, having climbed up on the bar to dance alone, she falls into Wiktor's arms. Not long afterward, she leaves him once again.

When Wiktor learns that Zula has returned to Poland, he visits his homeland's embassy and expresses a desire to follow her. The consular officer can't believe his ears. ""Why would you want to go back?"" he asks. Why, indeed. Wiktor can't help it. He isn't thinking straight. He is fixated on Zula. The paradox of Cold War is this: The imperatives of private life lead Wiktor to sneak back into a land whose politics make private life impossible. Wiktor does not learn this lesson until too late. But it is not too late for us.",633,nationalreview.com,'Cold War' Is an Anti-Communist Masterpiece
"Scalise calls out Democrats for refusing to hear his testimony on gun control legislation

Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills this week that blame law-abiding gun owners for the actions of criminals and sociopaths.

H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, would criminalize normal law-abiding behavior by stopping gun owners from loaning a friend a gun to take to the range or from buying or selling their firearms to others without first getting permission from the FBI and paying fees.

H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, would take the burden off the government to approve or deny a gun sale quickly. Right now the FBI must deny a purchase within three days. This legislation would increase that to at least 10 days in which the government is open. This is a big deal to a lot of law-abiding people, as there are a lot of false-positives for those with common names.

REP. MARKWAYNE MULLIN: DEM GUN BILL THREATENS TO TURN GUN OWNERS INTO CRIMINALS

This is a major political miscalculation.

All those blue-collar voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin who leaned Democrat before they voted for Donald Trump in 2016 might think the Democrats' lurch left - the Green New Deal, ""Medicare-for-all"" and more - is all just populist pandering to the party's socialist wing.

But they won't think that Democrats who are going after their guns are only virtue signaling to their progressive base. To America's gun owners, this is personal.

Of course, neither of these bills is likely to be taken up or passed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Even if they were, it is unlikely that President Trump would sign legislation that's not designed to go after criminals, but that would only make it more expensive and difficult to buy or sell firearms.

A big reason why Democrats in Congress think it's now safe to go after American freedom is that the mainstream media have spent the last few months saying the politics of guns have changed and that now a majority of the public wants their rights infringed upon.

This is why both of these bills are really only about political posturing for 2020. In their Beltway groupthink, Democrats have convinced themselves that it's to their political advantage to push gun control.

Before getting into that, it's worth noting that if Democrats in Congress did get their way and these bills became law, a future anti-gun president could declare a national emergency on gun violence and thereby shut down the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

The excuse for doing so could be that we need to pause gun sales as we have a ""national conversation."" Such a move would be a clever way to put a lot of gun stores and manufacturers out of business.

A big reason why Democrats in Congress think it's now safe to go after American freedom is that the mainstream media have spent the last few months saying the politics of guns have changed and that now a majority of the public wants their rights infringed upon.

""Over time, the evidence grew more irrefutable that by abandoning gun control, Democrats were trying to placate voters they had already lost, while slighting the voters they were attracting,"" reported CNN on its website in a story headlined ""Why Democrats are not afraid of gun control anymore.""

There is a lot of evidence to show this is a massive misreading of the American electorate. An estimated 30 percent of American adults say they personally own a gun. Another 11 percent say they live with someone who does.

U.S. citizens alone own 393 million guns (about 46 percent of the worldwide total of civilian-owned firearms, according to the United Nations). This means that people in about 50 million households in the U.S. own guns. That's far more than the number of people who play golf (25 million) or tennis (18 million) in the U.S.

A big reason why Hillary Clinton lost states like Pennsylvania and Michigan (each of which has more than 600,000 hunters - to name one way to measure gun ownership) is that she made passing gun-control and nominating Supreme Court justices who would take away this fundamental civil right a central plank in her campaign.

You'd think that Democrats would have learned this lesson when Vice President Al Gore lost his home state of Tennessee in the 2000 presidential election - and with it the presidency - after he made weakening Second Amendment rights a big part of his campaign. Democrats need to understand that Americans love their freedom.

Even if they didn't read ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Democrats should understand that a lot of blue-collar and unionized voters own guns and that no law-abiding person likes being blamed for the actions of criminals.

Not that gun owners only live in flyover country. Increasingly, suburban Americans are getting guns for sport and self-defense. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), for example, has for the past few years been putting out statistics on the ""changing face"" of the American gun owner.

The NSSF's preliminary 2018 numbers show that 49 percent of new gun owners live in urban or suburban areas and that 48 percent of these new gun owners are women.

Gun owners today are hardly just male rednecks who live out in the provinces. Gun ownership is mainstream across America. America's 100 million-plus gun owners are why the National Rifle Association has the sway it does. They are a big reason why Trump won in 2016. They are a big reason why Democrats are miscalculating now by moving against age-old American freedom.

Couple this with the disillusionment of moderate Democrats and independents with the increasingly extreme left wing now dominating the Democratic Party and you see a pattern here - radical Democrats pursuing radical policies are planting the seeds of their own downfall when voters cast ballots next year.

All that, and I didn't even touch on the big lies the Democrats told when they passed these bills in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for example, said on the House floor Wednesday that the bill restricting gun transfers would ""end an epidemic of gun violence in America.""

This is simply not true and absurd. Criminals now primarily get their guns by stealing them or buying them on the black market. These bills wouldn't impact criminals and their guns. These bills would only further burden law-abiding Americans. Gun owners know that.",634,Fox News,Radical Dems threaten our gun rights with bills that misfire
"Do millennials understand the impact of socialism? Reaction and analysis from author Andy Puzder on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Over the course of their adolescence and early adult life, they've watched our political culture descend into tribalism, rancor, and partisan warfare. They've watched our government grind to a halt. And they've watched their elders become so polarized they can't even discuss politics without starting a fight.

While some young people have chosen to get involved or take up activism - particularly on social media - many millennials have chosen to simply tune out. They feel as though their voices aren't being heard, and they've got a million other things on their mind, from student loans to changing relationships. If politics seems so hopeless and unpleasant, what's the point?

STATE OF THE UNION 2019: WE'RE SO DIVIDED WE SEE OTHERS WHO DON'T AGREE WITH US AS BAD -- HERE'S OUR SOLUTION

Such apathy is pernicious; it enables the angriest, most destructive voices in our politics to fill the void as they race to the bottom. Patriotic young Americans who might have chosen to enter public service turn toward the private sector. People stop bothering to vote. And as the exhausted majority disengages, the vicious cycle continues. Our politics become more divided, and fewer young people want to participate - let alone engage with the ""other side.""

But all is not lost!

It turns out that if you can get politically opposed millennials in a room together, with the right structure and ground rules, they can talk to each other in good faith, discover common values, and even work together as friends. I've seen it firsthand, in dozens of Better Angels workshops and debates organized on college campuses across the country.

In fact, millennials often turn out to be far less polarized and dug in than older Americans. They may have strong ideological views to be sure, but they are naturally able to break down stereotyped thinking and consider different perspectives. Sure they are frustrated with the state of affairs - and sure, there will always be a minority of folks who see the other side as irredeemably evil - but the majority of young people want to find a way forward together.

This paints a starkly different picture from the stereotype of college students as intolerant radicals who reflexively shout down ideas they don't like. Yes, the scenes of protest are real - and there are legitimate debates to be had about free speech, hate speech, and where to draw the line - but the hyper-partisans represent the few and the loud, not the many students who speak up for their views but respect those with whom they disagree.

We need to promote cross-partisan dialogue on campus and empower those trying to bridge divides. That is not to say that we should paper over our disagreements, moderate our views, or dismiss the concerns of students who feel persecuted or unsafe. But we should encourage people to talk, listen, and be heard.

"The Washington Post on Friday issued a lengthy editor's note concerning their story about the Covington Catholic controversy, acknowledging that ""a more complete assessment of what occurred"" emerged after its initial story.

The editor's note concerned a Jan. 19 report about the incident involving a confrontation between Kentucky high school student Nicholas Sandmann and a Native American activist near the Lincoln Memorial the previous day.

""Subsequent reporting, a student's statement and additional video allow for a more complete assessment of what occurred,"" the editor's note read.

The note comes 10 days after Sandmann filed a $250 million defamation lawsuit against the The Washington Post claiming its story led to a ""mob of bullies which attacked, vilified & threatened"" an innocent minor.

The controversy erupted after Sandmann, who was attending an anti-abortion rally with his school, was filmed amid a rowdy group as Native American Nathan Phillips played a tribal drum.

Sandmann, wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" cap, stared down Phillips, touching off a national debate about race and politics in the US.

But after the video went viral -- and The Washington Post published its first article -- a more complete picture of the incident emerged.

Video showed the students were viciously taunted by Black Hebrew Israelites who yelled obscenities at them before Phillips entered the area.

The more extensive videos show Phillips intervene between the two groups and confront the students.

The editor's note added that the report included unverified claims, including: the Covington students blocked Phillips from walking, they taunted him and other members of his group, and that the students instigated the entire altercation.

""The high school student facing Phillips issued a statement contradicting his account; the bishop in Covington, Ky., apologized for the statement condemning the students; and an investigation conducted for the Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School found the students' accounts consistent with videos,"" the note continued.",636,New York Post,Washington Post issues editor's note regarding initial Covington

"Two weeks after Amazon announced it was abandoning its deal to come to Queens because of vocal opposition from local officials and activists, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has swooped into the city to tell major financial firms that they won't have such problems in his state.

""Florida is a place where businesses can do well without having to face some of the political hostility that they deal with in other parts of the country,"" the Republican said in a meeting Thursday with six companies, according to his office.

""Our posture here is one of welcoming, not one of demagoguery and prejudice.""

The companies included ¬≠JPMorgan Chase.

DeSantis' trip coincided with the release on Friday of a full-page ad signed by 78 business, union and government leaders urging Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to reconsider his decision to cancel plans to build an HQ2 campus in Long Island City.

Gov. Cuomo, who is leading the charge to win back the retail giant, conceded on Friday that the ad was also aimed at assuring other businesses that New York isn't hostile to them.

""Please don't be confused. We're open for business. If we don't get new business, good night. That's how our state survives,"" Cuomo told WNYC.

He blamed the Amazon defeat on ""local, petty politics"" and ""distortions"" spread by a ""small, vocal minority.""

""We want young people coming here and the talent .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. We are the commerce capital of the country,"" he said.

Government watchdog E.J. McMahon, of the Empire Center, warned that the Amazon ordeal would be noticed by other firms.

""The Amazon fiasco definitely sent a signal, and it's not a good signal from multiple angles,"" McMahon said.

""Governor DeSantis couldn't have picked a better time to work on poaching New York businesses, especially high earners in finance. More than a few will no doubt find it tempting to at least listen to Florida's pitch.""

Cuomo admitted it was unlikely Amazon would return, saying, ""They've given no indication that they would reconsider.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- one of the most vocal critics of the $3 billion in tax incentives offered to Amazon in the deal -- said Cuomo should have consulted more with members of the community in the first place.

""If the elected officials spent half as much talking to the community as they do Jeff Bezos, we might have come to an agreement,"" she said in a statement.

Cuomo's office, meanwhile, said he was not worried about Florida poaching businesses.

"Sen. Hawley spoke on stage at CPAC in an interview with the Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel, in a discussion about the conservative response to widespread viewpoint discrimination by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other tech platforms.

""In the law we have a familiar phrase, it's called viewpoint discrimination,"" said Hawley. ""We have to tell these companies that you can't discriminate against conservatives, you can't discriminate against libertarians.""

Hawley spent much of his speech attacking the ""sweetheart deals"" between big government and big tech. The senator said many such deals gave big tech companies special privileges and advantages, but ""none more so than Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.""

Responding to questions from Strassel over how conservatives should address big tech, Hawley said: ""we should consider amending Section 230"" to strip legal privileges from companies that fail to remain viewpoint-neutral.

Hawley also spoke of a ""concentration of power"" in Silicon Valley.

""Do we want to have a country that is basically run from Silicon Valley, an economy that's run from Silicon Valley, politics that's run from Silicon Valley?""

""Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,"" said the senator."" They should not be able to discriminate. they should not be able to tell us to sit down and shut up.""

Strassel pointed out that the wrong kind of regulatory reforms -- particularly those pushed by Democrats -- might lead to more control over online speech, not less.

Hawley responded by saying that the goal for Republicans crafting tech legislation should be ""more speech at the end of the day, not less.""

""I am not a fan of massive regulations, turning this over to agencies, [or] creating new agency powers,"" said Hawley, instead advising that the approach to big tech should be to ""enforce our laws.""

""Tech companies should have to follow the law. Let's start from there.""

The senator also highlighted how Silicon Valley's control over Americans' personal data gives them even more power, and why control over online data has to be taken away from companies and returned to the individual.

""They collect so much damning information from us,"" said Hawley, who also expressed concern that tech companies are ""building profiles on our children.""

""We need to give people control of their own information. We as conservatives believe in property rights.""

Hawley argued that individual sovereignty over personal information should be written into law. American citizens, said Hawley, should have a ""property right to their own information,"" and ""if they want to get it back, they should be able to get it back.""

Japhet's company, MyHeritage, sells cheek swabs to people interested in their family history. ... But Japhet wasn't satisfied with only testing the living; he wanted to test the dead. Which brings us to the love letters -- or really, the envelopes they came in. The envelopes were sealed by his grandmother, and the stamps on them presumably licked by her. ... Then he made the big announcement: MyHeritage would soon begin offering DNA testing on old stamps and envelopes. He didn't stop there. If you can test the letters of your grandmother, why not that of historical figures? Japhet is a prodigious collector of autographs, and he revealed that he possessed handwritten letters from Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill. In an intriguing if provocative PR move, he promised that 'their DNA is coming to MyHeritage very, very soon.'""

WARMBIER'S PARENTS REJECT TRUMP'S EXCUSES FOR KIM

WaPo: ""The parents of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died after being detained for 17 months in North Korea, on Friday directly blamed leader Kim Jong Un for their son's death a day after President Trump said he believed Kim's account that he was not responsible. 'We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out,' Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a statement. 'Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuse or lavish praise can change that.' Trump said at a news conference in Hanoi that Kim felt 'very badly' about Otto Warmbier's death in 2017, several days after being released in a coma from captivity in North Korea.""

Report: Trump cut corners to get son-in-law clearance - NYT: ""President Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White House's top lawyer, four people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Trump's decision in May so troubled senior administration officials that at least one, the White House chief of staff at the time, John F. Kelly, wrote a contemporaneous internal memo about how he had been 'ordered' to give Mr. Kushner the top-secret clearance. The White House counsel at the time, Donald F. McGahn II, also wrote an internal memo outlining the concerns that had been raised about Mr. Kushner -- including by the C.I.A. -- and how Mr. McGahn had recommended that he not be given a top-secret clearance.""

TROUBLED TIMES FOR TRUMP SUPER PAC

Politico: ""President Donald Trump wants to raise $1 billion for his reelection. But his top advisers worry that the super PAC at the center of that effort is hurting, lacking a high-wattage leader who can cajole millionaire and billionaire donors to fork over huge sums. Trump political aides, members of the president's family, and top Republicans have been considering potential candidates to spearhead America First Action's 2020 fundraising efforts. They want someone with deep ties to the president and the clubby world of major GOP donors. But the nationwide search has so far come up empty. Super PAC organizers at one point came up with a roster of around two-dozen names that included Robert Kraft, who was never seriously considered but was quashed anyway after the New England Patriots owner -- a fixture at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort -- was charged with soliciting prostitution. Another person floated for the post was GOP benefactor Kelly Craft, but she was ruled out after being nominated for United Nations ambassador.""

HOUSE DEMS' FRAYING COALITION

Roll Call: ""The new House Democratic majority is having its first major family disagreement as the caucus struggles to stay united against Republican messaging votes, which the minority is deploying through a procedural move known as a motion to recommit. Republicans in their first two months in the minority have already won two motions to recommit because of Democratic defections. Not once during the past eight years in which Republicans held the majority did Democrats win a motion to recommit. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, known for her ability to keep her caucus together, is frustrated that her party is allowing Republicans to leverage the procedural tool as a political weapon. ... A motion to recommit, or MTR, is one of the few procedural tools the minority party has to get its message across. While the procedure can be used in a way that actually makes substantive changes to legislation, most often the minority's goal is to send a political message, not improve the bill. That's why Pelosi has dismissed the MTR votes as inconsequential.""

Moderates clap back on Ocasio-Cortez's 'list' - Fox News: ""After more than two dozen moderate Democrats broke from their party's progressive wing and sided with Republicans on a legislative amendment Wednesday, New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reportedly sounded the alarm in a closed-door meeting Thursday and said those Democrats were 'putting themselves on a list.' ... She said she would help progressive activists unseat those moderates in their districts in the 2020 elections, the report said. Her spokesman Corbin Trent told the paper that she made the 'list' comment during the meeting. 'She said that when activists ask her why she had to vote for a gun safety bill that also further empowers an agency that forcibly injects kids with psychotropic drugs, they're going to want a list of names and she's going to give it to them,' Trent said, referring to ICE.""

Pergram: Crazy days - Fox News: ""House Republicans are driving Democrats crazy, and driving a major wedge through the majority party. GOPers are using a garden-variety procedural tool to goad Democrats into taking challenging votes on the floor - and risking the defeat or alteration of legislation which is on the verge of passing. The parliamentary gambit is called the 'Motion to Recommit,' or MTR as it's known in congressional shorthand. MTR's must be 'germane' and tied directly to the legislation at hand. In short, an MTR can't deal with cats if the bill deals with dogs. At the end of almost every debate, just before the House votes on most major legislation, the majority provides the minority a parliamentary option, which, depending on how it's drafted, could either change or possibly kill bills. In its purest form, a MTR is just that: an effort to 'recommit' legislation to committee, whisking it off the floor.""

"I was about to go to Confession in Jerusalem when I learned that my friend Andrew Breitbart had suddenly died, seven years ago today. I was on pilgrimage and the next morning we celebrated Mass for the repose of his soul in the chapel at the Church of the Holy Sepluchre where Jesus is believed to have been crucified.

Andrew would talk. And sometimes we'd talk about eternal things. He believed in truth and had hope and lived gratitude. And he was an insatiable seeker. I always wondered if at the right time, he might do something crazy like become Catholic. He could help rebuild the Church! He and his beloved Susie were always just about the warmest people -- she still is. And I can't help but think he might be rooting on many things good and true and beautiful today from another place. I know he's still a force in the lives of his family, because I see him in their eyes and lives, whenever Susie shares stories and photos.

I loved Andrew, I feel like we grew up together figuring out the early internets world and how commentary and news could look different and move things. (Sometimes I think I need to do some penance for some of it. We were Twitter hot takes before that was a thing. Here's where trust in a Divine plan and mercy and redemption come in handy.) And I will never get over hearing his last name bandied about in news and politics. Whatever it is, I always want to stop the maddening debate and say: His name was Andrew and he was a man with a family and friends who lived and loved and was more than whatever you're frenzying about now. One of my favorite memories of him was in the Cayman Islands -- he and his family came on a National Review cruise -- they went off to scuba dive or something else fun like that. I believe that was during his final year.

I miss the long talks -- which would usually include all sorts of people stopping by and lots of fascinating sidebars -- and instant messages and the night he called me to tell me they had named their newborn after William F. Buckley Jr. (I just laughed out loud -- which I did not expect, but that came with Andrew territory! -- rereading this, which I wrote in the hours after his death, remembering the time he taught me how to crash a Vanity Fair (I think it was) party (this was back in the days when he was still a behind-the-scenes mover and shaker with Matt Drudge, a skill, I confess I never put to use after -- and could never pull off without him).

Good man, good times, good life. God bless his family. Maybe remember them in a prayer when you're hearing about the website that was once a wedding present to him and Susie. Maybe remember that all those people in the news are, in fact, people with stories and families and crosses and joys that are often unseen. Maybe pray for their peace and their wisdom. These things in the increase these days would help matters, not hurt. I pray for his eternal rest. God be good to him! -- as a wise friend of mine often says on the passing of someone beloved.",643,nationalreview.com,Remembering Andrew Breitbart | National Review
"WASHINGTON -- We tend to believe informants like Michael Cohen, studies show and psychologists say.

It doesn't matter if the person is behind bars or has confessed to lying, as Cohen has: Juries usually believe an informant, said Jeffrey Neuschatz, a University of Alabama psychologist who has studied jailhouse informants' testimony for a decade.

Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, pleaded guilty last year to lying to Congress. On Wednesday, he gave harsh testimony about Trump to a US House committee, where he found a receptive audience from Democrats and drew the ire of Republicans who labeled him a felon and a liar. Trump, who had earlier called Cohen a ""Rat"" on Twitter, slammed the testimony as ""fake.""

Neuschatz said Cohen fits in with the informants he has studied. And ""people almost reflexively believe confessions. In the case of Cohen, he's given a sort of confession here,"" Neuschatz said.

""I think he came across as very credible, whether he is or not,"" he added.

The theory is that people tend to believe others -- called ""a truth bias"" -- unless they are given a reason not to, he said.

""People tend to take what other people say at face value,"" said Saul Kassin, a psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

Jurors sometimes even disregard their own biases, Neuschatz said.

He did studies with mock jurors who said they wouldn't trust informants who repeatedly testify against defendants. The jurors were told the informants had testified as many as 20 times and the panelists usually believed their testimony. Another of his mock jury tests showed convictions jumped from 30 percent to 62 percent with the addition of a jailhouse informant.

Informants ""acknowledge that they have done misdeeds and say 'now you should believe me.' That seems to me what Cohen did,"" Neuschatz said. And then people think ""no one would be admitting to doing something they didn't do, so they must be telling the truth,"" Neuschatz said.

In court, when jurors think an informant has little to gain or even is hurt by coming forward, they are more likely to believe the person, the experts said.

That's why University of Massachusetts psychology professor Robert Feldman, who has studied everyday lying for 30 years, said he believes Cohen: ""He doesn't have much to gain by lying,"" he said. He said when he evaluates people, his key question is: ""What would the lie get you?""

Cohen has already been sentenced to three years in prison, though he could have it reduced later at the request of prosecutors because of cooperation.

There is one added confusing factor in the Cohen case: politics. With politics, Kassin said, ""people see what they expect to see,"" so Democrats will tend to believe Cohen and Republicans won't.",644,New York Post,Research shows people tend to believe informants like Cohen
"Gov. Cuomo said Friday that ""I have no reason to believe"" that Amazon will change it's mind about coming to Queens, explaining that a full-page ad taken out by supporters of the company was also intended to let other businesses know New York is still ""open for business.""

Despite his gloomy assessment, the governor said he's still hopeful Amazon will do an about-face and guaranteed ""I will get the state approval done"" if it does.

""They've given no indication that they would reconsider. I think the point is not that Amazon is going to change its mind. I don't think they do,"" Cuomo said on WNYC radio.

Asked about opponents in the state Senate who helped scare away the retail giant, Cuomo dismissed them as meaningless.

""At this point they are irrelevant,"" he said. ""There are other ways for the state to get this done."" Cuomo's comments come on the same day the New York Times published a full-page ad with an open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos signed by 78 business, labor and civic leaders that says, ""A clear majority of New Yorkers support this project and were disappointed by your decision not to proceed.""

Cuomo admitted Amazon's decision on Feb. 14 to withdraw from Long Island City was a ""tremendous loss"" and ""national story"" -- in other words, national embarrassment for the governor and New York.

He blamed the Amazon defeat on ""local, petty politics"" and ""distortions""spurred by a ""small, vocal minority.""

"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rejects calls to resign amid growing scandal

The former right-hand man of Justin Trudeau is returning to Ottawa's Parliament Hill in an attempt to help stop a growing corruption scandal from destroying the Canadian prime minister's career.

Earlier this week, Jody Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau's former Attorney General, delivered explosive testimony that alleged the Canadian leader and his senior aides pressured her to intervene and defer criminal charges in a case against Montr√©al-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

If the current bribery charges that the firm is facing -- which date back to contracts the company was awarded in Qaddafi-era Libya -- lead to a conviction, it would be banned from bidding on federal contracts for a decade. That would likely result in the firm either dissolving or moving out of the country.

JUSTIN TRUDEAU DODGES CALLS TO RESIGN AMID FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ALLEGATIONS IN BRIBERY SCANDAL

Wilson-Raybould's testimony was a political earthquake for the Liberal Party, which entered 2019 expecting to sail to a relatively easy second term at an election scheduled for this October. Overnight, the party's chances at re-election have dimmed considerably, and Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer this week took the extraordinary step of calling for Trudeau's resignation.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done,"" the Tory leader said following Wilson-Raybould's testimony.

Trudeau and his allies in the government have denied that Wilson-Raybould's testimony is accurate, but they will soon have a testimony of their own to directly refute her. Following her appearance before the House of Commons Justice Committee, the Prime Minister's former principal secretary Gerald Butts asked the committee's chair -- via Twitter -- if he, too, could testify about the SNC-Lavalin affair. Such a request is unusual but reflects the unprecedented nature of the current scandal engulfing Canadian politics.

It seems unlikely Butts will admit to any wrongdoing when he testifies before the committee. In his 18 February resignation letter, he wrote, ""at all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians...From my perspective, our relationship [between Butts and Wilson-Raybould] has always been defined by mutual respect, candor and an honest desire to work together.""

For nearly four years, Butts was the most powerful person in the Prime Minister's office, and is considered the architect of the campaign that catapulted the Liberal Party from third-place to the government benches at the 2015 federal election. But Butts abruptly resigned from his position in February, days after the SNC-Lavalin scandal was first broken by The Globe & Mail.

It isn't known yet exactly what Butts will say in his testimony, expected this coming Wednesday, but it is nearly certain he will come to the defense of the office he left several weeks ago, and in particular Trudeau himself, chief of staff Katie Telford, and legal advisor Mathieu Bouchard, all of whom were accused directly by Wilson-Raybould of attempting to politically interfere in the SNC court case.

TRUDEAU'S TOP ADVISER RESIGNS BUT DENIES WRONGDOING

""In my view, these events constituted pressure [from Trudeau, Butts, Telford and Bouchard] to intervene in a matter and that this pressure or political interference to intervene was not appropriate. However, Canadians can judge this for themselves, as we now have the same frame of information,"" she said in her testimony.

Even if Trudeau manages to weather the scandal and cling to power at this fall's election, many in his party are now unsure he should stay on as leader. Wilson-Raybould herself is reportedly among those in the party with prime ministerial aspirations.

That could be among the reasons why Trudeau suggested at a press conference in St. Hubert, Que., earlier this week that he was considering kicking Wilson-Raybould out of the Liberal caucus.

""I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,"" he said.

She had previously reaffirmed her desire to remain a Liberal MP, and committed to running for re-election under the party's banner in her wealthy inner-Vancouver seat. However, Trudeau could unilaterally decide to remove her from the party's parliamentary caucus anyway. If next week's testimony doesn't succeed in changing the channel on the scandal, it seems likely he may choose to do just that.",646,Fox News,Justin Trudeau's former right-hand man to ride to the rescue and testify over damaging corruption scandal
"If you read nothing else today, make it Carl Trueman's short essay on Philip Rieff and cultures of the Third World. Rieff is not talking about underdeveloped countries. He's talking about people like us, who live in a world without absolutes. It's a (very) short course in the basics of Rieff's cultural analysis. Excerpts:

In Sacred Order/Social Order, Rieff offers a historical scheme for categorizing cultures in light of these basic insights. Rieff calls these First, Second, and Third World cultures. First Worlds are characterized by a variety of myths that ground and justify their cultures through something that transcends the immediate present. These might be the tales of the gods and heroes in the Iliad or the Norse sagas, the philosophy of Plato, or the mythic stories of origin found in Native American societies. Whatever their specific content, what they share in common is that they make the present culture accountable to something greater than itself. Rieff says that a belief in fate is perhaps the key here.

Second Worlds are characterized not by a belief in fate but by faith. The great examples would be Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, where cultural codes are rooted in the belief in a specific divine and sovereign being who stands over and above creation, and to whom all creatures are ultimately accountable. First and Second Worlds are similar in that both set their social order upon a deeper, even sacred, order. It is the Third World that represents a decisive rupture on this point.

Third Worlds are characterized by their repudiation of any sacred order. There is nothing in a Third World beyond this world by which culture can be justified. The implications of this are, according to Rieff, comprehensive and catastrophic. First, because of their rejection of a sacred order, Third World cultures face an unprecedented challenge: that of justifying themselves on the basis of themselves. No culture in history, Rieff notes, has ever done this successfully. It is a fool's errand that ends in cultural collapse:

No culture in history has sustained itself merely as a culture, however attractive and authoritative. Cultures are dependent on their predicative sacred orders and break into mere residues whenever their predicates are broken. That is the main reason why our late second cultures and early thirds are increasingly unstable.

Cultural conservatives (in the true and literal sense of the term) are not engaging opponents with whom they simply disagree about the content of culture. They disagree with them on what exactly culture is: either it is something grounded in a sacred order or it is something free-floating and up for grabs. Those are incommensurable positions. If Rieff is right, the prospect for improvement is minimal. As Nietzsche's Madman pointed out many years ago, if you unchain the earth from the sun, you end up plunging into total darkness.

Read the whole thing.

Again, this may tell you why I believe that Donald Trump is far from the worst of our problems. Politically, the best I hope for is a government that protects the ability of people like me and my own to live without oppression by the people who believe these things that are incommensurable with what I believe. At this point, politics in America is the art of managing decline, and trying to keep things from going too far off the rails before something happens that will regenerate sacred order. What that ""something"" is, aside from mass religious conversion, I have no idea.

When you read Houellebecq's Submission, you understand the appeal of political Islam to a people who are rootless and sick unto death. Those people are a kind of solution. As for us Christians, most of us don't even understand what's happening to the West. We are like the doomed rabbit in Larkin's poem Myxomatosis:

You may have thought things would come right again

If you could only keep quite still and wait.

Recently I met a man who had converted to Christianity out of OTO, the cult associated with Aleister Crowley. This Christian convert had spent years in it. The man said that at the heart of it was Crowley's belief that ritualized sexual perversion would be the key to destroying all taboos on the exercise of pure will. The man said that he was finally driven away by the sexual things he was going to be required to do to ascend in the cult. (I'm not going to link to any of the publicly available information on what these things are, but to call it extreme is to vastly understate the reality.)

The man told me that to live in our own culture today is to see how triumphant Crowley's ideas have become in the mainstream, without most people understanding any of it. I believe him. One more quote from Carl Trueman's essay on Rieff:

Given that Rieff believes cultures to be defined by what they prohibit, particularly in the sexual realm, the Sadean vision of the Third World as one of the abolition of sexual codes, of ""forbidding to forbid,"" has far-reaching significance. Indeed, it leads Rieff to call this type of culture an anti-culture. Its purpose is not to transmit beliefs and practices from one generation to the next. Its purpose is quite the opposite: to shatter past values and to engage in the constant revolutionizing of beliefs and behavior. While all First and Second World cultures acknowledged the reality of transgression, in the Third World transgression becomes the norm. In fact, given that it is forbidden to forbid, the very concept of transgression ceases to have any stable meaning.

As I have said here before, I think Donald Trump is in no sense a solution to our crisis, but is in fact a manifestation of it. What is hard for many people -- on the political and cultural Left, certainly, but also on the establishment Right -- to understand is that we live in a Philip Rieff world, in which all the Respectable People running the institutions and comprising the societal elites are busily and respectably tearing down the foundations of culture. It didn't start with them, and it didn't start in the 1960s -- though the acceleration began to pick up then.

For me, the most important political question is: how to protect people and institutions of the Second World from the barbarism of the Third World, even as the Third World careens towards cataclysm? (Understand that I'm using ""Second World"" and ""Third World"" in the Rieff sense, not in the geopolitical sense.) In other words, under what kind of political leaders is the Benedict Option -- which will, in time, be the regenerator of our culture -- most likely to thrive? When you regard politics through the eyes of a Rieffan (Rieffish?) cultural diagnosis, it is hard to see the line between Good and Evil running between Donald Trump and those opposed to him. This is why I see conservative federal judges as the last serious line of defense for social and religious conservatives over the next two, maybe three decades. What a bitter irony for conservatives of my generation and older!

Somebody said on Twitter the other day, I forget who it was, that Trump makes explicit an ugly truth: that this society no longer has norms, and its institutions have rotted from within. That's putting it more strongly than I would, but not by much. Donald Trump is a barbarian whose barbarism is somewhat more obvious than the barbarism of those who most hate him. We live in bad times. How good men and women live together in such times, indeed thrive in them, is the chief political problem we face.",647,The American Conservative,We Live In Rieff World

"Sens. Mike Braun (R-IN) and Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced a bill on Friday that would prevent former lawmakers from using their influence on Capitol Hill from lobbying.

Braun and Scott introduced the Banning Lobbying and Safeguarding Trust (BLAST) Act, that would block former lawmakers from lobbying their friends on Capitol Hill. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-IN) introduced the companion legislation in the House.

""One of the reasons I left the private sector for Washington was to help President Trump drain the swamp, and we can accomplish this by permanently banning Congressmen and Senators from lobbying Capitol Hill,"" said Braun in a statement on Friday. ""Together we can end the revolving door of career politicians coming to Washington, spending time in Congress, then enriching themselves from their service to the American people.""

Sen. Scott said:

I'm proud to introduce this bill that imposes a permanent ban on members of Congress becoming lobbyists. Rather than serving the public, too many in Washington spend their political careers preparing for a lucrative job at a DC lobbying firm where they can cash in on their connections and their access. Congress should never serve as a training ground for future lobbyists, and putting an end to the revolving door is a common sense way to make Washington work for families.

The legislation serves as the latest legislation the two freshman Republican senators have proposed to both improve governance on Capitol Hill and drain the Washington, D.C. swamp.

Braun and Scott introduced legislation in February that would end taxpayer-funded congressional pensions; the two contending that the bill would drain the Washington swamp.

Sens. Scott and Braun noted in a press release that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has been in Congress for 33 years, and if she retired tomorrow, her annual taxpayer-funded pension would be over $102,000.

Braun said in February, ""If we remove the luxurious perks from Congress, we'll get better leaders: that's why I'll never accept my Senate pension and, if forced to, I pledge to donate every penny to Hoosier charities.""

The Hoosier senator, who came to Washington as a populist politician, introduced a bill in January that would block any lawmaker from receiving a paycheck if Congress does not pass a budget.

Hoosier told Breitbart News about the No Budget, No Pay bill:

When I decided to run, I also decided to sign the term limits bill. I signed a pledge as a senator, and I'll be forthright here: we don't send the cream of the crop to D.C., and I said that many times and that's because most people that have really done something in the real world are not going to give up that to build a career in politics.

"TPUSA announced Allie Stuckey as Chairwoman of its Young Women's Leadership Summit, at CPAC on Thursday.

Stuckey is currently the host of the CRTV podcast, ""Relatable,"" focused on breaking down the latest happenings in culture, news, and politics from a Christian, conservative perspective.

In 2015, Stuckey began speaking to college sororities about the importance of voting, which later turned into her blog, entitled, ""The Conservative Millennial,"" launching her into the conservative political movement.

Stuckey appeared in her first viral video last summer -- a satirical piece on then-congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in which Stuckey combined video footage of her own separately recorded questions with the candidate's apparent blunders from a PBS interview.

The obviously satirical video displayed the rearranged video footage cutting back and forth between Stuckey and Ocasio-Cortez, which made waves on social media.

"NATIONAL HARBOR, MARYLAND -- Donald Trump Jr. fired up conservative activists Thursday night attending a party hosted by Turning Point USA, a group organizing young conservatives on college campuses.

""We need you to be part of the fight!"" he said at the event, standing up with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and Director of Communications Candace Owens. The event kicked off a series of parties surrounding the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside Washington, DC.

Kirk led students attending the event with chants of ""USA! USA! USA!""

""Imagine doing that at a Democratic party?"" Trump Jr. replied. ""They'd kill you!""

Kimberly Guilfoyle attended the event with Donald Trump Jr. leading chants of ""Trump! Trump! Trump!""

""How much do we love our president and the first family?"" she said as the crowd cheered. ""Let's show the president some of the love that the mainstream media won't report!""

Donald Trump Jr. praised the young people for working to fight socialism in America:

He said:

If the last couple of weeks of what's going on in US politics hasn't shown you everything you need to know that you're on the right side, with the post-term abortion nonsense or any of the crazy that's being thrown out there, 93 trillion dollars and we're going to pay people who don't to work, you're on the right side of this guys, history is going to remember you favorably.

The party was the physical meme-child of Turning Point USA's newest hire of conservative journalist Benny Johnson as their content creator.

The organization reserved the entire Cadillac Ranch bar outside of the convention center featuring cardboard cutouts of American celebrities and political figures such as Ronald Reagan, Kanye West, Hillary Clinton, Tim Tebow, Tom Brady, Clint Eastwood, and Taylor Swift.

TVs at the bar played looped footage of the president and the first lady and a host of internet memes including cartoon astronauts

emphatically planting the American flag into the moon.

""This didn't exist a few years ago,"" Trump Jr. said, referring to the culture of the rising organization of young people. ""Thank you for making me party and making people see what this party is all about.""

White House Communications director Bill Shine and his wife Darla were spotted as well as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and newly elected former Navy SEAL Congressman Dan Crenshaw.

Attendees Instagrammed pictures of the drink menu which included drinks like a ""juice box"" for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a ""Mexico will pay for it"" Tequila sunrise and a ""Sarah Sanders"" which was bourbon on the rocks.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faces backlash after Amzaon's decision to pull out of building a new NYC headquarters

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have served a combined 48 years in the Senate. They've served an additional 27 years in various mayoral offices and governor's mansions across the country. Their total time in the House of Representatives adds another three decades of service. When you factor in likely candidates who have not yet declared or formed exploratory committees, those numbers rise to 108, 73, and 76 years, respectively. Yet who leads this historically broad and experienced presidential field? A 29-year-old bartender just wrapping up her first month in office.

To be sure, New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is too young to launch her own bid for the White House. Nevertheless, the freshman congresswoman controls an entire primary pack of candidates too craven and opportunistic to offer any ideas themselves.

What major piece of legislation has Cory Booker, D-N.J., ever sponsored? What precisely constitutes the political legacy of Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.? The presidential aspirants have played it safe their entire careers. This cautious strategy has served them well - so well that now they hope to follow a first-term radical all the way to the Oval Office.

DON'T BE FOOLED BY BERNIE'S MONEYBOMB: SANDERS 2020 IS GOING NOWHERE

Last November, Ocasio-Cortez cooked her dinner live on Instagram. Within weeks Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, followed suit and opened their kitchens to the masses. A couple of months ago, a video emerged of Ocasio-Cortez dancing on a rooftop in college. As soon as the mainstream media covered the clip, Harris tweeted her own video shimmying back and forth in a chair. ""I'm for *more* dancing in politics,"" she beamed. Harris may dance, but Ocasio-Cortez calls the tune.

The nearest to a leader among the presidential aspirants is the 77-year-old socialist Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to whom progress means nothing more than rehashing the failed economic policies of the 1930s. Insomuch as he successfully pushed the Democratic Party toward the radical left in 2016, Sanders has accomplished more than his competitors. Still, three years later, even Bernie follows AOC's lead on selling socialism to the people.

Ocasio-Cortez's thrall over the 2020 race extends beyond style to specific matters of public policy. As she tells it, just a dozen years remain before air pollution extinguishes life on earth. To forestall Armageddon, we must pass the freshman congresswoman's radical ""Green New Deal."" This eco-socialist overhaul would outlaw planes, trains, automobiles, private health insurance, and 88 percent of the American energy industry before demolishing and rebuilding every edifice in the country, sticking the U.S. taxpayer with a $40 trillion tab. Nevertheless, as if in lockstep, Senators Gillibrand, Harris, Sanders, Warren, and Booker all signed up to co-sponsor the plan.

Advocates of Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal insist the plan enjoys wide support among all Americans, from liberal Democrats (92 percent) to conservative Republicans (57 percent). They fail to mention that virtually no one knows anything about it. According to the same Yale Center for Climate Change Communication study they cite, a full 82 percent of respondents knew ""nothing at all"" about the Green New Deal before answering the survey questions, all of which described the proposal in positive terms.

Presidential campaigns shed intense light on candidates and the policies they propose. One suspects support for the Green New Deal might crack once the American public learns the program will cost them their jobs, cars, doctors, flights, homes, heat, and electricity, among other pleasures.

Then the 2020 candidates will face an unpleasant choice: reverse course, thereby revealing themselves as the empty-suited opportunists that they are, or else persist in following an ignorant 20-something bartender down the path to electoral ruin.

"First-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (MI) take pride in being the first Muslim women elected to Congress -- as they should.

Whether they are doing a good job is another matter.

They have a lot to say about Israel -- some of it antisemitic -- as well as Venezuela. They also complain, frequently, about anti-Muslim prejudice in the U.S.

Curiously, neither one of them -- including Omar, who has a seat on the the House Foreign Affairs Committee -- has had anything to say in Congress about China's persecution of Muslims.

Last year, the Trump administration warned that China was imprisoning Muslims in concentration camps. The State Department issued a multilateral statement at the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in Washington, DC:

As representatives of the international community, we are deeply concerned about the significant restrictions on religious freedom in China and call on the Chinese government to respect the human rights of all individuals. Many members of religious minority groups in China - including Uighurs, Hui, and Kazakh Muslims; Tibetan Buddhists; Catholics; Protestants; and Falun Gong - face severe repression and discrimination because of their beliefs.

...

We are particularly troubled by reports of the Chinese government's deepening crackdown on Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in China, including: undue restrictions on freedom of religion; destruction of mosques; unprecedented levels of surveillance; efforts to pressure other governments into forcibly returning Uighurs to China or to coerce family members of Uighurs still in Xinjiang to encourage Uighurs living aboard to return; and the detention of hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in facilities ranging from makeshift holding centers to prisons, ostensibly for ""political re-education,"" in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. There are reports of deaths in these facilities. We call on the Chinese government to release immediately all those arbitrarily detained.

Some Muslim community organizations have been vocal in their criticism of China. But Omar and Tlaib have not.

These two so-called ""Justice Democrats"" are not the only Muslim public figures who are quiet about China. Most of the Muslim world's leaders, with the belated exception of Turkey's president, have been silent about China. And, as the Hoover Institution explained last year, that is because of China's growing economic and geopolitical power.

But there is no evidence that Omar and Tlaib owe anything to the Chinese government. That makes their reticence all the more puzzling.

Given that the Trump administration has adopted a confrontational tone toward China on trade, among other issues, one might think Omar and Tlaib would work with him -- or use the opportunity to insist that the president make Muslim human rights a key issue in future dealings with China. Trump would have little choice but to agree.

Yet they are silent.

At the risk of mind-reading, there seem to be three explanations.

One possibility is prejudice -- that is, they only care when Jews are the perceived aggressors.

Another is that Omar and Tlaib are ideologically bound to an anti-American axis in foreign policy that includes China and Iran. (Hence their defenses of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, for example.)

The final possibility is they simply cannot tolerate the thought of working with Trump, even to save Muslims in China. Both called for his impeachment this week, after all.

"Democrats are disappointed thanks to the testimony of President Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen.

Michael Cohen spent a decade as Trump's high-profile lobbyer, toady, defender and personal attorney. And then one day, he decided that he hated Donald Trump and became Donald Trump's mortal enemy. A big change. How did that happen?

Well, Cohen told Congress this week that he had a kind of a road to Damascus experience. He was personally and morally offended by what his boss said on two occasions. First, after the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, that was the summer of 2017 and later, when he watched Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland about a year later. Those two scandals, both of them fraudulent, entirely manufactured by the left and its servants in the media, changed Michael Cohen's mind forever.

Democrats must have been gratified to hear that. Michael Cohen is a sensitive, progressive now. He is tormented by climate change and his own toxic masculinity. He is basically a one-man crusade against privilege. He is a new man. That's his story.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.

Well, now comes a Daily Mail piece that puts a different gloss on it. It turns out, just weeks before the FBI raided his offices last summer, Michael Cohen was shopping a book proposal. In the manuscript, which the Daily Mail has, Cohen professes love and admiration for Donald Trump. In the book proposal, Cohen defends the president against claims that he is ""crazy, dumb, paranoid, in over his head or a liar"" -- all claims that Cohen made this week before Congress. Keep in mind that Cohen wrote the book proposal well after Charlottesville and Helsinki, those scandals that just changed him as a man.

It turns out that Michael Cohen is not a very reliable narrator. But too late, he is the narrator the Democrats have chosen, and they are stuck with him. They brought him to Capitol Hill on Wednesday in the hope, the expectation, that he would prove the Russia conspiracy true.

He didn't. Instead, he demolished that conspiracy. Nobody on the left wants to admit that, but we have the tape. Let's start with the claim that Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague in an effort to steal the 2016 election. On its face, it sounds nuts, but they have been telling you that for years. Even John Brennan has said it. Whatever his faults, he was literally the head of the CIA, the most powerful intelligence agency in the world, and he claimed to believe that. Oswald went to Mexico City, Cohen went to Prague ... it's the perfect conspiracy.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Except that Michael Cohen has never been to Prague. He testified to that on Wednesday. And by the way, he had no incentive to lie about it.

""Have you ever been to Prague?"" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. asked.

""Never been to Prague"" ... but I kind of like the music. How frustrating it must have been for Rep. Adam Schiff to hear that. ""Never been to Prague."" This was the part where Michael Cohen was supposed to admit swapping micro-film with Vladimir Putin in the sauna at the Prague Marriott. Instead, he looked kind of mystified and admitted he had never even been to the country. Michael Cohen is from Long Island. He pretty much stays there.

Instead of confirming the Russia conspiracy that dominated and controlled American politics for more than two years, Michael Cohen just refuted it. What kind of witness is this guy anyway? This is getting very frustrating. Where do we get to the part where he blows the Russia case wide open and they lead Big Orange away in handcuffs and Hillary can be the president?

Okay, let's try this again. How about the claim that Vladimir Putin's agents have video of Donald Trump cavorting with hookers, and that's how they've managed to blackmail Trump into saying nice things about Russia. We've been hearing about that since the day BuzzFeed first claimed it. If there is a hooker tape out there, I think it's fair to assume that Michael Cohen would know about it. He is that kind of guy, a hooker tape kind of guy. Now would probably be the time he would tell us all about it, but no.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.

""Are you aware of anything that the president has done at home or abroad that may have subjected him to or may subject him to extortion or blackmail?"" asked Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md, at Wednesday's hearing.

""I am not. No,"" Cohen said.

""Okay, are you aware of any videotapes that may be the subject of extortion or blackmail?""

I've heard about these tapes for a long time. I've had many people contact me over the years. I have no reason to believe that that tape exists.

Oh damn, he did it again, straying from the script. Instead of confirming the Russia conspiracy that dominated and controlled American politics for more than two years, Michael Cohen just refuted it. What kind of witness is this guy anyway? This is getting very frustrating. Where do we get to the part where he blows the Russia case wide open and they lead Big Orange away in handcuffs and Hillary can be the president?

Well, here is an idea, let's just ask him directly. Did the Trump campaign collude with the Russian government during the 2016 election? Michael Cohen would know. He was there. By the way, it's almost a rhetorical question. Democrats have long been absolutely certain that it happened.

""I think there is plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has said.

""We saw cold, hard evidence of the Trump campaign, and indeed the Trump family, eagerly intending to collude, possibly, with Russia,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said.

""Plenty of evidence."" ""Cold, hard evidence."" Well, if anyone can provide that kind of evidence, it would be Michael Cohen. After all, he was Donald Trump's -- is that really his name? No, it's Donnell Troponovich. He was Donnell Troponovich's personal attorney during the years that Troponovich was accepting suitcases full of rubles in exchange for subverting American democracy.

So what is the answer, Mr. Cohen?

""Based on what you know, would Mr. Trump or did he lie about colluding and coordinating with the Russians at any point during the campaign?"" asked Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.

""So, as I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word 'colluding,'"" Cohen replied. ""Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin? Yes. But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion.""

The balloon just deflated. Talk about a let-down. No meeting in Prague. No blackmail. No collusion. No Russia conspiracy at all. It was all a hoax. It was a much less interesting Loch Ness monster. You've got to be feeling a little silly right now if you ever believed any of this.

But wait. We've got one last idea. There is still a way Michael Cohen could send Donald Trump to prison even without Russia. What if Cohen could confirm that Trump once told him to lie to Congress? That would be obstruction of justice, at the very least. It would certainly be a crime. BuzzFeed ran a story alleging that happened. Yes, BuzzFeed is a cat blog run by unhappy people in Brooklyn. But who knows? Maybe there is something there. Certainly, cable news was convinced they had the latest bombshell from the cat blog --our last hope to end this infernal presidency and return to the happy status quo of 2010.

Our hopes are on you, Michael Cohen. Did it actually happen? The reveal, please?

""You lied to those congressional committees, is that correct?"" Greg Steube, R-Fla., asked Cohen at Wednesday's hearing.

""You stated that Trump never directed you to lie to Congress. Is that correct?""

""That's correct.""

No. Four for four. Michael Cohen strikes out. Game, set, match. The Trump presidency continues. The other team looks despondent. You can hear weeping from the press box.

But wait, before we head to the parking lot and drive home, one final piece of business: What about all of the lies you just heard, not from Cohen, but from the others? Blackmail. Collusion. Russia, Russia, Russia! Are any of the liars who told those lies going to be punished for lying? Is anybody going to lose a job? Or a reputation? Or a contributor contract?

"Does anyone really believe that Weld, Hogan, or Kasich is going to define the future of the post-Trump Republican party?

The race for 2020 is taking shape, although there are still significant unknowns, including whether Donald Trump will get a serious primary challenge.

His fiercest Republican critics say, ""Yes -- please, please, yes.""

They are probably wrong, and it's certainly nothing to root for.

Trump's dominance of the party begins with his lockdown support of the right, forcing any primary challenger to the left. This isn't fertile territory. Self-identified moderates and liberals are only a fraction of the party, and it is grass-roots conservative activists who have fueled the most potent Republican primary challenges (Ronald Reagan in 1976, Pat Buchanan in 1992).

Because a primary challenge would naturally come from the left and is unlikely to succeed, it will tend to attract people who don't have a future in GOP national politics and lack conservative bona fides -- the wayward former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld; the centrist governor of Maryland Larry Hogan; the former Ohio governor John Kasich, who convincingly demonstrated his lack of national electoral appeal in 2016.

Trump is in a stronger position in the party now than he was then. He's been a rock on judges, abortion, and religious liberty. Last time, many Republicans told themselves, ""Well, at least compared to Hillary, we don't know what we're getting with Trump."" Now, they are grateful for what they've gotten.

Could all of this change? It would require a torpedo to the bow from some enormous scandal and a significant ideological betrayal on something extremely important, like a Supreme Court nominee.

The promoters of a Trump primary challenge still haven't come to grips with how intertwined Trump's fate is with the party's.

If Trump becomes seriously vulnerable to a primary challenge, it's a sign that something very bad has happened that won't be constrained to him. Say it's proof of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians. Is the rest of the party that has defended Trump so vociferously in the Mueller probe going to emerge unscathed? Say it's a sudden economic downturn. What's the case that such an event wouldn't tank the GOP generally?

Indeed, a winning primary campaign against Trump would almost certainly be a catastrophic success. How would the winner put the party back together again for the general election?

Perhaps the hardcore Trump base and media will enthusiastically back whoever slays their champion. But why would they? Besides the inevitable hurt feelings and ideological disagreements, they will surely consider recent precedent -- Never Trump would be the analogue to Never Hogan.

Of course, a primary campaign doesn't have to be about winning. Futile gestures can achieve a kind of grandeur. Bill Buckley was never going to win the 1965 New York City mayoral campaign, but he did promote his brand of conservatism. In their primary challenges, Reagan and Buchanan were movement-builders, not just candidates.

There are people out there who may well have significant say in the party's future -- a Nikki Haley or a Tom Cotton -- but for them, 2024 will come soon enough (if Trump loses, the presidential jockeying begins in less than two years; if he wins, in less than four).

There is obviously a character case to be made against Trump, although Republican voters are already aware of his flaws and strongly support him nonetheless.

The contradiction in the case for a primary challenge is this: If it's a bad thing that Trump is potentially a weak general-election candidate, as Trump's critics say, then why make him potentially weaker with a primary challenge? What many of Trump's GOP detractors won't say out loud is that when they talk of defeating Trump, they don't mean only defeating him in a nomination battle; they mean seeing him lose in a general election.

That Republican voters would sense this, and understandably recoil, is another reason a primary challenge is probably a box canyon.",655,nationalreview.com,Don't Root for a Trump Primary Challenge | National Review

In January, she appeared on CNN, where she was described as an undocumented ""Dreamer"" and spoke out about her immigration status being debated during the government shutdown.

"Officials from Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, New York, and California say they will sue the Trump administration over the new rule that marks a clear line between abortion and family planning.

The rule, slated to go into effect in April, governs Title X, the federal grant program that provides funding for family planning services. It reinstates President Ronald Reagan's ""Protect Life Rule,"" which bars the ""co-location"" of federally funded family planning clinics and abortion clinics.

The new regulation prohibits the use of the funds to ""perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.""

However, Planned Parenthood and other abortion vendors who wish to continue to receive Title X family planning funds may do so if they choose either to end their abortion services from all locations that receive the Title X funding, or move those abortion services offsite to an entirely different location.

While many of the claims against the Trump administration say its new rule will create a negative impact on low-income individuals, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini noted the new rule actually protects individuals at or near the poverty level.

""[The] new regulation protects low-income women who rely on Title X assistance because no funds will be cut from the program,"" she said, observing that women in need can receive family planning services at federally qualified health centers (FQHC), which outnumber abortion centers 20 to one.

""At FQHCs women benefit from better regulatory oversight, a wider range of services, and more life-affirming options,"" she said. ""The new Title X regulations are a win-win for all Americans.""

However, in Washington, Democrat Attorney General Bob Ferguson joined with leaders from Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association to announce his lawsuit against the Trump administration. Ferguson claimed that more than half of the 91,284 patients in his state who received family planning services in 2017 were low-income individuals, reported KING5 News.

""I don't file a lawsuit unless I'm confident we will prevail,"" Ferguson said, according to Kaiser Health News. ""We've filed 17 cases against this administration. We have not lost a case yet.""

Oregon Democrat Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum called the Trump administration rule ""a direct assault on our core Oregon values.""

""[I]t is wrong and illegal and leaves our state with no choice but to file a lawsuit in the coming weeks to prevent it from going into effect,"" she said in a press statement.

In Connecticut, Democrat Attorney General William Tong said he would take ""swift legal action"" to preserve Planned Parenthood's federal funding.

""This action seeks to push a politically-motivated, anti-choice agenda on millions of individuals who rely on the Title X program for access to birth control and safe reproductive health care,"" he said, according to CTMirror.

However, Amanda Skinner, president of Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said, despite the new rule that would block federal funds, her organization can use privately donated funds and pursue other funding streams to make up for the $2.4 million in Title X funds received last year.

""We have seen repeated efforts on the part of this administration to dismantle programs or put into place programs that harm people who are already the most marginalized in our society,"" Skinner said.

Pro-life and faith-based groups in Connecticut, which already do their own fundraising, are encouraged by the Trump administration's new rule.

""We're grateful for whatever funds are re-directed away from Planned Parenthood because we do not believe that taxpayer funds should go to organizations that offer services that many millions of Americans don't support, as in abortions,"" said Christina Bennett, communications director for the Family Institute of Connecticut.

In a press statement, New York Democrat Attorney General Letitia James called the Trump administration's rule ""dangerous and unnecessary.""

""New York will not stand by as this Administration puts New Yorkers' health at risk for politics, and we will take legal action,"" she said.

Catholic News Agency reported Planned Parenthood of Illinois also said it would adapt to the new Trump administration rule to allow its patients to continue receiving family planning services.

Following the announcement of the finalized rule, the Illinois affiliate of Planned Parenthood launched Access Birth Control, an initiative that would provide birth control pills, IUDs, condoms, and Depo-Provera shots for free throughout the remainder of President Donald Trump's first term.

Maine Family Planning, a women's health care provider in the Pine Tree state, also announced last week that it would seek a preliminary injunction to block the new Trump administration rule. According to the Bangor Daily News, the organization receives about $2 million in federal family planning funds each year. One of its partner groups is Planned Parenthood.

Democrat Maine Gov. Janet Mills is allying herself with Maine Family Planning to ""determine what we can do at the state level to protect the health care of Maine women.""

Pro-abortion rights Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins is supportive of the efforts.

""I oppose this misguided rule change that could significantly diminish access for women to crucial contraceptive services, which have been critical in reducing the number of abortions in our country over the past three decades,"" Collins said in a statement.

The senator's spokeswoman said Collins would be looking into ""potential legislative remedies"" to the Trump administration rule in the near future.

Ann O'Leary, chief of staff to Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said Thursday her state also intends to sue the Trump administration.

"The New Mexico cowboys who recently rode through downtown Washington, DC, to show their support for President Donald Trump and his plan for a border wall did not get to meet the commander-in-chief. However, Couy Griffin subsequently got a phone call from the White House and shared the conversation with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily.

Marlow spoke with Griffin live at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland.

""We just wanted to go out simply and solely as a sign of support for our president -- let the president know we had his back,"" said Griffin, who along with about a dozen other cowboys, rode from Cumberland, Maryland, along the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Canal to Arlington Cemetery, where they got a police escort around the nation's capital.

""The first thing I told the president is, I told him, I said, 'Sir, I know there are lots around you that are armchair quarterbacking you,'"" Griffin said. ""'I know that everybody's a critic of everything you do, and many are telling you that you should be doing things differently, but I would like to speak on behalf of myself and millions of others who think just like me -- keep doing exactly what you're doing because you're doing a great job.'""

"Testimony this week by former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen has undermined Democrats' longstanding claims that President Trump's team colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, Fox News' Tucker Carlson said Thursday.

In making his argument on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Carlson cited four key moments from Cohen's Wednesday appearance before the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

""Instead of confirming the Russian conspiracy that has dominated and controlled American politics for more than two years, Michael Cohen just refuted it,"" Carlson said.

GOP REPS REFER MICHAEL COHEN TO DOJ FOR ALLEGED PERJURY DURING HEARING

Carlson first pointed to the allegation that Cohen met with Russian agents in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2016 to help secure a Trump election win. That argument quickly fell apart, Carlson said, when Cohen told members of the House panel that he's ""never even been to the Czech Republic.""

Then Carlson noted there were rumors that Russian agents possessed a video of Trump with prostitutes, and were using the video as leverage against the president. The Fox News host then reported that during this week's hearing, Cohen was asked if he was aware of Trump taking part, at home or abroad, in any activities that might subject him to blackmail or extortion.

""I am not, no,"" Cohen answered.

""I've heard about these tapes for a long time,"" Cohen added, specifically addressing the video rumors. ""I've had many people contact me over the years. I have no reason to believe that tape exists.""

COHEN TESTIMONY WAS 'BOMBSHELL THAT DIDN'T EXPLODE': MARC THIESSEN

Later during testimony, Carlson noted, Cohen was asked point-blank if the president lied about colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

""I wouldn't use the word 'colluding',"" Cohen responded. "" ... Was there something odd about the back-and-forth praise with President Putin? Yes, but I'm not really sure I can answer that question in terms of collusion.""

Finally, Carlson pointed out that Cohen told the House panel that Trump never directed him to lie to Congress.

""Turns out that Michael Cohen is not a very reliable narrator,"" Carlson said.

Carlson also referenced a Daily Mail report that he said raised further questions about Cohen's credibility.

""Turns out just weeks before the FBI raided his offices last summer, Michael Cohen was shopping a book proposal,"" Carlson said, citing the report.

""In the manuscript, which the Daily Mail has, Cohen professes love and admiration for Donald Trump,"" Carlson continued. ""In the book proposal, Cohen defends the president against claims that he is 'crazy, dumb, paranoid, in over his head or a liar,' all claims that Cohen made this week before Congress.""

Carlson concluded: ""Michael Cohen spent a decade as Trump's high-profile lobbier, toady, defender and personal attorney -- and then one day he decided that he hated Donald Trump and he became Donald Trump's mortal enemy.""",659,Fox News,"Michael Cohen testimony undermined Russia collusion narrative at 4 points, Tucker Carlson says"
"TOLEDO, Ohio -- About a month ago on a snowy afternoon, driving over the spindly 90-year-old Anthony Wayne Bridge, I couldn't help but notice how this city seemed stuck in neutral. Behind me was the huge Toledo Refinery, a 280-acre gasoline processing plant, but set in a neighborhood where the houses appeared older and less functional than the industrial site.

On the west side of the Maumee River were neighborhoods with wide boulevards with little traffic just south of downtown, filled with vacant lots, inner-city convenience stores, and grandiose churches from a bygone era. One of those churches was St. Anthony's, a Catholic church that was once home to Polish immigrants, a gothic structure of brick topped by a 250-foot steeple and built in 1894, but closed since 2005.

Then the radio reminded me why I was in Toledo. I was reporting on the environmental movement in this city that was trying to save the Great Lake it sits upon. ""The Lake Erie Bill of Rights"" was a charter amendment that would be put on the ballot and could bestow upon this body of water the legal designation of ""personhood."" That's right, Toledo wanted to radically change the legality of the natural environment, basically making this 10,000 square-mile lake it sits upon its child, with the citizens of the Glass City the lake's legal guardian. In essence, the parents then could sue on behalf of its child if the lake was bullied with polluters.

Obviously, there was pushback on this crazy idea from the agricultural and business community. ""What did these groups put in their bill of rights?"" the radio ad asked me. ""The right to hurt local farmers, the right to hurt small businesses, the right to drive up our food costs.""

Despite the notion that their grocery bill could go up if they voted for Lake Erie becoming a person, the city ordinance passed this week easily, by a 61 percent majority vote. And as predicted by many, the first court case has already been filed stating this measure is unconstitutional, unenforceable, and hurtful to farmers. But in talking to the organizers of this movement in Toledo, you realize quickly that the bill's passing was more about changing the local political process than succumbing to some liberal environmental ideology that some opponents portrayed them as.

""What we were being told is that we as the citizens of this city had no real say in what was happening in our community,"" says Markie Miller, a theater production manager in Toledo and one of the organizers of the ballot initiative. ""That way of thinking is inadequate. The federal and state government were defining the environmental rules we lived under, but nothing was changing.""

""So we figured those rules would be better handled by the city government instead of the powers that be elsewhere. It is a trend that I see growing and getting momentum all over the country.""

Some are calling this trend a return to the notion of the ""city-state,"" like Thebes in ancient Greece or Switzerland's Geneva in the Middle Ages or Hong Kong and Singapore now. It is a rebranding of ""home rule,"" knocking down the notion that nothing can happen in the United States unless the federal government and the state legislatures say it can.

To put it more clearly, cities are fighting against the inept largesse of the feds and the states-rights power grab by rural and exurb constituencies in recent decades. It is a movement of urban areas not fully independent of their nation-states, but not beggars or also-rans in the political process with them either.

In their book, Metropolitan Revolution: How Cities and Metros and Fixing Our Broken Politics and Fragile Economy, Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley of the Brookings Institute write about this restructured form of federalism taking place.

In traditional political science textbooks, the United States is portrayed neatly as a hierarchical structure - the federal government and the states on top, the cities and metropolitan areas at the bottom. The feds and the states are the adults in the system, setting direction; the cities and metropolitan areas are the children, waiting for their allowance. The metropolitan revolution is exploding this tired construct. Cities and metropolitan areas are becoming the leaders in the nation: experimenting, taking risk, making hard choices, and asking for forgiveness, not permission.

The movement to make Lake Erie a person (in Toledo) fits with this new thinking. In August of 2014, an algae bloom of unprecedented seriousness caused Toledo the city to ban drinking water for 500,000 residents for about a week -- and even elderly, children, and pregnant women were not permitted to shower. These blooms in the west basin of Lake Erie are caused by blue-green bacteria or cyanobacteria, single-celled organisms that naturally exist in fresh or salt waters, but grow to dangerous health levels when fed by nutrients from the watershed, often phosphorous and manure runoff from agricultural crop feeding.

After the water was restored, Toledo residents looked around and found that federal and state government had done little to alleviate the ongoing situation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had declared the Maumee River in Toledo an ""Area of Concern"" in 1987 from the agricultural runoff problem (and it still is). Ohio had tried repeatedly to designate the Maumee River's watershed and Lake Erie itself as ""distressed"" numerous times. But business and agricultural interests always fought those designations, along with any solutions that might alleviate the problem more efficiently, and the Toledo citizens found they had few options in dealing with the issue.

""I think what we did was a natural reaction to the idea that things had continued to be worse by following the plan our federal and state leaders had laid out for us,"" says Bryan Twitchell, a school teacher in Toledo. ""They stood up for interests outside our community in dealing with a problem that was happening within our community. That makes no sense to anyone. We had to change that.""

Are American urban areas becoming more independent city-states than second-fiddle step children under the national umbrella?

Some cities are deciding to get rid of interstate highways (or capping them as parks) when they run through central-city neighborhoods. Some are excising their own gasoline taxes so they can better control road fixing and building. Other cities are seeing that some federal programs actually make affordable housing plans harder to implement and are trying to deal with the issue on their own. Some urban areas are also looking at consolidating power by merging the inner-ring suburbs with the central city.

They are also dealing with mass transit funding, water conservation, and renewable energy more locally. Whether all of this means that America is fast becoming a collection of city-states or clusters of megacities remains to be seen. But today's political frameworks are changing, as both the right and left find some common interests.

In some ways, what is evolving is that liberal entitlement programs and libertarian free-market independence can not only coexist, but can promote each other in big cities. ""We understand that the Lake Erie as a legal entity will be challenged in court cases for some time, and we are prepared to fight those,"" Miller says. ""But what we found in this election is that we heard from other groups in this country and around the world that are experiencing the same problems. That big government is making it harder to take care of themselves, and not easier.""

""That's what we experienced and we decided to deal with it ourselves.""",660,The American Conservative,Toledo Takes Guardianship to Save Lake Erie
"""Politics stops at the water's edge"" was a tradition that, not so long ago, was observed by both parties, particularly when a president was abroad, speaking for the nation.

The tradition was enunciated by Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan in 1947, as many of the Republicans in the 80th Congress moved to back Truman's leadership in the Cold War against Stalin's empire.

The tradition lasted until the mid-1960s, when the left wing of the Democratic Party turned viscerally, and even violently, against the war in Vietnam and President Lyndon Johnson.

Republican Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush I, with the support of conservative Democrats, led America to final victory in the Cold War

Yet except for brief intervals, like the rallying around George H. W. Bush after the triumphant Gulf War of 1991 and George W. Bush after 9/11, true national unity has never been restored.

Were proof needed, this week provided it.

President Trump flew to Hanoi, Vietnam, to meet North Korea's dictator. Subject of negotiations: Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons, including his missiles that may be able to reach our homeland.

How did the Democratic Party wish the commander in chief well on his mission for America?

During Trump's first full day in Hanoi, a committee of Nancy Pelosi's House held a public hearing featuring ex-Trump lawyer and ""fixer"" Michael Cohen, a convicted perjurer and felon who cut a deal with the prosecution for a reduced sentence.

The city loved it. Cable and network TV coverage went gavel to gavel. Cohen's testimony crowded out the Trump-Kim summit and even news of aerial clashes between India and Pakistan, two nuclear powers that have fought three wars since independence, 70 years ago.

What were the headlines Trump came home to after refusing to lift sanctions on North Korea, in return for meager concessions Kim offered?

""Cohen Paints Trump as Crooked"" was the banner atop page one of The Washington Post. Cohen's depiction of his old boss was boldly quoted above: ""He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat.""

""Cohen Accuses Trump of Lies and Cover-ups"" ran the page-one headline in The New York Times.

""Cohen Declares Trump a Racist, Cheat and Conman"" read the huge headline in the Financial Times.

""Cohen Says Trump Guided Coverup"" was at the top of page one in The Wall Street Journal.

Trump is denounced for calling media the ""enemy of the people."" Yet that media, in news columns as well as editorials, routinely describes him as a racist, sexist, xenophobe, homophobe, Islamophobe and bigot.

Indulging its hatred of Trump is a preoccupation, an obsession of this capital city. Those headlines reveal not only the news judgment of the editors but the agenda of the elite who turn to them first every morning.

That agenda is the breaking of this president; his disgrace and fall; and, if impeachment proves not possible, his crushing defeat in 2020 and subsequent indictment. Our so-called Dreamers in Washington, D.C., look to the triumphal return to power of the establishment the American people threw out in 2016.

Yet the alliance that seeks to bring down Trump is formidable: deep-state leakers and media collaborators; the Democratic Party and House; most of America's commentariat; and the cultural elites in the arts, academia and Hollywood.

How far beyond normal politics have the divisions in our society gone? As the Covington Catholic kids found out, wearing a MAGA hat is now seen as a racist provocation.

In the play unfolding, Cohen's testimony to the House committee was scene one of act one.

Next comes the Mueller report, though it appears Robert Mueller and his team, after investigating for two years, have found no collusion between Trump and Vladimir Putin in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.

Hence, the hopes of Trump haters are being redirected to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Subjects of investigation: the Trump Organization, the Trump Inaugural Committee, the Trump Foundation, the Trump family and any entity with which Donald Trump has been associated in 40 years.

Again, as the president is chief of state and head of government, he cannot be indicted. He must first be removed from the presidency. But to remove him, Democrats have to impeach him in the House and convict him in a Republican Senate.

If they cannot, they will have to defeat him at the polls.

In 1968, George Wallace of Alabama tore the Southern populist right out of the Democratic Party. Liberals Gene McCarthy, Robert Kennedy and George McGovern then savaged Vice President Hubert Humphrey from the left. The Grant Park rioters did the rest.

Nixon, leading a minority Republican Party, had a compelling argument: ""If the Democrats cannot unite their own party, how can they unite the nation?""

Today, a watching world is asking: If you Americans are at war with yourselves over race, religion, morality, culture and politics, if you cannot unite yourselves, how can you unite the world? And around what?

Maybe the American Century is really over.

"The race for 2020 is taking shape, although there are still significant unknowns, including whether President Trump will get a serious primary challenge in his own party.

His fiercest Republican critics say, ""Yes -- please, please, yes.""

They are probably wrong, and it's certainly nothing to root for.

Trump's dominance of the party begins with his lockdown support of the right, forcing any primary challenger to the left. This isn't fertile territory. Self-identified moderates and liberals are only a fraction of the party, and it is grassroots conservative activists who have fueled the most potent Republican primary challenges (Ronald Reagan's in 1976, Pat ¬≠Buchanan's in 1992).

Because a primary challenge would naturally come from the left and is unlikely to succeed, it will tend to attract people who don't have a future in GOP ¬≠national politics and lack conservative bona fides.

Think of the likes of the wayward former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld; the centrist governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan; or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who convincingly demonstrated his lack of national electoral appeal in 2016.

Trump is in a stronger position in the party now than he was then. He has been a rock on judges, abortion and religious liberty. Last time, many Republicans told themselves, ""Well, at least compared to Hillary Cliton, we don't know what we're getting with Trump.""

Now, they are grateful for what they've gotten.

Could all of this change? It would require a torpedo to the bow from some enormous scandal and a significant ideological ¬≠betrayal on something extremely important, like a Supreme Court nominee.

The promoters of a Trump primary challenge still haven't come to grips with how intertwined Trump's fate is with the party's.

If Trump becomes seriously vulnerable to a primary challenge, it's a sign that something very bad has happened that won't be constrained to him.

Say it's proof of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians. Is the rest of the party that has defended Trump so vociferously in the Mueller probe going to emerge unscathed? Say it's a sudden economic downturn. What's the case that such an event wouldn't tank the GOP generally?

Indeed, a winning primary campaign against Trump would ¬≠almost certainly be a catastrophic success. How would the winner put the party back together again for the general election?

Perhaps the hardcore Trump base and media will enthusiastically back whoever slays their champion. But why would they? Besides the inevitable hurt feelings and ideological disagreements, they will surely consider recent precedent -- Never Trump would be the analogue to Never Hogan.

Of course, a primary campaign doesn't have to be about winning. Futile gestures can achieve a kind of grandeur. Bill Buckley was never going to win the 1965 New York City mayoral campaign, but he did promote his brand of conservatism. In their primary challenges, Reagan and Buchanan were movement-builders, not just candidates.

Does anyone really believe, though, that Weld, Hogan or Kasich are going to define the future of the post-Trump Republican Party? There are people out there who may well have significant say in the party's future -- a Nikki Haley or a Tom Cotton -- but for them 2024 will come soon enough (if Trump loses, the presidential jockeying begins in less than two years; if he wins, in less than four).

There is obviously a character case to be made against Trump, although Republican voters are already aware of his flaws and strongly support him nonetheless.

The contradiction in the case for a primary challenge is this: If it's a bad thing that Trump is ¬≠potentially a weak general election candidate, as Trump's critics say, then why make him potentially weaker with a primary challenge?

What many of Trump's GOP ¬≠detractors won't say out loud is that when they talk of defeating Trump, they don't mean only ¬≠defeating him in a nomination battle; they mean seeing him lose in a general election.

That Republican voters would sense this, and understandably recoil, is another reason a primary challenge is probably a box canyon.",662,New York Post,Why the drive to primary Trump in 2020 is utterly pointless

"Karvelis, who as a second year teacher led the Arizona teachers strike when he launched the #RedforEd movement in March 2018, has confirmed in his own words what Breitbart News reported last week:

A well-funded and subversive leftist movement of teachers in the United States threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority.

This teachers union effort, called #RedforEd, has its roots in the very same socialism that President Trump vowed in his 2019 State of the Union address to stop, and it began in its current form in early 2018 in a far-flung corner of the country before spreading nationally. Its stated goals-higher teacher pay and better education conditions-are overshadowed by a more malevolent political agenda: a leftist Democrat uprising designed to flip purple or red states to blue, using the might of a significant part of the education system as its lever.

""The first lesson I hope people take away from Arizona #RedForEd is that a grassroots, rank-and-file movement is absolutely necessary -- particularly in 'right-to-work' states,"" Karvelis wrote at the Jacobin Magazine website in January.

Karveli added four more lessons right out of the Saul Alinsky playbook, including (2) the need for ""a community-centric orientation to teachers' movements,"" (3) ""that democratic organizing, whether through union reforms or establishing new structures such as Arizona Educators United, must be embraced,"" (4) ""that the gradual escalation of tactics that was embraced in Arizona, and originally mobilized in West Virginia, is a vital strategy that can be duplicated in nearly any setting,"" and (5) ""the most important lesson to be learned is that teachers have tremendous power.""

Founded in 2010 by George Washington University student Bhaskar Sunakra, the Jacobin Magazine is an unabashed promoter of Marxism, proudly taking its name from the radical left Jacobins who turned the French Revolution of the 1790s into a bloodbath for their opponents.

The magazine does not specifically use the word ""Marxism"" in its about us page, instead calling itself, ""a leading voice of the American left, offering socialist perspectives on politics, economics, and culture.""

In a 2014 interview with New Left Review, Sunakra explained that he created Jacobin Magazine in order to ""mainstream"" the viewpoints of Young Marxists:

For me, it was a way of representing a politics that was neither Leninist nor the kind of broad liberal-left opinion you get in, say, The Nation or In These Times. It's not a middle ground: I wanted to stake out a vision that was uncompromisingly socialist, but that married some of the accessibility of The Nation with the political seriousness of publications further to the left. A lot of what I was learning during the year I spent reading was how to convey these ideas in as simple a way as possible.

Young Marxists have a tendency to use lots of jargon, partly as a crutch for insecurity; there are some things we do need specialized terminology for, but a lot of these ideas are not actually very complex. So I was thinking about how best to popularize and mainstream them. Jacobin was meant to be bold, young, easy to read. The look of the magazine was part of that too -- publications like Monthly Review or Dissent, for example, tend to have extremely long paragraphs, and there's no 'dek' underneath the headline explaining what's in the article. (Emphasis added.)

Sunakra elaborated on the Marxist orientation of his publication when asked by New Left Review about its ""intellectual reference points"":

Though I don't want to speak for everyone else, several of us came from traditions intellectually inspired by Trotskyism, without ever quite becoming Trotskyists -- which is similar to Miliband or someone like Leo Panitch in that respect. We were very interested in the experience of the Italian Communist Party and other mass parties in Europe, and in the theorists of Eurocommunism -- something that distinguishes us from a lot of Trotskyists. The Second International radicals were also very important for us -- from the time before the SPD voted for war credits in 1914, of course! So we read Lenin, but also Kautsky's The Road to Power. On the whole, we come from various traditions on the left, but you could say that there's been a convergence of sorts between those who come from post-Maoist and post-Trotskyist milieux, and those from left social-democratic traditions. (Emphasis added.)

It is organized as a 501 (c) (3) non-profit, which means it is not required to reveal its financial backers, and claims its website has over 1 million unique visitors a month, while its quarterly print magazine has 30,000 paid subscribers who pay between $25 and $250 annually.

According to its website, subscribers select the amount they should pay, based on how guilty they feel for the wealth they have accumulated.

In 2016, Vox described the Jacobin Magazine's growth and Sunakra's role as publisher and editor:

Jacobin has in the past five years become the leading intellectual voice of the American left, the most vibrant and relevant socialist publication in a very long time. And in 2016 it's bigger than ever, thanks to Bernie Sanders, who's making his millions of supporters curious about what democratic socialism actually means. That's an opportunity that Jacobin is seizing to great effect, even if Sanders isn't far enough left for their taste.

The Sanders campaign ""could begin to legitimate the word 'socialist,' and spark a conversation around it, even if Sanders's welfare-state socialism doesn't go far enough,"" Sunkara wrote earlier this year.

Vox pointed to the Jacobin Magazine's Marxist focus:

""It is unapologetic about its interests in political economy and Marxism; it's completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people's buttons,"" Brooklyn College professor Corey Robin, a longtime leftist writer who signed on early and is now a contributing editor at Jacobin, says. ""How could I not get involved with it?""

The magazine has been a constant supporter and promoter of the #RedforEd movement since it began in March 2018. This past week, it featured this article on charter school teachers in Oakland, California, supporting the current teachers strike there:

Negotiations are currently underway between the Oakland Unified School District and its teachers' union, which went on strike last Thursday. The strike started strong, with fewer than 10 percent of all students in school and 85 percent of teachers on the picket lines. And it has stayed strong, with pickets, mass rallies, and marches occurring every weekday.

Among many powerful displays of solidarity, from unaffiliated labor unions and devoted community members, one in particular stands out: teachers from ten charter schools across Oakland engaged in a wildcat sympathy strike.

The magazine also encourages readers to join ""reading groups"" across the country, which look remarkably like activist cells, and are located in many of the areas that have seen recent strikes, such as Denver, Colorado, Oklahoma, the San Francisco Bay Area, and North Carolina.

Oblivious to this obvious connection between Marxist revolutionaries and the teachers strikes, the Los Angeles Times wrote on Sunday they can find no connection between the recent spate of teachers strikes and broader political objectives, as Joel Pollak of Breitbart News noted:

The Los Angeles Times analyzed the ongoing wave of teachers strikes across California and the nation on Sunday, and determined that there is no broader movement -- even though ""#RedforEd"" organizers might beg to differ.

The phrase ""Red for Ed"" did not feature once in an extensive article by Anita Chabria and Sonali Kohl, though teachers on the picket lines have told Breitbart News directly they saw their strikes as part of that broader effort.

The Times explained the wave of strikes across California -- which was preceded by strikes in West Virginia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Colorado -- as the outcome of ""local problems"" that teachers happen to have in common:

""There's no doubt the L.A. Unified strike emboldened teachers in other parts of California and that teachers unions north and south have shared information with each other about their tactics. In Oakland, members of United Teachers Los Angeles were on hand to help with messaging and organizing. But teachers and labor leaders say there are unique problems at the district level that, in their view, will be addressed only if school administrators are confronted.""

Breitbart's reporting is in direct conflict to that of the the Los Angeles Times, as it is becoming more and more clear that the #RedforEd movement is a nationally coordinated effort driven by young socialists aligned with teachers unions.",665,Breitbart,#RedforEd Leader Writes in Marxist Magazine | Breitbart

In an interview with CNN, the 35-year-old also warned that he could be arrested upon his return, but said that such a move would only further mobilize opposition to the socialist regime.

""The exercise of politics in Venezuela is criminalized, not only towards me. Today there are 1,000 political prisoners in Venezuela, there are political assassinations,"" he said.

""We have the right to act, speak, think what we want without hindrance and restraint from our government,"" Diamond told the cheering crowd. ""We are one nation under God, baby.""

Then came another of many lines that would bring the crowd to its feet: ""I need for this Democrat Congress to understand that we don't need to rewrite the Constitution -- they need to reread the Constitution.""

""Understand that!"" Silk followed up, as the crowd roared with a sustained ""USA"" chant.

""And here is what I don't understand,"" Diamond came back.

""What don't you understand?"" Silk asked.

""When an illegal alien comes through that border illegally, the left advocates to help and support them,"" Diamond responded. ""But when an American baby comes through the birth canal legally, the left is advocating to kill them.""

Then, together: ""I have a problem with that.""

Senate Democrats on Monday blocked a Republican bill that would have threatened prison time for doctors who don't try saving the life of infants born alive during failed abortions, leading conservatives to wonder openly whether Democrats were embracing ""infanticide"" to appeal to left-wing voters.

All prominent Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls in the Senate voted down the measure, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The final vote was 53-44 to end Democratic delaying tactics -- seven votes short of the 60 needed.

Another area of focus for the Democratic Party that seemed to peeve the two commentators: the multiple investigations into alleged, but still unproven, improper Russia collusion by the Trump team.

""If you cared about democracy, you would have accepted the outcome of this election,"" Diamond said. (""That's right. Woo!"" Silk said as the audience again cheered.)

""You preach it, girl,"" someone shouted from the audience. Later, an audience member interrupted the two to insert the word ""sucks,"" loudly, after Diamond mentioned the word ""socialism.""

""They only smear who they fear.""

-- Diamond and Silk

Next on the agenda: taking on two leading Democratic presidential candidates -- U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- who have said they support reparations for black Americans affected by slavery, reflecting a shift in the importance of race and identity issues within the party.

""And to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren -- you can keep your reparations. You don't get to buy my silence,"" Diamond said. ""We will never let the Democrat Party to forget that they are the party of Jim Crow. They are the party of segregation. Never let 'em forget it.""

""We don't let 'em forget it,"" Silk said multiple times in response, to continuous applause. ""We want the ingredients to make our own cake,"" Diamond added.

Regarding fake hate crime hoaxes, Diamond and Silk had a simple message: ""When they try to play the race card, I want you all to stand up and play the Trump card so that we can win!""

Separately, the two implicitly slammed Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has repeatedly derided Israel's influence in the U.S. with what even Democrats called anti-Semitic attacks.

""Listen, we're not governed by sharia law, we're governed by constitutional law. ... We stand with Israel, and you need to know that,"" Diamond said. (Silk: ""Understand that! No sharia law! None of that!"")

After deriding Democrats as cynical political opportunists -- ""they only smear who they fear"" -- the duo's speech concluded on a patriotic and seemingly agreeable note.

"This is how stupid identity politics have made our country:

Virginia first lady Pam Northam apologized Wednesday after she handed out cotton to black children during a recent tour of the governor's mansion, the latest racial controversy involving the top levels of state government.

Northam handed out the cotton while showing students an adjacent cottage to the residence that had once served as a kitchen, asking them to imagine picking the crop as enslaved Africans.

""I regret that I have upset anyone,"" Northam said. ""I am still committed to chronicling the important history of the Historic Kitchen, and will continue to engage historians and experts on the best way to do so in the future.""

Her apology came after a Virginia state employee whose eighth-grade daughter and another black child were on the tour complained to lawmakers and Gov. Ralph Northam's office, The Washington Post reported.

What is the problem here? It is a historical fact that black slaves picked cotton on Virginia plantations. What is wrong with giving schoolchildren of whatever race a tactile sense of what raw cotton is -- this, as part of a tour explaining the history of the residence in antebellum times? What's next, Pam Northam having to apologize for wearing cotton sweaters?

According to the Washington Post, this is what happened. Excerpt:

Northam's office and one other parent of a child who was present said the first lady did not single out the African American students and simply handed out the cotton to a group.

... Trained docents often lead tours of the Executive Mansion, which was built with slave labor in 1813 and is the oldest active governor's residence in the country. In this case, Pam Northam -- a former middle school teacher -- took groups of pages to an adjacent cottage that had long ago served as a kitchen.

Before a huge fireplace with iron cooking implements, Pam Northam held up samples of cotton and tobacco to a group of about 20 children and described the enslaved workers who picked it.

""Mrs. Northam then asked these three pages (the only African American pages in the program) if they could imagine what it must have been like to pick cotton all day,"" Walker wrote. ""I can not for the life of me understand why the first lady would single out the African American pages for this -- or -- why she would ask them such an insensitive question.""

The governor's office, which did not make Pam Northam available for an interview, said she simply handed the cotton to whoever was nearby and wanted everyone to note the sharpness of the stems and leaves on the raw cotton, to imagine how uncomfortable it would've been to handle all day.

Jonathan Capehart, a black liberal Washington Post columnist, was triggered. Excerpt:

As an educational point, I get it: Having children touch and feel cotton to help imagine a time when handling the rough fiber was daily life during slavery isn't a terrible thing. It brings history into the present day. And Northam's stated belief that ""it does a disservice to Virginians to omit the stories of the enslaved people who lived and worked there"" is laudable. Where Northam ran off the rails was in handing the stuff to the African American children who were a part of the annual tour for state Senate pages and asking them that dumb question. Yes, I call it a dumb question, because for African Americans, cotton is not an abstraction. It is as integral to our family history as it is to the nation's.

After my mother read the story about Pam Northam, she wrote back, ""What is happening to these white people? Do they think slavery and poor black folks, black sharecropper were a game[?]""

In her statement of apology, Northam said, ""I regret that I have upset anyone."" Four hundred years after the first slaves arrived in Virginia, we have a right to expect better. I regret that neither Northam seems capable of moving this painful and necessary conversation on race forward.

Read the whole thing.

What's the lesson here? Best thing to do if you want to avoid being denounced as a racist is to stay in your room and never talk to anybody unlike yourself -- and certainly never try to empathize with people of other races. You will never, ever be given the benefit of the doubt. What a great country we're going to have once everybody has been forced to be entirely suspicious of everybody else!",668,The American Conservative,Everything Is A Trigger

SENATE GOP ULTIMATUM TO TRUMP ON EMERGENCY

Politico: ""Sen. Lamar Alexander delivered an ultimatum to President Donald Trump on Thursday: Reconsider your national emergency declaration at the border or face a potential rebellion from the GOP. The retiring Tennessee Republican declined to state whether he will become the deciding senator to block the president's maneuver, instead taking to the Senate floor to try and convince Trump that he has other ways to collect $5.7 billion for the border wall -- the precise amount of money he demanded during the government shutdown fight. 'He's got sufficient funding without a national emergency, he can build a wall and avoid a dangerous precedent,' Alexander told reporters afterward. 'That would change the voting situation if he we were to agree to do that.' Three other Republicans have said they would join Democrats in voting for a resolution to block Trump, and only one more is needed for the Senate to successfully reject Trump's declaration.""

Measure has bipartisan support - Roll Call: ""Sens. Susan Collins and Tom Udall have teamed up on the Senate version of legislation disapproving of President Trump's border security national emergency. Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico and an appropriator, said the resolution to terminate the national emergency isn't really even about the proposed border wall itself, saying on the Senate floor this is a matter of 'standing up for the Constitution.' He said the declaration was 'an end run around Congress's power to appropriate, plain and simple.' Collins, a Republican from Maine, followed Udall on the Senate floor, where she cited writings from both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison in the Federalist Papers, including when Madison described the power of the purse being reserved for the legislature as 'the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people.'""

Trump warns: 'Great jeopardy' for Republicans who oppose him - WaPo: ""President Trump warned Thursday that fellow Republicans who vote to nullify his national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border are putting themselves 'at great jeopardy' politically. Trump's comments come as the Senate prepares to vote on a measure aimed at thwarting the president's use of the declaration to direct billions of dollars more in funding to border barriers than Congress has authorized. 'I think that really it's a very dangerous thing for people to be voting against border security,' Trump said in an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity. 'I really think that Republicans that vote against border security and the wall, I think you know, I've been okay at predicting things, I think they put themselves at great jeopardy.'""

THE RULEBOOK: STATE OF STRENGTH

""I shall be told, that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be in theory, it is rendered harmless by the dependence of Congress on the State for the means of carrying them into practice; that however large the mass of powers may be, it is in fact a lifeless mass."" - James Madison, Federalist No. 38

TIME OUT: EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC

Commentary: ""'The age of criticism' -- that is what Randall Jarrell called the period between the 1930s and the early 1960s, a time when the power of literary criticism threatened to swamp the power of literature itself. In England, the magisterial T. S. Eliot was at work, as were F. R. Leavis, William Empson, I.A. Richards, and others. In America, Edmund Wilson was at the top of his game... The name missing from this roster of distinguished academic critics was the most famous of them all, Lionel Trilling. Then and now, Trilling doesn't seem quite to fit in anywhere. He was never entirely comfortable with Columbia University, where he taught for decades -- or, for that matter, with thinking himself an academic or even a critic. He was often listed among the group known as the New York Intellectuals... He wrote for the same magazines they did -- Partisan Review and Commentary here, Encounter in England -- but he was never fully in the mix.""

FIRST GLIMPSE OF 2020 MAP SHOWS PITCHED BATTLE

Sabato's Crystal Ball: ""Our initial Electoral College ratings reflect a 2020 presidential election that starts as a Toss-up. We start with 248 electoral votes at least leaning Republican, 244 at least leaning Democratic, and 46 votes in the Toss-up category. The omissions from the initial Toss-up category that readers may find most surprising are Florida and Michigan. Much of the electoral map is easy to allocate far in advance: About 70% of the total electoral votes come from states and districts that have voted for the same party in at least the last five presidential elections. With an approval rating in the low-to-mid 40s -- and, perhaps more importantly, a disapproval rating consistently over 50% -- it would be easy to say that President Trump is an underdog for reelection. ... He has done little to appeal to people who did not vote for him, and a Democrat who can consolidate the votes of Trump disapprovers should be able to oust him unless the president can improve his approval numbers in a way he has demonstrably failed to do in the first half of his term.""

Biden, Beto, Bernie look most competitive against Trump in Texas - Quinnipiac University: ""In a very early look at possible 2020 presidential matchups in Texas, President Donald Trump is essentially tied with former Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders or former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. President Trump leads other possible Democratic contenders by small margins. Hypothetical matchups by the independent Quinnipiac University Poll show: President Trump at 47 percent, including 41 percent of independent voters, to Biden's 46 percent, including 46 percent of independent voters; Trump at 47 percent, including 41 percent of independent voters, to Sanders' 45 percent, including 48 percent of independent voters; Trump at 47 percent, including 41 percent of independent voters, to O'Rourke's 46 percent, including 48 percent of independent voters. Trump has leads, driven mainly by a shift among independent voters, over other possible Democratic candidates: 46 - 41 percent over former San Antonio Mayor and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; 48 - 41 percent over U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California; 48 - 41 percent over U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.""

ROY MOORE THREATENS ANOTHER RUN

WashEx: ""Roy Moore, a conservative lightning rod who cost the Republican Party a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, is signaling fresh interest in mounting another campaign in 2020, sparking alarm on the right that Democratic Sen. Doug Jones could be gifted another unlikely victory. Moore, 72, a former state judge, made the rounds at last Friday's Alabama Republican Party dinner gala. A few days later, a new political action committee run by Moore's son, Caleb Moore, issued an email fundraising appeal. Republican insiders, including conservative allies of President Trump, fret that Moore -- derailed by sexual assault allegations in a 2017 special election that should have been an easy layup -- might divide the party in the primary and advance to a rematch with Jones. On Wednesday, a Moore confidant pointedly declined to rule out that his buddy might run for Senate next year.""

PELOSI: 'THIS IS NOT A DAY AT THE BEACH'

Politico: ""House Democrats held an emotional debate behind closed doors Thursday over how to stop losing embarrassing procedural battles with Republicans -- a clash that exposed the divide between moderates and progressives. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took a hard line at the caucus meeting, saying that being a member of Congress sometimes requires taking tough votes. 'This is not a day at the beach. This is the Congress of the United States,' Pelosi said, according to two sources. Pelosi also warned that Democrats who voted with Republicans on the 'motion to recommit' could become a lower priority for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, although her threat may be more bluster than reality, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the superstar New York freshman Democrat, suggested she would alert progressive activists when Democrats are voting with the GOP on these motions, said the sources. In the end, Pelosi and other top Democrats didn't agree to any rules change and will continue to study the issue.""

Won't commit to Green New Deal vote - Fox News: ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not commit to holding a vote on the Green New Deal touted by progressive lawmakers, saying Congress needs something that is 'evidence-based.' The sprawling Green New Deal proposal was recently put forward by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. The package is focused on income inequality and climate change, calling for a complete transition to clean, renewable energy -- but also including a host of far-reaching economic programs including guaranteed jobs. But while the plan has been embraced by numerous 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised questions about its multi-trillion-dollar price tag and the sheer logistics of implementing it. 'I can't say we're going to take that and pass it because we have to go through our checks and balances of it with our committee chairs and the rest,' Pelosi, D-Calif. ...""

Schumer's strategy: duck and cover - The Hill: ""Senate Democratic leaders are grappling over how to vote on a controversial climate change proposal that is being championed by progressives and mocked by conservatives. ... But Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) has floated a plan with his caucus to vote present on the ambitious legislation. It remains to be seen if Senate Democrats will embrace Schumer's strategy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday panned the Green New Deal as 'the far-left's Santa Claus wish list dressed up to look like serious policy.' The nonbinding legislation calls for the federal government to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, eliminate pollution as much as technologically feasible and provide training and high-quality education so that 'all people of the United States' can participate in the Green New Deal mobilization. McConnell says the Senate will vote on the Green New Deal before the August congressional recess.""

THE JUDGE'S RULING: THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUTION

This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains why he agrees with Speaker Nancy Pelosi's constitutional argument about Trump's national emergency declaration: ""Earlier this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a group of supporters and journalists that in her view, gun violence is the real emergency. Such a statement, in the context in which she made it, should send shivers down the spines of all who believe in personal liberty protected by the Constitution. Notwithstanding the terrifying analogy she made about gun violence -- terrifying to those who believe in the individual right to keep and bear arms as articulated by the Second Amendment and interpreted and upheld by the Supreme Court -- Pelosi wasn't really speaking about guns. She was speaking about the presidency and the Constitution."" More here.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

""Your musings were interesting about whether the early primaries serve or useful purpose or not, but I kept waiting for a conclusion of 'but that ship has sailed.'

Is that coming today, or did you miss the news about California having moved up its primary?"" - Steve Arthur, Arlington, Va.

[Ed. note: I think those are very different conversations, Mr. Arthur. California and Texas have certainly changed the nature of Super Tuesday, taking from a relatively low-wattage affair to a potentially make-or-break delegate bonanza. I tend to think that it will increase rather than decrease the value of the four early states. There will be less time for stumbles and resets. South Carolina may suffer, coming just three days before California. But I suspect that it will persevere, especially if Cory Booker establishes it, as I suspect he will, as an existential effort.]

""[T]hank you for not making the Cohen testimony your lead story.

[Ed. note: Don't misconstrue our coverage choices, Ms. Falk. This is a political newsletter, not one of general interest news, legal news, or congressional news. We really mostly care about what will shape the next election. We suspect that few, if any, minds were changed. Certainly, not yours! There's no doubt that the Mueller probe will have substantial 2020 consequences and we try to keep an oar in that water. But until then, we substantially see the accusatory, angry, speculative, reverse engineered fights over who said what and who leaked what to whom as mostly a waste of time aimed at keeping partisans engaged and barking up trees. It was a historic moment, though, no doubt. A sitting president's lawyer of a decade sitting before Congress accusing the chief magistrate of the U.S. government of massive corruption. Whatever your personal feelings about Cohen, I'd say that for those providing general news content, that would be too important to pass up.]

"Exciting news from the Catholic Diocese of Oakland, California:

A glass meth pipe and thong underwear found in a locked closet, a blindfold found inside a nightstand drawer, and sex toys found behind a mirror on the floor. Those are just a few of the items Livermore police detectives removed from the living quarters of Father Van Dinh inside the rectory of St. Michael Catholic Church as they investigated the priest for rape in 2017, according to a police report viewed recently by NBC Bay Area's Investigative Unit.

Days before detectives served that search warrant at the church, Dinh's accuser said the priest blindfolded and raped him inside the priest's bedroom. The former seminarian's accusations, equal parts horrific and bizarre, were detailed in the police report.

On Monday, Dinh's accuser filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Oakland and Bishop Michael C. Barber.

The media account identifies the accuser as ""John Doe"" to protect his identity. More:

Doe told NBC Bay Area that Dinh, who he considered a trusted spiritual adviser at the time, offered to set him up with a job as a receptionist at a friend's office. But before going to meet with Dinh's friend, the priest invited him for breakfast at the rectory of St. Michael, Doe said.

Doe says he was lured there under false pretenses.

""He sat me down in a chair and gave me a gift bag,"" Doe said. ""In the gift bag he had oils, and chocolate, and underwear. He grabbed me and he said, 'I want to give you a massage.' I was frozen. I was in shock.""

Doe says Dinh pushed him down on a mattress, took his clothes off, and began massaging his body with baby oil against his will.

""Dinh was breathing fast and started to say, 'Woody, Woody, what's your fantasy?'"" the civil complaint stated. ""In the past, Dinh had told Plaintiff he resembled the character ""Woody"" from the movie Toy Story.""

In vivid detail, Doe recounted being blindfolded, having his hands tied in front of him, and raped.

""I was frozen, I couldn't move,"" Doe said.

After the ordeal was over, Doe says Dinh told him to rest in bed while he made breakfast. That's when Doe said he ran from the rectory.

""Immediately after escaping Dinh's residence, Plaintiff drove to the residence of another priest and told him that Dinh had sexually abused him against his will,"" the civil complaint stated. ""The priest immediately reported the incident to Gloria Espinoza, a representative for the Diocese.""

Four days later, the Diocese alerted the police. Good grief, people, what's it going to take? You cannot trust the Diocese in these matters. Call the cops yourself!

""Woody, Woody, what's your fantasy?"" A meth pipe and sex toys. Nope, no gay priest problem in the Catholic Church, not at all.

I finished Frederic Martel's supposed blockbuster, In The Closet Of The Vatican, the other night. I wrote about the first 40 percent of the book last week, and promised to get back to you after I'd read the rest of it, which have to do with the pontificates of John Paul II and Benedict XVI. I've been trying to figure out what to say about the rest of the book. I was thinking of writing a lengthy analysis, but honestly, it's not worth it.

The book is a piece of trash, but more importantly, it is a massive blown opportunity to shed serious analytical light on a big, complex problem within the Catholic Church. Andrew Brown's generally favorable review in The Guardian gives you a general overview of the book. Excerpt:

Although he distinguishes sharply between homosexuality and paedophilia, Martel believes that life in the closet predisposes priests to cover up for each other. All institutions operate on loyalty and fear of scandal, but beyond those factors the Catholic church is full of men who feel neuralgic, he claims, about guilty secrets. Such men need not consciously conspire against the public; they just have an instinctive knowledge that the public need never know.

The most obvious complaint against Martel is that he can't prove much of what he alleges. He claims to have recordings of most of his interviews: one certainly wants to hear the moment when a prominent conservative cardinal's assistant refers to him as ""elle"". But such recordings couldn't for obvious reasons be published. Many of his most vivid informants are veiled in anonymity: one cardinal is referred to by the nickname of a famous prostitute, and so on. Perhaps this is inevitable. The gay and honest Dominican father James Allison once said that the Vatican is ""a honeycomb of closets"" where everyone's secrets are known, but only to a few.

Here's what is true and important in the book:

These are things that I, and many others who have read widely on the Catholic abuse scandal, and reported on it, have known for years are true. The problem is being able to document it. As I've said here many times, I knew that Cardinal McCarrick was guilty of molesting seminarians (but not the abuse of minors) back in 2002, and had several sources on the matter -- credible men, both priests and laymen, who were in a position to know. Not one of them would go on the record, or provide documents to back up their accusations. From a legal and professional point of view, my hands were tied. Other journalists knew what I did, and had to treat these allegations the same way.

If you allow yourself to report anything and everything you hear, and keep everyone anonymous -- giving living bishops and cardinals who have been accused false names -- then you can say anything without fear of a libel suit. This is Martel's style. But if that's the approach you take, then everything stands or falls on the credibility of the author's voice. The reader has to believe that you, the author, can be trusted. The author is saying to the reader, in effect, ""I'm going to take you on a tour of the Vatican's gay underworld. The only way you can go on this trip is to be blindfolded, but don't worry, you can trust me to describe the things around you as they really are.""

This is where Martel fails, and fails catastrophically. He is the very definition of the Unreliable Narrator. Look, I have no doubt in my mind that a lot of what is in Closet is true. The problem is that it's generally impossible to tell what is true, or probably true, from what is mere gossip, and unfounded rumor.

(That said, it seems that Martel is on fairly solid ground in his reporting about the late Cardinal Lopez Trujillo's brutal double life, and about homosexuality within the Cuban hierarchy -- a revelation that Martel indicates was the final straw for BXVI).

If Martel wrote with care or any sense of gravity, the reader would be able to trust him more. But he doesn't. He writes like a bitchy queen telling dishy stories at a piano bar. He is so driven by his homosexuality that he takes any information that confirms his priors as evidence. Much has been made about his anecdote reporting that the archtraditionalist Cardinal Burke's secretary used the French pronoun ""elle"" -- she -- in referring to the cardinal in the third person. A meaningful slip, according to M. Martel! But a priest who is a veteran of the Vatican told me that ""elle"" is correct ecclesial French for a cardinal, and that besides, the courtesy title for ""cardinal"" in Italian -- eminenza, which means ""eminence"" -- is a feminine noun in Italian. Martel was so quick to believe that this was a Freudian slip that he didn't even think about innocent explanations. This is a meaningful slip, all right, but on the part of the author Martel.

And Martel makes his cultural politics clear: he hates JP2 and BXVI, and adores Francis, because he sees Francis as opening things up for gays in the Church. When Francis criticizes homosexuality, Martel writes that off to the trifling prejudices of an octogenerian Argentine, and not to be taken seriously. He deeply believes that Francis is a revolutionary who is going to queer the Church -- and that's a great thing. One interesting thing about Closet: Martel praises Monsignor Battista Ricca, the scandal-ridden gay prelate who was rehabilitated by Francis, and credits Ricca for giving him hospitality and access to the Vatican. Funny, but there's not much discussion of Ricca's repulsive double life.

We also get nothing about the private life of Father Antonio Spadaro, the liberal Jesuit who is one of the key personal advisers to Francis, and whom Martel credits with helping him on this project. Maybe Father Spadaro lives like a perfect ascetic. But the absence of him in these pages, except to be praised lavishly, is curious. And you'd think that a book like this would have a lot to say about Theodore McCarrick's rise and fall. There's very little. A search of the book (I have the Kindle version) reveals that McCarrick's name turns up only 10 times in this 576-page book -- and each time is only in passing. This, to me, is a dead giveaway about Martel's agenda. How can you write a book about the Vatican's closet, and the abuses that emerge from this world, without writing something substantive -- or even speculative -- about how McCarrick made use of this system to advance his own career? Could it be because McCarrick is a well-known Francis supporter, and that Francis brought him out of the cold, so to speak, and gave him important missions for the Vatican?

In The Closet Of The Vatican could have been a serious work about a serious topic, but that would have required it to have been written by a serious journalist. The book is most meaningful, I think, because it represents a changing position from pro-LGBT advocates within the Church. We are starting to see now -- Stephen P. White elaborates here -- a new rhetorical tack from the Catholic Left. Now, rather than denying that the abuse scandal has anything at all to do with homosexuality in the priesthood, they're admitting that it does -- but saying the problem is the Church's teaching condemning homosexuality. One naturally sympathizes with Andrew Sullivan and other liberalizing Catholics who despise the personal hypocrisy of Church leaders who preach one thing in public, but who give themselves permission to live a contrary private life, whether promiscuous or partnered (Martel writes about both kinds). Those hypocrites deserve rebuke.

But the answer cannot be changing the Church's teaching on something as fundamental as human sexuality, especially homosexuality. I commend to you this long review of the book by Father James Alison, an openly gay Catholic priest who is cited favorably as a source in Martel's work. Alison endorses the book, and says that Martel is a credible storyteller. Alison writes:

A further point on this score. The subject of the book -- the dishonest living of homosexuality which structures clerical life -- is notoriously an area in and around which gossip flourishes. Discussion of this can therefore easily be dismissed as just that: mere gossip. Martel has clearly talked to many, many closeted clergymen, any number of whom have been prepared to dish on the lives of others (and the others, of course, on them). As far as I can see on reading the book, he tends not to attribute homosexuality or its practice to anyone merely on the basis of the bitchy asides typical of the pre-Stonewall clubhouse atmosphere he so accurately describes. Rather he has sought out multiple witnesses, and tried, where possible, to talk to the subjects involved to see what they would divulge. Forget canaries: Wagnerian divas would faint with envy at how long and how loud many of these men sang. Both by talking, and by trying to press their phone numbers upon the journalist's youthful male translators.

Sometimes I found the presence of insinuations and doubles entendres in the book troubling, maybe because it reminded me too much of my own experience. I remember a piece of South American gossip concerning a purported sexual relationship between myself and another member of the Order with which I was associated that is, as it happens, untrue. It could quickly have been debunked by anybody who had simply asked either of us and observed the evident hilarity with which each would have greeted the suggestion; or indeed, without going so far, by anybody who knew anything about my tastes. However, the purpose of the gossip was at least as much political manoeuvring as sexual insinuation, and those spreading it had no intention of, or interest in, determining whether it was true -- merely, whether it was useful.

In fact, there is no straightforward way an investigative journalist could navigate the clerical structure. In any ""total"" or oppressive r√©gime, insiders both survive and protest through humour: I'm old enough to remember the (temporary) collapse of Spanish political humour after Franco's death. Just so, inside the total world that is the clerical closet, it is difficult to know where bitchy survivalist humour and insinuation end and evidence begins. And therefore where a journalist might merely, and unhelpfully, be fanning fire-less smoke, and where he is demonstrating that something is genuinely smouldering just out of sight.

On the other hand, labelling something ""mere gossip"" can also contribute to cover-up. As long ago as 1987 I knew, as gossip, what turned out to be true about Father Marcial Maciel Degollado. I knew, as gossip, what turned out to be true about Bishop John Nienstadt a decade before it was established by professional investigators at the behest of Minnesota's legal system. I knew, as gossip, all about the famous McCarrick beach house long before it was confirmed in the wake of subsequent revelations.

Alison is right about all this. And yet, I simply don't understand why he finds Martel so credible. Had Alison written the same book, I suspect that he would have treated the material with far more seriousness than the flighty Martel. Alison goes on:

The overall picture that emerges from his book is astounding. I am an insider to all that is described; I have been living with the realities of it all my adult life; I have been trying to speak words to it publicly lo these many years. And yet, I had nothing close to an accurate sense of the size and density of the clerical closet and how much it distorts every aspect of the life of the Church. It's as if I had perceived an atoll at high tide, while Martel has revealed the volcano standing beneath. Stunned may be a much-overused word, but it's the best one I know to describe my wonderment at the dimensions of what has come into view.

Here's an interesting point. What Alison read in the book resonated with his personal experience as a gay priest and ""insider"" -- but at the same time, he says he had no idea about the ""size and density of the clerical closet."" In other words, Martel tells him something he never knew, because it resonates with things he already knew. What do we make of that? Again, a lot of us already knew the main claims of Martel's book. True, I'm a theological conservative, and a particular admirer of Benedict XVI (though an ex-Catholic), and I am the last person who needs to be convinced of the existence of a pervasive clerical closet -- and that theological conservatives are in it right along with theological liberals. It is not news to me that John Paul II turned a blind eye to a lot of terrible things -- worst of all, Marcial Maciel -- though Martel gets no closer than anybody else has to explaining why.

Even assuming that everything Martel reports is the gospel truth, I ended the book in the same place I began -- even on the question of the last two popes. I believe that JP2 was willfully blind to the sexual corruption around him, for three reasons: first, because Polish communists used accusations of homosexuality to try to discredit priests; second, if a priest was anti-communist, JP2 could not see beyond that; and third, because he could not bear to face that kind of corruption within the Church. That does not render JP2 blameless, but it does explain why a man of his sanctity could fail so miserably to deal with the evil right in front of his eyes.

On the question of Benedict, who did see more clearly -- Martel credits Ratzinger for moving aggressively against Maciel -- I believe that he was and is such an intellectual that he did not grasp the seriousness of the situation until he started getting post-Boston information from US dioceses when he was head of the CDF. A Vatican source of mine back then told me that the fax machine at the CDF was ""like an open sewer"" dumping information from American dioceses into the office every day. My source told me that it's easy for Americans to think that the Vatican knows everything, but they would be shocked to discover how antiquated and compartmentalized the Curia is. Running the CDF from Boston until his election as pope three years later radicalized Benedict.

But it didn't radicalize him enough, it seems. Or, to see it more charitably (and I have been told this by a clerical source who knows Ratzinger), Benedict himself did not understand how sexually corrupt the senior leadership of the Church was until near the end of his papacy. On Martel's telling, Ratzinger decided to resign after his trip to Cuba, and hearing firsthand how gay and active the Cuban clergy are. It was so shocking to him that the pope wept, says Martel. Like everything Martel reports, it's impossible to know how truthful that anecdote is, but the Cuba part of the book, like the Lopez Trujillo section, is one of the more solidly reported.

The source of mine who knows BXVI told me -- this was years ago -- that one day he realized that his enemies had him surrounded, and he had no power left with which to fight them. Recall that the traditionalist Catholic press has reported that the bishop who heads the Society of St. Pius X once personally challenged BXVI to use his authority as Pope to end the various crises in the Catholic Church. BXVI reportedly pointed to the entrance of his office and said: ""My authority ends at that door.""

Did that really happen? I don't know. But if it did, then that remark of Benedict's was an astute, if deeply depressing, observation about how power actually works in the Catholic Church. Or, if one were to be less charitable, it was a papal surrender. I remember hearing that and thinking, ""But why can't the Pope just go out and make a big speech, and tell the world what he's doing and why he's doing it?""

Well, if Martel's book is in any way reliable -- I know that's a big ""if"" -- the answer is that most of the men the pope would have depended on to execute his orders were so personally compromised that they would not have been able to without destroying themselves. Hence Benedict's resignation. My source -- and for transparency's sake, I'm telling you that this is only one source -- said that BXVI hoped that whoever the cardinals elected to follow him would have the stamina and support to clean out the Augean stables.

Back to James Alison's review essay -- which I genuinely encourage you to read. This part jumped out at me. It's from a section in which Alison tries to ""gaysplain"" (his word) why straight people are wrong to call for a system in which gay priests live by the same pledge of celibacy as straight priests. He writes (emphases below are mine):

This is where my ""gaysplaining"" is often difficult for straight people to understand. By comparison with the issue of first-person truthfulness concerning being gay, the issue of continence is, for most clerical gay men, nugatory. In the first place, despite the endless moralistic hullabaloo which surrounds them, sexual acts between consenting adult members of the same sex are about as inconsequential as any human activity can be. They harm no one, and produce neither babies nor any noticeable physiological or intellectual alteration in those participating. There is no noticeable difference between a monsignor who has a ""friend with benefits"" and a monsignor whose friend comes ""without benefits."" Furthermore, if Father X goes on holiday each year with his friend Brian, can anyone say whether they have sex or not? More to the point: who on earth could care! The matter has no discernible consequence.

This is not the same with straight people, where sexual acts can have notable consequences, and where the relationship between a man and a woman very quickly raises questions of justice, given that the woman will likely be the more economically vulnerable partner, and her childbearing years have an ""end by"" date. So Father Y going on holiday each year with his friend Sylvia, unless she is known as the sort of woman who loves the company of gay men, will raise eyebrows. Straight clerical incontinence is consequential in matters of justice and of reproductive possibilities in a way that gay clerical incontinence just isn't. This is not to make a claim about any of this being good or bad; it is merely to point out, in purely functional terms, that whether a gay clergymen is ""practising"" or not may be a matter of spiritual importance to him personally, but as regards the working of the clerical system, it is both invisible and irrelevant.

So, the presence of homosexuality in the clergy is not itself the problem, since homosexuality in itself is no more an indicator of paedophilia than heterosexuality. The question of whether or not any particular gay priest is ""practising"" has zero impact on the continued functioning of the system of mendacity. No, the really hard nut to crack, the one facing up to which is now ineluctable thanks, among other factors, to Martel's book, is the issue of honesty: truthfulness of life lived by sufficient numbers that blackmailability by the omert√† of badly-lived homosexuality is no longer a real threat.

I want to be careful here, because I don't want to attribute things to Alison that he does not believe. I am not sure whether or not James Alison believes gay sex among Catholic priests is good or bad. But the Catholic Church has a clear teaching on that matter. If gay priests do not want to live by that, and reserve to themselves the right to do what they want to do, because ""the matter has no discernible consequence"" -- well, they're wrong. This does have discernible consequences. And it has eternal spiritual consequences, unless the Catholic Church has been wrong about homosexuality for 2,000 years.

Ask yourself: if the Roman Catholic Church were to become in effect the Episcopal Church on matters of homosexuality, would Father Dinh's meth pipe and sex toys and rectory massages no longer exist? Would the Father Dinhs of the church no longer ask, ""Woody, Woody, what's your fantasy?"" because he would have found a nice partner and settled down to rectory life?

The argument that Martel and those like him make is that the closet drives gay men to behave like this. Think about it, though: homosexuality has ceased to be a stigma in much of the secular Western world. Is it the case that the normalization of homosexuality, including gay marriage, has made gay men in general more likely to adopt monogamous commitments? Do we have reason to believe that the end of the closet in our culture -- which I believe is a good thing overall -- means that gay men who enter the priesthood are going to be committed both to celibacy in their personal lives and upholding the Church's teaching in their pastoral work?

It's obvious that what Martel wants is for gay men in the priesthood to be free to live whatever kind of sexual life they want to live, and to do it openly, with the blessing of the Church. But that's Martel, an atheist. Is that the bottom line here for liberal Catholics, though? What kind of priesthood do they envision if they had their way? What kind of Church? I simply don't believe that liberal Catholic reformers will be satisfied until all consenting sexual activity is blessed by the Church.

If that were ever to come about, the Church would cease to be meaningfully Christian. It would be apostate. This is something that is happening all over the world today. If the Catholic Church and all Christian churches are going to uphold standards based in truth, sexual and otherwise, then they must prepare to endure a certain amount of hypocrisy in their ranks. Men, even men of the church, are not angels, and the church always and everywhere needs reform. But to throw the standards out because so many within the Church, including churchmen, find them hard to live by can never be acceptable.

I'll say this, with the gay atheist Martel and the gay liberal Catholic Alison: it is time for honesty, for a true reckoning. Every conservative Catholic I know believes this too. They are sick and tired of the self-serving lies from the cardinals, the bishops, and the priests.",671,The American Conservative,Inside Father Dinh's Closet
"We won't have Jason Witten to laugh at on Monday nights anymore now that he's returning to the NFL with the Cowboys after one year in the broadcast booth. Fortunately, we'll always have the memories. Below are five of our favorite moments of Witten's time with ""Monday Night Football"":

-- With the Oct. 15 telecast showing the 49ers producing a league-worst -10 turnover differential, Witten said, ""San Francisco can't keep kicking themselves in the foot like that."" It's shooting, Jason. Shooting.

-- Even the Pro Bowl went wrong for Witten. During the game, after Patrick Mahomes threw a touchdown pass to Eric Ebron, Witten said, ""Ebron was his guy all year."" The two hadn't played together all season. And in presenting the trophy afterward, he accidentally separated the top of the hardware from the base when giving it to Mahomes and Jets safety Jamal Adams, as he lifted it from the top.

-- It wasn't only the broadcast booth Witten struggled. During the college national championship game, ESPN put the ""Monday Night Football"" crew in its film-room broadcast. After Clemson called for a fair catch at its own 5-yard line on a kickoff, Witten wondered why the player did that, when in college a fair catch between the goal line and the 25-yard line results in a touchback. He was quickly corrected.

-- Witten said the NFL has become too ""left wing"" in protecting quarterbacks during an Eagles-Cowboys game.

""I knew they were going to make it about the health and safety and protecting these quarterbacks. It just seems like we went a little bit to the left wing on that with our approach on trying to protect it,"" Witten said. ""Not only are the players frustrated, but the coaches. They don't know how to coach this. That's when you have a challenge with this rule.""

ESPN would later say his comment had nothing to do about politics.

"Opposition leader Scheer issued a statement calling for Trudeau's resignation shortly after Wilson-Raybould delivered her testimony to the House of Commons.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer wrote.

""That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign,"" he continued. ""Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation - if it has not already done so - into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.""

The Toronto Sun agreed on Wednesday that the SNC-Lavalin case is now a matter for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

""After the first minute of Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony, it was already clear that this was a colossal bombshell,"" the Sun editorialized, presenting the former justice minister's opening statement as a concise summary of the case:

She began her opening remarks: ""For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

""These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) - from the Prime Minister's Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.""

That in itself was damning enough. Then Wilson-Raybould went on in detail to explain how she had repeatedly told these senior figures to not pressure her, that she had made up her mind, and that she thought the pressure was inappropriate. But they kept on doing it.

Wilson-Raybould testified that there was a ""barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" to avoid a criminal trial for SNC-Lavalin, including Prime Minister Trudeau and his senior aides. She said these people not only warned her about the dire consequences of a prosecution, including jobs lost for SNC-Lavalin employees and political fallout for the Liberal Party, but issued ""veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was ultimately pushed out of her position to make room for a more pliable justice minister. She said SNC-Lavalin was made the first order of business for her successor, David Lametti, in one of his first meetings with Trudeau.

SNC-Lavalin, one of the largest engineering firms in the world, was investigated for fraud and corruption due to its business practices in Libya, which was one of the company's largest clients under dictator Muammar Qaddafi. The company was accused of paying millions of dollars in bribes to secure business deals during the ten years before Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011. The company argues the wrongdoing was entirely the work of a single rogue executive named Riadh Ben Aissa.

If SNC-Lavalin as a whole is convicted on corruption charges, the company would be banned from bidding on Canadian federal contracts for ten years. Trudeau has publicly worried such a penalty could severely damage the company and eliminate a large number of jobs. He denies improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould to avoid prosecution.

Trudeau's principal secretary, Gerald Butts, resigned over the scandal two weeks ago, claiming he was innocent of wrongdoing but did not wish to bring further negative attention to the prime minister's office.

Former Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant, director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Globe and Mail on Thursday the testimony from Wilson-Raybould ""disclosed a constitutional crisis far worse than what I envisioned.""

""She says it was a bald attempt by the Prime Minister to exercise his cabinet-making power over her quasi-judicial authority. I am personally very familiar with the tactic, but have never seen evidence of it used on an attorney-general in this brazen, reckless fashion,"" he said.

Another former attorney general, Geoff Plant, found it deeply ""problematic"" that pressure against Wilson-Raybould continued after she clearly stated she did not support a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

""This observation crosses the line between inquiries that relate to the public interest, which are legitimate, and partisan political considerations, which are not. She was right to say that this was inappropriate. The fact that this consideration was raised again and again is very disturbing,"" he said, citing the importance of maintaining political independence for prosecutors.

Trudeau's defenders essentially argue his concerns about crippling the huge engineering company with a corruption prosecution were valid, and while he and his aides may have vigorously communicated that argument to the justice minister, their actions came up short of improper political interference.

Scheer completely rejected that reasoning in his statement on Wednesday, saying Trudeau has ""lost the moral authority to govern.""

Regarding Trudeau, he said:

A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

""As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends. Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he contended.

Writing at Maclean's on Wednesday, Paul Wells called Trudeau a ""moral catastrophe"" and said he was running a ""sickeningly smug protection racket"" for the Liberal Party's allies.

""If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification?"" he asked, referring to the elections looming when the SNC-Lavalin scandal began.

Trudeau said on Wednesday that he has no intention of resigning and suggested voters should have the final judgment on his actions in the October election.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said, as quoted by the Calgary Herald. He continued, ""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper, that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Kirk said that conservatives must understand, going into the 2020 election cycle, that the Left knows their attacks have not been working. ""They are now going to try to attack Donald Trump from within our own movement,"" said Kirk.

""If you want to get love from the Left -- be a conservative that attacks the most conservative president in our generation,"" continued Kirk, adding that conservatives ""should never, ever, try to appease the Left.""

""We must do what is right -- what is correct, and stand for the truth,"" said Kirk, ""This is the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan, if not in American history.""

""There's a lot to be concerned about,"" said Kirk of the youth in America, ""The socialist movement is growing.""

""For years, I tried to warn the conservative base that there was going to be a socialist under the age of thirty-five that was going to try to make these ideas mainstream,"" added Kirk, ""What happens on campus will soon come to Congress.""

Kirk stated that the fight against American youth being indoctrinated with socialist ideas ""will either make or break Western Civilization.""

"Imagine the reaction to a diet and exercise plan that claimed for just five minutes a day in the gym, you could consume six hours' worth of Twinkies a week. When it comes to food, people understand the need for discipline and balance between what goes into your body and how to process it.

But equally bad for the human soul is a steady diet of mass media and cultural consumption that compounds fear and worry over a world that can seem out of control - without counteracting those earthly concerns with a heavenward response.

To handle the kind of high-caloric anxiety so common in the 24/7 news driven world we live in, we need the exercise of prayer.

Just this month, Gallup released a poll saying that the highest percentage of Americans since 1939 believe that ""government, poor leadership or politicians"" are the nation's top problem. The 35 percent of Americans who shared that sentiment probably are among those who consume the kinds of news that can add to their anxiety. Adult news consumers spend nearly 6.5 hours a week watching cable TV news, yet so few of us spend much time in prayer to counteract all that we see and hear.

While almost 80 percent of Americans say they have prayed at least once in the last three months, that's not enough to overcome all that we deal with in daily life.

THE POWER OF PRAYER: SCIENCE PROVES IT WORKS, HAS POSITIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS

To prevent growing weary in our faith and losing hope as we face difficult and discouraging circumstances, we all need persistent and prevailing prayer. In fact, when Jesus wanted to encourage people to pray without ceasing, he used a parable about a widow needing justice from a corrupt, arrogant government official.

Being discouraged - even about politics - is nothing new, which is why Jesus taught his disciples in Luke 18 ""that they should always pray and not give up.""

As the story goes, ""In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'""

Eventually, faced with the widow's persistence, the unjust judge relented. Jesus taught that we must be just as diligent in bringing our concerns to a loving God as the widow was in seeking justice. The difference is that we have an Advocate who wants to hear from us.

In Matthew 7:9-11, Jesus reminded us that we have a Father in heaven standing by, saying: ""Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!""

'COLLEGIATE DAY OF PRAYER' AIMS FOR A 'SPIRITUAL AWAKENING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES'

Prayer is part of a relationship in which we spend time with a God who cares, getting to know him, listening as well as talking. It takes time. It's obvious that a couple who never spends more than a few minutes together each day, just handing off lists of things they want, won't last long when the hard times come because they are not deeply connected.

In the same way, we need to move beyond ""drive-by"" prayers, where our only interaction with God is to shoot off a few things we want as we hurry on our way.

The cares of this world are real. People are sick, hungry, struggling with addiction, unemployment, loneliness and a thousand other things that wake us up in the night and burden our every thought, in part because we know that we are often helpless to handle all of this alone. Some things seem impossible to fix, but prayer changes things.

"Here's a sentence I never thought I would write: Dianne Feinstein was right.

A small group of middle- and high-school children from the San Francisco Bay area visited the Democratic senator from California last week to demand she support the ""Green New Deal,"" a collection of environmental policies even some Democrats find too extreme, too costly and too fantastical.

What followed was the kind of lecture that is almost absent in a modern culture that overemphasizes youth.

CAL THOMAS: FLORIDA'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING WHILE BLUE STATES LIKE NEW YORK ARE MIRED IN DEBT -- WHY IS THAT?

One of the students, an unidentified 16-year-old, was quoted by The Washington Post: ""...we have come to a point where our Earth is dying, and it is literally a pricey and ambitious plan that is needed to deal with the magnitude of that issue, so we're asking you to vote 'yes' on the resolution for the Green New Deal because...""

Feinstein interrupted: ""That resolution will not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here."" She added, ""I know what can pass, and I know what can't pass.""

Behind the student group is an organization known as the Sunrise Movement, which describes itself as ""...a movement to stop climate change and create millions of new jobs in the process."" There is more gobbledygook about an army of young people who are scared about the ""climate crisis"" and the familiar condemnation of fossil fuels, corporate executives and ""their influence on our politics.""

In other words, they are environmental extremists.

Sunrise criticized Feinstein for being callous toward the young people. In fact, this grown-up gave them a reality lesson.

Another child, and that's what they are according to the law and biology, one Alexandria Villasenor, a 13-year-old seventh-grader, has spent the last nine Fridays sitting on a bench outside the United Nations in New York demanding action on climate change. On March 15 (beware the Ides of March), she will be part of a ""school strikes for climate"" demonstration. The Post reports the worldwide demonstrations will be supported by some of the world's biggest environmental groups.

How does a 13-year-old, and other teens, acquire such knowledge? Most likely they are simply parroting what their teachers have been telling them. Climate change is simply the latest fad, like tattoos and body piercing once were.

When I was their age, skipping school meant a call to my parents from the principal's office with quick punishment to follow.

The problem in too many of our public schools, universities and much of culture is that we have handed over control to people who don't know what they are talking about. Adults -- at least ones thought to have acquired wisdom, which is different from knowledge -- were once tasked with leading the young. Now, in too many instances, we seem to be following them.

A statue of Spain's King Felipe VI is being sold for $230,000 with one condition - the buyer will have to burn it - igniting uproar among supporters of the monarchy.

The 14 feet-tall statue features the country's king standing tall and wearing a dark blue suit, green tie and white shirt. It's exhibited at Madrid's ARCO contemporary art fair.

But anyone interested in purchasing the statue will have to also legally commit to setting it ablaze, said Santiago Sierra and Luis Navarro, the artists behind the statue.

""The specificity of this sculpture is that it isn't conceived to endure in time, to be collected, but for the pleasure of being destroyed,"" Navarro told AFP, noting that any buyer will have to ""commit to the artwork being burnt.""

The artists sparked an uproar in Spain, particularly among the conservative press that harbors more sympathetic views towards the monarchy.

Some media outlets called the statue a ""provocation"" because the king himself will be opening the fair on Thursday, The Local reported.

Sierra has previously been embroiled in controversy for his political works, according to the outlet. Last year, the artist called jailed Catalan separatist leaders as ""political prisoners"" in an art installation, prompting the removal of the installation from the same fair.

Foodwatch released a letter and petition to both Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila and European Council President Donald Tusk claiming that the partnership with Coca-Cola was collusion between political elites and corporate interests, L'Obs reports.

""This collusion between EU bodies and corporate interests further undermines citizens' confidence in European politics and decision makers, while on the contrary, it is essential to strengthen transparency and democracy in Europe,"" the group said.

""The presidency must be neutral and impartial during the period of the exercise of the mandate,"" Foodwatch added and noted that the European Union will be looking into issues affecting Coca-Cola in the coming months.

""Policymakers in the European Union will have to consider, for example, the revision of food law, as well as the important issue of nutrition labelling on food packaging,"" they said and added, ""this type of sponsorship is part of a lobbying strategy to counter the implementation of such measures.""

"President Trump talks peace during North Korea summit while Democrats focus on the drama surrounding Michael Cohen.

I want you to remember what happened on Wednesday. What took place is a defining moment both in Vietnam and back in Washington in American politics. Because what we witnessed were two radically, distinctly different agendas that have been now laid bare for all to see. At the very same moment, a historic summit with the president of the United States, who traveled 20-plus hours to Vietnam for a second summit negotiating a safer world for our kids and our grandkids.

What were the Democrats in Washington doing? They purposely scheduled and hauled in Michael Cohen for an the entire day of televised testimony. Why? Just to embarrass the president they have this psychotic hate for.

On the very day President Trump holds this historic, high-stakes summit -- the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, no more rockets being fired all over that part of the world, no more threats to America, to Guam -- House Democrats had a more important agenda. They wanted to embarrass the president while he was in negotiations and put on a circus, a spectacle in Washington, D.C.

So, I want you to just embrace the magnitude of this, this moment, because Democrats clearly showed their true colors. This should have been a day no red, no blue, no conservative, no liberal, no Republican or Democrat. It's should have been about safety and security for all of us.

You know what? If a rocket hits some country and innocent people die, well, we could have stopped it. Because we now have clear evidence revealing exactly what Democrats care about and what they don't care about. Make no mistake about this. Safety and security of we -- you the people -- is certainly not at the top of their list.

What we saw in Hanoi was an American leader fighting to make the world a better, safer place. What we saw in Washington, all day on Wednesday, nonstop, was the Democratic Party, a hyperventilating, hysterical media, putting politics over country with a political charade designed to just embarrass and trash the president while he represents our country abroad.

They could have put off these Cohen hearings until the next week. Instead, this insatiable hatred of the president, it now consumes all of their actions, all of their thoughts, every second, every minute, every hour, of every day, of every month, and frankly, every year since 2015, when Donald Trump came down that escalator in Trump Tower.

That's why the House Oversight Committee called on Michael Cohen, who was convicted of lying to Congress, to once again testify now before Congress. And it was just petty, partisan politics. It was a circus.

Here's the problem. Democrats don't care one bit about Michael Cohen and his family, not at all. They were the ones calling him every name in the book until fairly recently. Now, as a result of their partisan hatred of Trump, they may have put him in further legal jeopardy with the Southern District of New York that seemed pretty mad at him already, on issues involving inconsistencies.

For nearly seven hours under oath at the request of House Democrats, Michael Cohen was, frankly, used by Democrats on this historic day to advance what is now a psychotic hate-Trump mob that exists in this country. Yet during all the testimony, we saw no evidence of Trump/Russia collusion, we saw no evidence of crimes committed by the president. Nothing. In fact, Michael Cohen himself actually shot down some of the hate Trump media mob's favorite conspiracies. I'm sure this is hurting them a little.

Without a doubt, Michael Cohen has been through a lot. He pled guilty to multiple felonies. He's lost his law license. He's now facing three years in prison. There was absolutely nothing for him to gain from Wednesday's political theater. But that's no concern to the radical far left Democratic Party, the ones that are so compassionate. They're willing to smear, slander, besmirch anybody, at any place, at any time.

"Most of Michael Cohen's testimony was dedicated to the question of President Trump's character.

There was a lot going on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The circus came to town. President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified for most of the daylight hours, and everybody carried it. You probably heard snippets in the Uber on the way to work - you've got a real job. So, we watched every moment because we are paid to do that.

And most of the day was devoted to the question of Trump's personal character. Now, people in Washington never tire of being shocked by what an incredibly bad man Donald Trump is. They are incredibly good people, and they can just hardly believe his flaws. They sat open-mouthed in the Congress as Michael Cohen described his former boss as -- brace yourselves now -- a bit of a conman who has, at times, overstated his personal wealth.

In private, Trump apparently has said offensive things. At one point, Michael Cohen claims, Trump used a straw buyer to bid up a portrait of himself at a charity auction. He wanted his picture to go for the highest price.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.

Whoa. Are you shocked yet? Can you believe it? Of course, you can. This is exactly we knew back in 2015 when he descended the famous escalator, and yet millions of people voted for him anyway. His character was not the point.

The point of Wednesday's hearings was not his character, either. It was supposed to be Russian collusion and obstruction of justice. Those are the topics that have completely derailed the American government for the past two years. And on those subjects, we actually did learn quite a bit.

Here is one example. About a month ago, the cat blog, BuzzFeed, ran an article that claimed Trump had ordered Michael Cohen to lie to the Congress. That is a big deal. It is a crime. And so immediately, the hysterics in the Congress and on cable news went bonkers. Impeachment! Indictment! Life in prison!

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

But did that actually happen? Well, since Cohen was there, in person, he was able to conclusively answer that question during the hearing and he did.

He admitted that Trump never directed him to lie to Congress. So, it looks like Trump will not be going to jail for suborning perjury after all -- darn, foiled again! Look for a retraction in the latest edition of BuzzFeed. You'll find it just below the 15 cats that look like Ruth Bader Ginsburg listicle. Look carefully.

But what about Russian blackmail? You have been hearing about that for years. Trump, they have told you, again and again, has somehow been compromised by the Russians. And that is why he has been spying for them. Putin has something horrible and incriminating on Donald Trump -- he must. A picture of the president in a ""Batman"" costume maybe, or a videotape with hookers doing something weird.

Certainly, Michael Cohen would know about that kind of thing -- that is his world. Luckily, a sitting member of Congress asked Cohen about it directly.

""Are you aware of anything that the president has done at home or abroad that may have subjected him to or may subject him to extortion or blackmail?"" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., asked

""I am not, no,"" Cohen said.

""Okay, are you aware of any videotapes that may be the subject of extortion or blackmail?""

""I've heard about these tapes for a long time,"" Cohen said. "" I've had many people contact me over the years. I have no reason to believe that that tape exists.""

Keep in mind that Michael Cohen is Trump's personal lawyer of 10 years. He now hates Donald Trump and would like to destroy him ... If Michael Cohen had the dime, he would drop it. But he doesn't. There is nothing there. It was all a lie. Can we go home now?

Thanks, Mr. Raskin for clearing that up. So the ""pee tape"" is not real. There goes the juiciest part of the Trump dossier, which you will remember was yet another highly publicized scoop from, yes, BuzzFeed. Good time to get back to those cat videos, fellows.

But wait, what about the trip to Prague that Michael Cohen supposedly took that was part of his collusion with dark forces of the Russian empire? That was in the dossier as well. BuzzFeed told us about it. Surely Cohen would admit it now. He's heading to prison. He has got nothing to lose. Well, Cohen was asked about the Prague trip -- and he said he's never been to Prague, never been to the Czech Republic in his life.

This is where it gets confusing. Never been to Prague. This is the point at which what they call the ""narrative"" starts to break down a little bit. If Michael Cohen never went to Prague, as BuzzFeed and Adam Schiff and the entire primetime lineup of MSNBC, have told us repeatedly that he did, then how exactly did Michael Cohen collude with the Russians to steal the 2016 presidential election from its rightful winner, Hillary Clinton?

Well, that is a good question, isn't it? Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida, as incisive an interviewer as the Democrats have, wondered that, too. ""Based on what you know, would Mr. Trump or did he lie about colluding and coordinating with the Russians at any point during the campaign?"" she asked.

Cohen responded with the following: ""So as I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word 'colluding.' Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin? Yes, but I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion.""

Oh, wait, so there is no collusion. There is no Russian blackmail. There is no obstruction of justice. There are none of the things that our entire media class has spent the last two years huffing and speculating wildly about.

Keep in mind that Michael Cohen is Trump's personal lawyer of 10 years. He now hates Donald Trump and would like to destroy him. He has said that again and again. If Michael Cohen had the dime, he would drop it. But he doesn't. There is nothing there. It was all a lie. Can we go home now?

Nope, we have got two more days of stuff just like this. Two more days of exchanges where members of Congress will be able to prove that they are not only dumber than you thought they were, but they are a lot creepier. Exchanges where they ask things like, is there a love child? Is he a dope head? Did he pay for abortions?

Cohen replied no, no, and no on all accounts. By the end of the hearing, you start feeling kind of bad for Michael Cohen, honestly. He's not a genius. Anyone who knows him will affirm that. He is in his 50s now, and he is headed to prison -- and that is a long way from where he expected to be. Cohen showed up in Washington two years ago anticipating that he would be the kind of guy, the kind of mover and shaker, who would be welcome at any restaurant in town. Part the seas for Michael Cohen. Now, he is going to be eating sloppy joes off of a metal tray with a thousand other creeps in an identical polyester uniform in the lockup.

So, take the politics out of it for a minute, if you can. Let's be honest. This is a sad story. Michael Cohen is a broken and desperate man. But nobody cares. Democrats cheered for his conviction on ludicrous, absurd campaign finance charges, as if paying off somebody's girlfriend is a campaign finance violation. It is laughable, but they don't care.

Now, they are squeezing whatever use they can out of Michael Cohen as he shuffles off to his cell. What do the rest of us get out of this? We learn that Trump is vain and vulgar. Okay, what do we do with that information? Is it supposed to make us support open borders? Late-term abortion? The war in Syria? The Green New Deal? Will it make the drug epidemic go away? Will it make the suicide rate drop? Will it make housing affordable in the cities? What does that have to do with anything?

Well, it doesn't have anything to do with anything, and that is exactly the point of it. That is why this is going on forever. The more time they waste yelping about Trump's charity auction scam and his naughty language in private, the less time they have to explain why they have run this country into the ground and gotten rich doing it.

"It happens more often than you might think -- and sometimes the state is a close one.

The 2020 presidential election could be decided by one state, most likely Wisconsin or Pennsylvania. How often has that happened? Let's take a walk through the history of presidential elections.

In 58 presidential elections since 1788, 19 -- almost a third -- have been close enough that the outcome would have been different if at just one key state had gone the other way. In nine of those 19, it was only one state that was big enough to make the difference. Some of those single states were very close, but others weren't. For example, the only state in Donald Trump's 2016 coalition big enough to decide the election for him by itself was Texas, decided by almost a nine-point margin. At the other end, five elections have been close enough that there were more than three states in the winner's coalition that could have changed the outcome by going the other way.

The closeness of decisive states is hardest to determine in the first nine elections, from 1788 to 1820. Fewer states chose electors by direct popular vote in the earliest elections, and reliable popular-vote totals are hard to come by.

We do know that three elections in this period were close enough to be decided by a single state. The 1796 and 1800 contests between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were both decided by margins small enough (a one-electoral-vote win for Adams, a three-electoral-vote win for Jefferson) that several states could have swung the election. In 1812, James Madison's 19-electoral-vote margin would have vanished had he lost either Pennsylvania or his home state of Virginia. The 1812 election was the first time that New York passed Virginia as the state with the most electoral votes (the three-fifths clause held back Virginia's electoral weight, given its significant slave population) and spelled the beginning of the end of Virginia's dominance of presidential elections.

American elections became much more contentious and closely contested as the one-party dominance of 1800-1824 broke up and the franchise expanded to more voters. Half of the elections between 1824 and 1892 would have had a different outcome if just one key state had gone the other way. Only one of those was close enough that more than three states could have been decisive: the 1876 election, settled by a corrupt deal to end Reconstruction in exchange for counting all the Reconstruction governments' disputed vote tallies for the Republican, Rutherford B. Hayes (including that of the most closely divided state, South Carolina).

The most closely divided state in this period was frequently Maryland, a border state that allowed slavery but stayed in the Union in the Civil War. (Maryland also often had eccentric ways of dividing its electoral votes.) Other than in 1836, when Virginia was one of three states essential to Martin Van Buren's victory, the one or two states big enough to decide the elections in this period were always New York or Pennsylvania. The 1884 election produced the ultimate decisive state: The largest state, New York, was also the most closely divided (the two candidates were just a tenth of a point apart), it was the only state that would have changed the outcome by going the other way, and the winner of the state and the election was New York's sitting governor, Grover Cleveland.

The era from 1876 to 1892 had seen the decline of the Lincoln/Grant Republican coalition, but William McKinley oversaw the rise of a new Republican majority that dominated American politics from 1896 to 1928, after which it was displaced by a dominant Democratic majority. Only the Taft-Teddy Roosevelt split between Republican conservatives and progressives in 1912 gave Democrats a brief period in power under Woodrow Wilson. As a result, there was only one truly close presidential election between 1896 and 1956, that of 1916, which resulted in Wilson's re-election over a reunited Republican party headed by New York's Charles Evans Hughes. It was the only election out of 16 in which any one state could have changed the outcome.

Hughes carried the nation's three largest states (New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois), so Wilson's victory rested among a lot of medium-sized or smaller states. The largest states Wilson won were Ohio, Texas, and Missouri. Interestingly, turnout in Illinois exceeded that in New York, making this the only election from 1832 to 1964 where New York did not cast the most popular votes. Missouri and Kentucky, both border states, were the most common closely divided states in this period.

Franklin Roosevelt's four elections, by contrast, were so decisive that his Republican opponents didn't win enough electoral votes between 1932 and 1944 combined to win one election.

That brings us to our own era. Since 1960, six out of 15 elections -- 40 percent -- have been close enough to be decided by a single state. The 2000 election is the most notorious example, with not just Florida but every state won by George W. Bush being essential to his election. Four elections -- John F. Kennedy's win in 1960, Richard Nixon's in 1968, Jimmy Carter's in 1976, and Trump's in 2016 -- depended on one big state. California took over after 1968 as the largest state, and was the decisive element in the election of Nixon as the first Californian president.

Of course, a decisive state is not necessarily a close one. In an even more extreme example than Trump and Texas, James Buchanan's victory in 1856 depended on his home state of Pennsylvania . . . which he won by 18.1 points. Let's turn to the closest states that were big enough to swing an election.

The top rows on this chart just show the decisive states by size; from 1836 on, they are ranked by the closest margins among the decisive states. Only 1876 and 2000 had multiple decisive states where the winner's margin of victory was less than two points. It's forgotten now, but Al Gore in 2000 also won four states by less than half a point: New Mexico, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Oregon. Gore won New Mexico by 366 votes. Two of those four went to Bush in 2004. Nether Oregon nor New Mexico has been close again since Bush left office.

New York, then the largest state in the union, was decisive in three straight elections from 1880 to 1888 in which its outcome was decided by less than two points. That explains why Democrats in that era were eager to run New Yorkers such as Cleveland and Samuel Tilden. Besides Nixon, Cleveland, Buchanan, and Madison, other candidates who would have lost their races without their home states were Jefferson, Van Buren, Hayes, John Adams, and George W. Bush (twice). Wilson won by the margin of his birth state of Virginia, but lost the state he had governed, New Jersey. Gore, Cleveland in 1888, and Winfield Scott Hancock in 1880 would all have won if they had carried their home states. Trump, of course, won without even competing in his home state.

The closest state that was decisive in the 1916 race was California, with 13 electoral votes. Hughes, who had quit the Supreme Court to run, actually went to bed on Election Night thinking he had won, but late returns from the West Coast gave the race to the incumbent.

Finally we come to the tally of which states have been the most closely divided -- decisive or otherwise -- the most times. Twenty-nine of the 50 states have claimed that honor at least once, and, as noted above, the roll of states that have done so the most often is dominated by border states (Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky). The other frequent appearance is California, though it will likely be a very long time before that happens again.

It's early yet to be sure of the 2020 landscape, and anyway, that's another day's column. But history tells us that elections often do come down to just one state, sometimes a very close one.",684,nationalreview.com,How Often Is One State Decisive in the Electoral College? | National Review
"An excerpt from a new book, a remarkable collection of commentaries on his speeches there

Reagan at CPAC is a remarkable collection of commentaries on the speeches of President Ronald Reagan at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, and it provides for current and future generations a review of his exceptional impact on conservatism in America. I appreciate this opportunity to offer a few reflections on those speeches and their continuing relevance today.

What is considered the modern conservative movement developed in three overlapping phases: intellectual, political, and governing. Each phase had an important relationship to Ronald Reagan's speeches.

Shortly after the end of World War II, a number of leading scholars, such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, became concerned about the spread of socialism and similar collectivist doctrines in both academic and political circles. To provide a counter force to such harmful concepts, they worked together to pursue a vigorous program of writing and speaking in support of ""classical liberalism."" In 1947, they organized the Mont Pelerin Society, which became a rallying point for similar thinkers throughout the world. Hayek's famous book condemning socialism, The Road to Serfdom, became widely read.

In the 1950s, the more senior scholars were joined by a brilliant young Yale graduate, William F. Buckley, who popularized the conservative message through articles, books, speeches, and a television debate show, Firing Line. One of Bill Buckley's most significant achievements was the founding of National Review, a highly literate but informative and entertaining journal of conservative ideas.

Through these efforts, conservatism became an intellectual movement that spread from the institutions of higher learning to widespread forums of public discussion and debate. Ronald Reagan was a voracious reader and became interested in a variety of books on liberty, constitutionalism, free-market economics, and similar topics. His views turned away from liberalism, and the products of conservative thought became the foundation of his political principles and philosophy and, ultimately, the content of his speeches.

In 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater ran for the presidency as the Republican candidate on a staunchly conservative platform. Although he was not successful, his campaign established a series of robust policy positions as their ideological agenda. They also attracted a large body of adherents, including many young people, who were eager to support the politics of liberty and limited government. This became the base of conservatism as a political movement.

As described in Reagan at CPAC, one other result of the Goldwater campaign was the emergence of Ronald Reagan on the national political scene. In October of 1964, he gave a national television speech that electrified its viewers and raised over five million dollars for the Goldwater election effort. The speech, ""A Time for Choosing"" (also known as ""Rendezvous with Destiny"" and ""The Speech""), dealt with the failure of big government with its oppressive bureaucracy, high taxes, and burdensome regulation. It extolled freedom, limited government, and citizen responsibility. The success of the speech encouraged political leaders in California to recognize Reagan's potential as a candidate for office and led to the next phase of conservatism.

In 1966, Ronald Reagan ran for governor of California, winning against a highly popular incumbent by nearly one million votes. By accomplishing two successful terms as governor, leading the National Governors' Association, and later serving two successful terms as president, he established conservatism as a governing movement. In these leadership positions, Ronald Reagan proved that conservative ideas and actions actually worked in practice. As both state and national leader, he entered office to face daunting challenges of fiscal and economic crisis, bureaucratic management failure, and the threat of high crime, as well as public discouragement. But in each position, Reagan's leadership ability, cheerful and optimistic spirit, and persuasive communication skills enabled him to rebuild financial stability, restore sound government, and reestablish public confidence in our institutions.

One challenge that is unique to the presidency is the responsibility for national security and the conduct of foreign affairs. When Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as president, major problems in these areas faced America and were often discussed in his CPAC speeches. As related in several of the commentaries, the president identified Marxism-Leninism as an evil force in the world and decried the plight of the captive nations and the oppression that so many suffered under totalitarian rule. But his remarks always included messages of optimism and hope as well as his commitment to work for positive change. He espoused a strategy of peace through strength, support for freedom fighters around the world, contention against Soviet aggression, and action to ultimately free those imprisoned behind the ""iron curtain.""

When he gave his last speech at CPAC as president of the United States, Ronald Reagan did not know when that day of victory and liberation would be achieved, but he was confident that his strategy and initiatives were moving the world toward the attainment of those goals. It was not long before his steadfast actions resulted in the ultimate victory in the Cold War and the implosion of the Soviet Union.

Ronald Reagan's speeches at CPAC are part of the history of the modern conservative movement and are linked to the phases I have described. He reminded us of the ideals and values that have guided our republic through more than two centuries of progress and trial in our quest to preserve freedom and assure justice. His words have challenged us in the past and inspired us for the future. Ed Feulner, founder of the Heritage Foundation, in his book The March of Freedom, described the president this way:

Ronald Reagan is called the ""Great Communicator,"" and with good reason. He has a profound appreciation for the importance of rhetoric. . . . He is persuasive because he is so deeply persuaded of [conservative] ideas himself. . . . He boiled down politics to its most fundamental level and spoke a plain language of right and wrong.

Ronald Reagan has given us a legacy of great speeches that express the permanent convictions of the conservative movement and are an invaluable tribute to his continuing influence among lovers of freedom.",685,nationalreview.com,Reagan at CPAC | National Review
"President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will leave Hanoi without a new deal on Thursday.

The media are already playing the result as a loss for Trump, and his critics are mocking his purported skills as a deal-maker. That only shows how little they understand negotiation.

""No deal"" is better than a bad deal -- and the best way to get a good deal is to show that you are willing to walk away if the other side cannot make concessions.

That is something President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State John Kerry never understood, which is why the Iran nuclear deal was such a disaster. As the Iranians made more demands, the allies made more concessions, and the Obama administration was reduced to arguing that the only alternative to accepting the deal was war. In the end, Obama subverted his own country's Constitution, evading the Senate and using the UN to impose the deal.

The prospects for a deal looked good in Hanoi until the end. Kim Jong-un told reporters that he had accepted the principle of denuclearization. The devil was in the details.

Trump played the meeting well, making it clear that he wished to have good relations with North Korea. In the end, Trump said, the North Koreans wanted a total lifting of sanctions in return for partial denuclearization. He said no.

The example of Ronald Reagan walking away from Mikhail Gorbachev at Reykjavik comes to mind.

The two sides will meet again.

In the interim, the media ought to engage in some overdue introspection. They predicted Trump would not hold firm. They were wrong.

Having reporters shout at Trump about Michael Cohen's testimony on Capitol Hill -- amplifying Democrats' efforts to bring down the president -- weakened Trump's leverage in negotiations.

The principle that politics stops at the water's edge ought to apply to journalists, too. More is at stake than clicks and retweets.",686,Breitbart,Pollak: 'No Deal' Is Better than a Bad Deal with North Korea | Breitbart
"The reflecting pool at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York. Paul Martinka

Thursday night inside the 9/11 Memorial Museum, the heads of various sports leagues will convene for the first time together since the horrific Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to commemorate a special exhibit in the museum called ""Comeback Season: Sports after 9/11.''

Former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue will be there. Former NBA commissioner David Stern will be there. So, too, will current NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Val Ackerman, who was the president of the WNBA at the time and is now the commissioner of the Big East Conference.

The event, which is open to the public, is titled, ""When is it OK? Restarting sports after 9/11,'' and it's certain to stir some powerful memories and remind everyone that nothing in sports -- particularly as it relates to the fan experience -- is as it was before the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.

That day, for as tragic as it was with the lives lost, marked an end of innocence of sorts for sports.

As fans, it's difficult to enter a stadium today, particularly for higher-profile events, without at least a fleeting thought about whether that stadium might be a target for terrorism. The metal detectors and pat-downs at each gate won't allow you to forget.

As the sun rose the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, the NFL had just completed its season's first week and was five days away from Week 2 games being played. Baseball was in the throes of September pennant races.

Both sports provided dramatic emotional lifts to New York that remain as etched into our memories as any championships won.

Mike Piazza's dramatic home run for the Mets in the first sporting event played in New York following the attacks 10 days prior remains one of the most iconic moments in our sports landscape.

Jets players, led by Vinny Testaverde and Wayne Chrebet, informing the NFL that if games were played the Sunday after the attack the team would forfeit remains an indelibly moving moment.

President George W. Bush throwing out the first pitch in Game 3 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium will never be forgotten.

Nor will Mark Messier wearing the helmet of fallen firefighter Raymond Downey during pregame introductions at the Rangers' home opener that October.

All of these moments are chronicled in the special exhibit and they will serve as a backdrop when Tagliabue, Stern, Ackerman and Bettman speak from 7 to 8:30 Thursday night (tickets, $20 for the general public and $10 for museum members, can be purchased at 911memorial.org).

""All I know is that Nelson Mandela was right when he said that sports could bring people together, and that was what was necessary post 9/11,'' Stern told The Post this week.

""Sports can be a salve in moments of crisis like that,'' said Ackerman, who lived 11 blocks from Ground Zero. ""They're not the most important thing, but they can help the healing process. The challenge of commissioners was to find that right balance.''

Both Tagliabue and Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner at the time, handled it the right way by restarting at the right times. The NFL postponed its Week 2 games. Baseball waited a week and a half.

""The impact of sports at crisis moments can be powerful,'' Ackerman said. ""I do think sports wind up being a pretty powerful forum for communal grieving and the opportunity to laud first responders was unmatched. That's what I remember most about those early games -- bringing out the first responders and recognizing the military.

""As a sports fan, I remember feeling incredibly emotional with the coming together of the NYPD and the FDNY and those players treating them like the heroes they were and how humbled they seemed to feel in the presence of these really brave people. It was intense.''

Tagliabue said the days leading up to Thursday night's event ""already have stirred a lot memories.''

""I don't think anyone will ever be the same,'' he said.

That's why any talk of returning to ""normalcy'' seems trivial as it relates to 9/11.

Tagliabue recalled wondering whether anything would ever be ""normal'' again.

""The biggest question was, 'What is normal?' '' he said. ""Should you get back to normal to show your resilience? Or by going back to normal and being resilient, are you being disrespectful? It was complicated.''

Tagliabue said resuming the schedule ""was extremely emotional, because nerves were raw and there was tremendous uncertainty about whether there were going to be additional attacks, and if so would they be at stadiums?''

""I went to Kansas City, where the Giants were playing the Chiefs, and my lasting memory was the standing ovation that the Giants got from the Chiefs fans when the Giants took the field before the game,'' Tagliabue said. ""It was incredible. I don't think it's ever happened at Arrowhead Stadium in 50 years.''

Asked if we've even gotten back to normal since, Tagliabue said, ""I don't think so. Not with the lingering conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the extension of the conflict into Syria and other parts of the world and the divisiveness of our politics at the moment. Nothing's been the same since.''",687,New York Post,9/11 museum remembers sports' contributions to healing
"Oren Cass's productive pluralism is a necessary first step towards restoring the dignity of work and family life.

The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America, Oren Cass, Encounter Books, 238 pages

Earlier this year, Fox News host Tucker Carlson sparked a spirited intra-conservative debate about the Right's fidelity to free market capitalism, the perils of a consumer culture, and the opportunities and limits of public policy.

Over the course of a 15-minute, widely circulated monologue, the primetime firebrand harnessed the spirit of our political moment. Sounding equal parts Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, he lamented the plight of the working and middle classes, questioned whether cheaper consumer goods are an accurate barometer of prosperity, claimed that anybody who equivocates the health of a nation with its GDP is ""an idiot,"" and scorned what he considers to be a self-serving ruling class with no loyalty to the people it governs.

""We do not exist to serve markets,"" Carlson declared indignantly. ""Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.""

Although Carlson's monologue took some liberal observers by surprise, it fits quite comfortably in an oft-neglected strand of conservative thought -- ranging from traditionalist Russell Kirk, first-generation neoconservatives Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell, and paleoconservative Pat Buchanan -- that has long chafed at the civic and social consequences of a consumer-driven political economy.

Carlson's monologue also serves as the latest evidence of the ever-growing discontent that has animated both the Left and the Right since the 2008 global financial crisis. Unable or unwilling to adapt to the frustrations of left-behind Americans, the nation's institutions face a crisis of legitimacy. The political fortunes of center-left and center-right politicians have diminished, and so-called populists are at the barricades.

Yet while tapping into popular dissatisfaction has proven useful in galvanizing the electorate, it does not guarantee that an effective program will replace the status quo. Polemics, though oftentimes necessary precursors for political change, are no substitute for a coherent governing agenda. If our political moment is to yield a productive populist program, it will require more than fire and brimstone alone.

‚ô¶‚ô¶‚ô¶

For those who believe that the country's current trajectory is untenable, but balk at the alternative of ascendant democratic socialism, critical rethinking of our approach to public policy is necessary. Oren Cass's The Once and Future Worker, published in November by Encounter Books, is already proving an essential text for such a project.

A senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an economic advisor to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney -- a politician on the receiving end of much of Carlson's contempt -- Cass is no radical. He is, however, a heretic, willing to question the public policy orthodoxy that has dominated both parties for the past four decades.

In Cass's telling, this orthodoxy consists of a tunnel-vision focus on two economic outcomes: increasing consumption (as measured by consumer purchasing power) and expanding growth (as measured by gross domestic product). And by these two metrics, such a strategy has been an undeniable success: GDP tripled between 1975 and 2015, and the average American enjoys unprecedented access to cheaper and cheaper consumer goods.

Yet this approach, which Cass cleverly dubs ""economic piety,"" has not been without consequences. An unquestioned allegiance to growth and consumption has blinded policymakers to all other considerations, most importantly the health of the nation's labor market.

Contra free marketers, Cass dispels with the notion that the best labor market is the least-intervened-in labor market. Rather than a naturally occurring state of nature, the labor market must be understood as a garden -- it should be tended to, and not trampled upon.

Work, in Cass's narrative, is important, and the reader quickly concludes that he considers man's productive capacities to be an anthropological good. The deskilling of the American workforce and the decline in male workforce participation have therefore contributed to a host of downstream consequences for families, communities, and the nation at large. These include, but are not limited to, the multifaceted drug epidemic, lower marriage and birth rates, and a corrosive politics of resentment.

As an alternative to ""economic piety,"" Cass proposes a framework of ""productive pluralism."" Undergirding this vision is what he calls ""the working hypothesis,"" the principle that a ""labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long-term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy.""

To achieve this end, Cass proposes policies that range from orthodox to heterodox to innovative. For a book with an implicit theme of ""tradeoffs,"" The Once and Future Worker unsurprisingly contains much to like and much to hate, irrespective of the reader's political priors and preferred policy prescriptions.

In an era of Green New Deal fervor, Cass recycles long-standing conservative appeals to cut the environmental regulations that have disproportionately handicapped the productive sectors. Striking a Trumpian chord, he advocates for restricting the flow of low-skilled immigration, not for ""racist"" reasons, but because an influx of low-skilled labor has been a contributing factor to the wage stagnation of America's working class.

Although Cass believes that the Trump administration's trade regime has been ham-fisted, he does take aim at the United States' incoherent -- if not non-existent -- industrial strategy, and highlights how China's mercantilist practices and intellectual property theft have depleted America's manufacturing capacity since it was extended permanent trade relations in 2000.

Most provocatively, Cass challenges the accepted belief that the path to prosperity ought be paved with four-year college diplomas. He notes that the current one-size-fits-all approach to higher education has saddled students and graduates with a collective $1.5 trillion of debt and has actively undermined their ability to live stable and productive lives. He suggests that we return to a system of educational and vocational tracking -- to determine which students are best suited for higher education and which are best suited for the trades -- and foster a labor market in which Americans with only high school degrees can prosper as well.

Perhaps most innovatively, Cass proposes the introduction of a wage subsidy to boost the take-home pay of low-income earners. To these one might add Senator Marco Rubio's proposal to tax capital gains at a higher rate than labor, and an ambitious plan to expand the earned income tax credit put forth by Ohio senator and presumptive 2020 presidential candidate Sherrod Brown.

Readers inclined to a more hands-off approach to public policy will no doubt view Cass as well-intentioned but mistaken. Others will view him as little more than a technocratic tinkerer. The current state of affairs, in their estimation, requires a far more radical transformation of the structure of our political economy than Cass charts out. This may well be true. But Cass's effort to reframe our approach to public policy with a more holistic conception of the American citizen -- one that seeks to put the fundamental dignity of working and family life first -- is a necessary first step.

As the fallout from four decades of labor market neglect continues to realign America's political landscape, The Once and Future Worker must serve as a foundational text for those interested in harnessing the nation's collective angst into a populist program with a brain.",688,The American Conservative,Up From Consumerism
"Lights, camera, Cohen. Democrats got the reality show they wanted out of President Trump's fixer-turned-enemy, with their star witness parroting the party's talking points.

Racist, liar, con man, cheat and a threat to democracy -- Michael Cohen accused Trump of all that and more as he came to bury the man he ferociously defended for a decade. Turncoats don't turn any more dramatically than this, and never on a bigger stage.

There was also a turn-back-the-clock quality to the spectacle. Sitting over Cohen's right shoulder was Lanny Davis, Hillary Clinton's longtime pal and now a Cohen lawyer.

Don't tell Davis and Clinton that she lost the 2016 election. They think it's not over yet.

Underneath the theatrics, that was the fantasy fueling Wednesday's hearing, which was allegedly arranged by Davis. He aimed for Cohen to demolish Trump's legitimacy and set the stage for impeachment hearings before the next election.

He'll have to do much better than Wednesday to remove a sitting president. Dems are still playing exclusively to Trump haters, a significant force in America but not yet a decisive one.

More to the political point, adding a plan to endlessly torment Trump to a platform of higher taxes, open borders and free stuff doesn't sound like a formula that will win over the blue-collar workers and middle-class voters who elected him. Congress has a 20 percent approval rating, and there's no reason to think Wednesday helped.

Meanwhile, the president was in Vietnam, trying to prevent nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. Some in the GOP protested the timing of the hearing, saying it put politics on the front burner and national security on the back.

They are correct -- but the juxtaposition works to Trump's advantage. The contrast of him doing important work for peace while Dems were stuck in pure partisanship is striking.

Still, the Cohen show must be measured on its own terms, so the question deserves an answer -- did the hearing work at all? Did the convicted felon and disbarred lawyer help Dems make their case against Trump?

Yes, most obviously in his continuing smearing of the president's character and integrity. While the hush-money payments are well-documented, Cohen's repetition of the sordid saga and his allegation that Trump was directly involved guarantees that the issue will not go away.

In fact, his testimony bolstered the belief that the real threat to Trump isn't special counsel Robert Mueller. It's the separate probe by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who took over the Cohen case, as well as any Trump matters growing out of it.

For example, Cohen repeated the claim prosecutors insisted he make in his own guilty plea that Trump directed a ""criminal scheme to violate campaign-finance laws,"" which included disguised reimbursements.

Cohen also said he was aware of other Trump illegalities that he could not discuss because they are still under investigation in Manhattan.

It's a guessing game what those are, but most likely, they are related to financial issues surrounding Trump's many businesses and now-defunct foundation. Various Dems asked Cohen who else they should call to testify on those matters, and he was happy to name names, meaning we can probably expect a drumbeat of similar hearings.

Yet it's equally true that Cohen inadvertently helped Trump combat some of the most persistent and serious allegations against him regarding Russia and the 2016 campaign.

By repeating earlier denials that he never visited Prague, Cohen further discredited one of the key claims of the infamous Russian dossier -- that he had been there and met with Russian agents.

Cohen also denied that Trump had directed him to lie to Congress in 2017. This was important because if Trump had ordered Cohen to lie, it could have been a serious article of impeachment.

Most important, Cohen said he was not aware of any collusion between the president and Russia, although when pushed by one Dem, he agreed that Trump's ""desire to win would have made him work with anyone.""

He also debunked a series of hothouse rumors that the left has long wanted to inject into the political bloodstream. One had a Trump love child, another held that there was a tape of Trump hitting his wife, Melania, in an elevator.

Neither story was true, Cohen said, a clear disappointment to Dems and a rare relief to Republicans. They had insisted all day that Cohen couldn't be believed, but they were happy to take his word on those issues.

On other topics, Cohen gave answers that didn't clearly cut one way or another. He said he believed Trump knew in advance about the 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Clinton, although he had no proof.

He also said Trump knew in advance about a WikiLeaks plan to release more of Clinton's hacked e-mails in July of 2016, although Republicans insisted the plan had been reported in a British newspaper a month earlier.

Cohen is scheduled to give private testimony to another House panel Thursday, and in May, he'll begin serving a three-year sentence in federal prison. Unfortunately, we haven't heard the last of him.

He said publishers and movie makers already have contacted him, thus confirming once again that dumping on Trump is big business in America. Even a convicted liar and tax cheat can strike it rich.",689,New York Post,Michael Cohen gave Democrats the performance they wanted
"Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen testifies before Congress; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' all-star panel.

By calling on convicted liar and tax evader Michael Cohen to spend all day Wednesday telling more lies about President Trump at a hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Democrats hit a disgraceful new low in their taxpayer-funded partisan attacks on the president.

These are hysterical times in the Washington swamp. At times like this it's important to take a clear-eyed look at what is actually happening. In truth, what's happening is a national embarrassment caused by Democrats more interested in hurting our president than in serving the American people.

The witch hunt conducted by the Oversight and Reform Committee at its hearing Wednesday was yet another demonstration that Democrats are suffering from a serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.

AFTER DAY OF TESTIMONY, JORDAN CALLS COHEN 'DELUSIONAL'

These partisan Democrats are letting their intense hatred of the man the American people chose to be our president drive them to extraordinary lengths to wage political warfare against President Trump morning, noon and night.

Democrats are ignoring important legislative work because they put a far higher priority on trying to hurt the president than they do on working constructively with him for the good of the American people.

The sad truth is that the Democrats hate our president more than they love our country.

Cohen simply told the Trump-hating Democrats on the committee what they wanted to hear. But his claims that President Trump is a racist, a con man and a cheat are despicable lies - and Cohen knows it.

Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton must be smiling. Her good friend Lanny Davis is representing Cohen, president Trump's former personal attorney.

Democrats have an unmistakable credibility problem because they've already reached their conclusion about what needs to happen to President Trump: impeachment.

Davis' prominent appearance on camera sitting behind Cohen at Wednesday's hearing tells us all we need to know. The hearing was an orchestrated political hit job being acted out in plain sight. The American people are too smart to be fooled by it.

Are we supposed to ignore that The Washington Post has described Lanny Davis as ""the ultimate Clinton loyalist?""

Democrats are not interested in finding out the truth about President Trump. Their investigation of him is about political payback, Clinton style.

While the president of the United States is in Vietnam at a summit negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea, pathetic Democrats are attempting to undermine him in every way possible on the world stage.

There was a time not so long ago in our country that holding a politicized hearing such as this while the president is overseas would have been unthinkable. But today the old slogan that ""politics stops at the water's edge"" has become a meaningless relic of the past.

The Democrats are obsessed with finding wrongdoing by the president where none exists, determined to do everything in their power to obstruct his initiatives and weaken him as he works to Make America Great Again.

The hearing held Wednesday was part of an investigation of the president being led by resistance leader Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. The investigation is a complete fraud.

What credible investigation would start by receiving testimony from a convicted liar? If the Democratic majority that rules the House cared about the truth, Michael Cohen would not be their star witness.

But Cummings is doing exactly what the left's biggest donors want him to do. He's trying to impeach a duly elected president of the United States at any cost, even though there is absolutely no factual basis for impeachment.

Cummings said that his committee will not tolerate lying. I submit that the very act of inviting a convicted liar to testify is just that.

After almost two years of investigations, the most important takeaway from Wednesday's hearing is that Michael Cohen - someone who worked for Donald Trump for 10 years - knows of no collusion between Trump and Russia to affect the outcome of the 2016 president election.

But the anti-Trump media are ignoring this critically important fact. So desperate committee Democrats were forced to spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on old news involving a highly disputed campaign finance violation.

Cohen is set to go to prison in May for three years and it's clear that he's saying everything and anything he can think of in order to get his sentence reduced.

Make no mistake. Michael Cohen has only decided to tell his latest tall tales because he got caught being a criminal. His attempt to portray himself as a truth-telling virtuous man is absurd.

During the Clinton administration I was the chief investigator for the same House committee where Cohen testified Wednesday. I know that oversight can only be effective if it's seen as a legitimate fact-finding exercise by the American people.

But this Democratic majority in the U.S. House is not interested in fact-finding. Democrats have an unmistakable credibility problem because they've already reached their conclusion about what needs to happen to President Trump: impeachment.

In the final analysis, Wednesday's hearing was a waste of time and taxpayer funds because it simply rehashed stories that have been bandied about in the liberal media for months and sometimes even years.

It's a shame that Democrats think that juvenile and outlandish questions about irrelevant topics are more important than finding solutions on border security and health care.

On the roster: Are the early states still special? - I'll Tell You What: Biden his time - Beto keeps options open, rules out Senate run - Senate GOP chilly to Pence pitch for Trump emergency - Crabby and hangry

ARE THE EARLY STATES STILL SPECIAL?

The best argument for America's odd presidential primary election system is that it forces candidates to interact with voters in a handful of states and pass the test under intense scrutiny.

This advantage is tied to the other good argument for our four February contests: By starting small and then scaling up into Super Tuesday in March, dark horse or insurgent candidates have a chance to compete without the need for prohibitively large advertising and staff budgets.

Part of this thinking is also about diversity. Iowa caucus goers are looking for one thing, New Hampshire voters are looking for another while South Carolinians and Nevadans want different things still. The interests, demographics and hyper-local issues don't allow candidates to retreat into gauzy platitudes the way they do in general elections or multi-state primary days.

There's something wholesome about forcing those who seek the most powerful office in the world to contend with ranch-loving Iowa college students, sleepy New Hampshireites, crusty kingmakers in South Carolina and union bosses in Nevada.

We acknowledge, though, that there's another side to the argument. After all, why should voters in the states that rank 31st, 41st, 23rd and 32nd respectively in population have so much say over what the rest of the country is doing? Why do those states deserve extra attention and favors - looking at you, ethanol subsidies - compared to the others? Wouldn't it be more fair to let everyone vote at once?

But we still think that while it sounds more fair to let voters all jump in the pool at once, it's still better to let the campaigns evolve over time, even if it means giving outsized influence to the peculiar considerations of voters in four small-to-medium-sized states.

But is that what's still happening?

We've watched over the past decade as local politics is increasingly washed away by a loud, angry, vapid nationalized version. The old axiom of former House Speaker Tip O'Neill that ""all politics is local"" no longer applies.

In the era of social media, weak local news outlets and strong national narratives, local issues and personalities often end up getting steamrolled. It's not unreasonable to think that's what's happening in the February primary states as well.

Neither party's 2016 nominees did the kind of state-specific campaigning their predecessors had done. Both were super-famous national figures and both relied on essentially the same message throughout. The Democrat ran mostly on gender and the Republican mostly ran on the pitch that he could reverse national decline. But they didn't hang out in many Iowa coffee shops or New Hampshire living rooms. They didn't sit through dozens of town halls as picky voters looked them over.

It's still far too early to say whether this time around will be different. There's no prohibitive frontrunner on the Democratic side and, other than a former vice president and the 2016 runner up, no candidates with the universal name identification that would allow for the same high-altitude bombing approach.

But there's also no guarantee that the early states will revert to form and fulfill their special role in our system of taking the full measure of the candidates before they become celebrities.

On a fundamental business level, there was growing disillusion within the record industry by early 1980 regarding disco's profit potential. As popular as the music was on the radio and in the clubs, disco had failed to produce many of the kind of dependable, multi-platinum acts that the industry depended on for its biggest profits. It was also hard to ignore the obvious signs of the backlash in the popular culture of the time. ... At a Chicago White Sox game the previous July, tens of thousands of marauding disco-haters forced the cancellation and forfeit of a game at Comiskey Park on 'Disco Sucks' promotion night. And then there was Ethel Merman's disco version of 'There's No Business Like Show Business,' a sure sign of the coming apocalypse that the Academy chose to ignore.""

BETO KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN, RULES OUT SENATE RUN

Dallas Morning News: ""Beto O'Rourke has decided not to run for Senate next year against Republican incumbent John Cornyn and likely will announce a campaign for president soon, people close to the former El Paso congressman told The Dallas Morning News Wednesday. Numerous people close to O'Rourke said they expect him to announce his presidential campaign within weeks. For his own part, O'Rourke on Wednesday wouldn't reveal his future political plans except to say he has made up his mind. 'Amy and I have made a decision about how we can best serve our country,' he said in an exclusive statement to The Dallas Morning News. 'We are excited to share it with everyone soon.' ... Should he join the presidential race, O'Rourke would join a large Democratic Party primary field. He's behind much of the field in fundraising, developing an organization and getting in front of voters.""

Harris tries to captivate California donors - Politico: ""Donor-rich California has long been known as the ATM of the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris wants to turn it into her personal armored truck. The California senator and 2020 presidential candidate has nursed connections with the state's biggest donors during three campaigns for statewide office and two more for district attorney in San Francisco. Now, Harris is working aggressively to turn those connections into commitments securing those donors before out-of-state presidential rivals have a chance. Before the presidential race even started, Harris spent hundreds of thousands of dollars through her leadership PAC to prospect the California donor scene. She has already held more California fundraisers than any other candidate for president, seeking out the bundlers who raised massive sums for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.""

Early state Dem leaders want non-aggression pact - Politico: ""Democratic Party chairs in the four early presidential states are working to convince the 2020 presidential candidates to avoid waging social media disinformation warfare against each other. The effort began this week with a letter to state party chairs across the country broadly laying out the issue with an ultimate goal of establishing what amounts to a non-aggression pact... 'We would like your support in recommending the ASDC [Association of State Democratic Committees] work towards developing a collaborative approach to battling disinformation, illicit campaign tactics, bots, trollfarms, fake accounts, altered text, audio, and video, any and all inauthentic speech in our Presidential Primary process,' wrote the four chairs, including New Hampshire's Ray Buckley, Iowa's Troy Price, South Carolina's Trav Robertson and Nevada's William McCurdy.""

SENATE GOP CHILLY TO PENCE PITCH FOR TRUMP EMERGENCY

Politico: ""Vice President Mike Pence faced a wall of resistance from Senate Republicans on Tuesday as he tried to sell President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration on the southern border, according to multiple GOP sources. The pointed reception at the GOP lunch raised further doubts among Senate Republicans that the administration will be able to hold down defections on a crucial vote to block the president in the coming weeks. ... Pence told Republicans that Trump's plan to unilaterally shift billions in military funding to border wall construction was not like President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, according to four attendees. He argued Trump is using an existing law and money approved by Congress, unlike Obama's efforts to shield some immigrants from deportation.""

NORTHAM'S WIFE GAVE BLACK STUDENTS COTTON

WaPo: ""A Virginia state employee has complained that her eighth-grade daughter was upset during a tour of the historic governor's residence when first lady Pam Northam handed raw cotton to her and another African American child and asked them to imagine being enslaved and having to pick the crop. 'The Governor and Mrs. Northam have asked the residents of the Commonwealth to forgive them for their racially insensitive past actions,' Leah Dozier Walker, who oversees the Office of Equity and Community Engagement at the state Education Department, wrote Feb. 25 to lawmakers and the office of Gov. Ralph Northam (D). ... Northam's office and one other parent of a child who was present said the first lady did not single out the African American students and simply handed out the cotton to a group. But the incident highlights the scrutiny and doubt that envelop the governor as he tries to push past racist incidents from his past and ignore continued calls for his resignation.""

COHEN LOBS BOMBS AT TRUMP DURING FIERY HEARING

Fox News: ""Michael Cohen, the former fixer about to begin a three-year prison term, completed his renunciation of President Trump during an explosive congressional hearing Wednesday that left no room for reconciliation - calling his former boss a racist, testifying he was aware of an adviser's talks with WikiLeaks about stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign and alleging he oversaw an array of illicit schemes during the 10 years they worked together. 'He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat,' Cohen testified, setting the tone for the hearing. ... Yet Cohen stopped short of saying he had evidence that Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia in 2016, asserting he had only 'suspicions.' And Republicans on the House Oversight Committee repeatedly struck at Cohen's credibility, pointing out that he is a convicted liar and suggesting he only turned on Trump after not landing a White House job.""

Florida congressman may face consequences for nasty tweet - CBS News: ""Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, is facing some potentially serious fallout after he tweeted a message many perceived as threatening Michael Cohen, prior to Cohen's public testimony this afternoon before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Gaetz, an attorney, is now being investigated by the Florida Bar for a potential violation the organization's conduct rules, and Rep. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) suggested that he should be referred for possible criminal prosecution for 'witness intimidation or tampering.' ... The account has since deleted the tweet, and Gaetz apologized after being chastised by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. 'It was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I'm deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I'm sorry,' he wrote.""

FROM THE BLEACHERS

""You said in reply to a correspondent questioning the new use of the word 'woke' that, 'The key, Ms. Peterson, is that in this sense it's a noun rather than the traditional sense of 'I woke the dog when I got up early for work,' where it is a verb.' You then use the example 'Don't judge so-and-so because he used offensive terms in the past because he is now 'woke' and acting in a socially conscious way.' You don't mean 'noun,' you mean 'adjective.' I know our two countries are said to be divided by a common language, but I trust we are still united by a common grammar."" - Dr. Evan Harris, London, U.K.

[Ed. note: Quite so, Dr. Harris! 'Woke' in that case would certainly be a descriptive word. Good catch!]

""Did I read that right, at the bottom of your February 22nd report, that, '(Republicans, when) Asked if the Mueller report would make them reconsider their vote for Trump, just 22 percent said it would affect their support for Trump if the report concludes that Trump conspired with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.' Please tell me I read that wrong. I can see the average Republican reserving judgment 'til all the facts are known, but I was hoping that conspiring with an foreign adversary to undermine our election would cause about 98% of Republicans to withdraw support for the man.

"Conservative attacked on UC Berkeley campus gives update on case

The Washington Post finally got around to covering a recent attack on a conservative activist at the University of California at Berkeley on Wednesday - but put an emphasis on the fact that conservatives were upset about the situation.

It has become common practice for mainstream media organizations to focus on the ""Republicans pounce"" aspect of any story that would appear unfavorable to the left. In this case, the Post's story was headlined: ""A conservative activist was punched in the face at UC Berkeley. The response enraged the right."" It cited a Fox News report published Tuesday, one of several which has been published since the incident occurred last week.

CONSERVATIVES CALL OUT UC POLICE FOR LACK OF ARREST ONE WEEK AFTER BERKELEY CAMPUS ASSAULT ON ACTIVIST

The incident, which was captured on a cell phone, occurred as the activist, Hayden Williams, was manning a recruiting table for Turning Point USA, a conservative organization. Williams, who is not a student, told Fox News last week that he filed a police report immediately after the incident.

Alex Szarka, a Berkeley junior, told Fox News he was walking on campus last week when he saw the altercation and decided to videotape it. The attack quickly went viral in conservative circles but was largely overlooked by the mainstream media.

A search of Williams' name and the word ""Berkeley"" on the Post's website doesn't show any mention of the attack prior to Wednesday's piece about the right being ""enraged.""

ACTIVIST ASSAULTED AT BERKELEY SAYS CAMPUSES EMBEDDED WITH CULTURE OF HOSTILITY TO CONSERVATIVES

Post reporter Katie Mettler wrote that UC Berkeley officials were gearing up to apprehend the suspect but pivoted to the response of conservatives by the third paragraph.

""The news comes after a seven-day campaign by conservative activists both at Berkeley and nationally, who have argued, on social media, right-leaning political websites and Fox News, that because of liberal bias, the attack garnered what they perceive as a delayed response from the police and university and a muted response from the public,"" Mettler wrote.

Mettler cited a Donald Trump Jr. tweet in which the president's oldest son pondered, ""Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley Campus?""

The Post then put an emphasis on the university denying that it acted with a liberal bias before detailing the attack itself.

Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor is among the critics of the newspaper's coverage.

""This is incredible,"" Gainor told Fox News. ""The left-wing Washington Post ignores a hate crime against a young conservative for eight days. Then when it finally chimes in, it's with the latest version of conservatives pounce. ""Instead of reporting the news, the Post notes how conservatives are upset and that, 'The response enraged the right.'""

MSNBC'S AVOIDANCE OF JUSSIE SMOLLETT STORY DURING PRIMETIME 'A POLITICALLY BIASED JOURNALISTIC CHOICE,' EXPERT SAYS

Gainor added: ""How dare right-wingers be upset that someone got attacked on a college campus because of his politics and the major media all-but ignored it? Especially after turning repeated hate hoaxes into national news stories - like Jussie Smollett. It's also worth noting that the Post is being sued for $250 million for how awfully it covered the Covington hoax"".

The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

he framing of the story was quickly ridiculed on social media:

Meanwhile, Williams told Fox News on Friday that he's been attacked before while helping recruit on college campuses, including two weeks ago at U.C.L.A., but never to the degree he was at Berkeley.

"MADRID - Former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has made a strident defense of Spain's national unity as a witness at the trial of a dozen Catalan separatists.

Rajoy told Spain's Supreme Court on Wednesday that he had warned Catalonia's separatist leaders on several occasions leading up to their failed 2017 secession attempt that ""the law, the national sovereignty and the Constitution are non-negotiable.""

The ex-leader of Spain's conservatives was unable to stop the separatists from holding an unauthorized referendum and a subsequent declaration of independence in Oct. 2017. In response to the resulting institutional crisis, Rajoy fired the Catalan government and ordered a temporary takeover of the region by central authorities.

"Stephen Wertheim describes the rival camps that are fighting over the future of U.S. foreign policy:

Foreign policy hands are putting forward something like opposite diagnoses of America's failure and opposite prescriptions for the future. One camp holds that the United States erred by coddling China and Russia, and urges a new competition against these great power rivals. The other camp, which says the United States has been too belligerent and ambitious around the world, counsels restraint, not another crusade against grand enemies.

Wertheim's essay provides a valuable overview of the current debates over the proper U.S. role in the world. Advocates of restraint will benefit from reading the entire piece. It is fair to say that ""advocates of restraint tend to become less vocal and unified when they turn beyond the Middle East,"" but I submit that we have been so focused on U.S. policies in the Middle East because they have been among the worst, most destructive, and costliest of our policies overseas. He is also right that advocates of restraint ""would benefit from taking a similarly global view if it is to advance a comprehensive alternative to the status quo."" However, as Wertheim understands, the core appeal of a strategy of restraint is that the U.S. will necessarily refrain from doing as much in as many places as it has done under the current strategy of primacy, so in many instances restraint doesn't propose an alternative so much as it promises a halt to unwanted and unnecessary activity.

Great power competition will always be with us to one degree or another. It is as close to a permanent feature of international politics as one is likely to find. What distinguishes the competition camp that Wertheim identifies is a belief that the U.S. needs to confront both major authoritarian powers at the same time. The revival of Cold War rhetoric and framing is a major part of this. This not simply an acknowledgment of competition with Russia and China, but an argument for seeing relations with both of them as zero-sum rivalries. Insofar as this camp has a coherent strategy, it amounts to driving two of the world's major nuclear-armed powers closer together in common cause against the U.S. as our government tries to pressure and ""contain"" both. The costs and risks of this strategy will inevitably be much greater, and if the U.S. pursues it consistently the potential for great power conflict increases dramatically.

It's no secret that I think a strategy of restraint is the obviously preferable choice. If the practical alternative is pursuing something like another Cold War with all of its attendant dangers against a wealthier and more powerful rival, I have to think that most Americans will see the advantages in restraint as well.",697,The American Conservative,Foreign Policy Restraint or a New Cold War?
"CNN's town hall event with 2020 presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders reportedly featured questions from Democratic operatives.

CNN has been accused of failing to disclose Democratic Party ties of several attendees who were able to ask 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders questions during the network's town hall on Monday.

The CNN event followed other recent town halls featuring Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; and potential independent candidate, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. But unlike those town halls, many participants who posed policy questions to Sanders appear to have political ties, which was first reported by Paste Magazine.

FOX NEWS DOMINATES MSNBC, CNN ACROSS THE BOARD DURING FEBRUARY

Paste writer Jacob Weindling questioned whether CNN stacked the audience against the Democratic Socialist by not disclosing the background of some of the participants.

Paste Magazine pointed out that at least four attendees have deep roots in the Democratic Party and the D.C. lobby, and alleged the way CNN described the participants either downplayed their background or did not disclose such ties at all.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tara Ebersole, who asked about Sanders' plan for universal health care, was introduced by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer as a ""former biology professor,"" but her reported LinkedIn page claims her current job is chair of the Baltimore County Democratic Party.

LEFTIES TURN ON ANTI-TRUMP CNN AFTER NETWORK HIRES EX-JEFF SESSIONS SPOKESWOMAN SARAH ISGUR

Yunjung Seo, who was described by CNN as a ""George Washington student,"" is currently an intern for the Democratic fundraising organization, the Katz Watson Group, and was previously a campaign fellow for Hillary Clinton for America according to her reported LinkedIn page. Her question was about how Sanders plans on alleviating student debt.

However, the arguably toughest question of the night was asked by Shadi Nasab, who was referred to as an ""American University student"" but is also an intern for the left-wing group Public Policy, according to her reported LinkedIn page.

""As we saw in the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Party has become more female, more racially diverse, and younger in age. How can a voter like me feel confident in your ability to represent the party, especially given that your response to sexual harassment allegations during your campaign is that you were 'a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case to be elected as president,'"" Nasab asked.

Abena McAllister, who was described by Blitzer as ""active in Maryland Democrat Party,"" was listed by CNN's chyron as a ""mother of two."" However, she is apparently the chair of the Charles County Democratic Central Committee.

CNN ANALYST DAVID GERGEN SAYS ROGER STONE COULD BE SEEN AS A 'DANDY' IN JAIL: 'WILL HE BE SUBJECT TO RAPE?'

Paste Magazine's Weindling thought the questions were ""completely normal"" until he did a little digging.

""You cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN's role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace.""

-- Paste Magazine's Jacob Weindling

""Now that it has been revealed that the question was asked by an intern at a major lobbying firm, you cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN's role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace,"" Weindling wrote. ""If it was just this one questioner, we could chalk it up to a mistake, or an acknowledgement that CNN reasonably didn't believe that an intern needed to disclose her workplace. But this wasn't just one questioner. There were a bunch of audience members who are far more active in politics than CNN disclosed.""

Mediaite's Caleb Ecarma pointed out why some prominent Democrats might not want Sanders to come off as favorable during the CNN event.

""Sanders has been harshly criticized by leading Democrats for supposedly trying to spoil the party's primary election, given his label as an independent and perception as an outsider,"" Ecarma wrote.

The Young Turks - a progressive digital news organization - spent significant time breaking down the situation. Host Ana Kasparian said ""it appears that CNN did not disclose the true identities of the individuals asking the questions,"" calling the network's behavior ""unethical.""

""Viewers should know who these individuals are,"" Kasparian said.

Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur admitted he didn't know if the participants did not fully disclose their identity to CNN or if CNN purposely withheld information from viewers. But Uygur said there is an ""unfortunate history"" of CNN being unfair to ""one particular candidate,"" which he said is Sanders.

"Michael Cohen testifying before Congress (Fox News screengrab)

The text of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's testimony to Congress today has been released. It's a doozy. Here's the entire transcript. It's a shameful thing to consider that such a man, Trump, is president of the United States. He's a thug, but there's not even any Godfather-ly grandeur to his thuggishness. He's just a dirtbag from Queens. Here's an excerpt from the testimony. This is not the worst things Cohen accuses the president of doing, not by far, but it's the most indicative of his character, I think:

Mr. Trump is a cheat.

As previously stated, I'm giving the Committee today three years of President Trump's financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes. These are Exhibits 1a, 1b, and 1c to my testimony.

It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.

I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr. Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests. These are Exhibit 2 to my testimony.

As I noted, I'm giving the Committee today an article he wrote on, and sent me, that reported on an auction of a portrait of Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 3A to my testimony.

Mr. Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon. The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation,

which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony.

And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it.

And yet, I continued to work for him.

Let me be clear: this is by no means the worst thing Cohen accused the president of in this written testimony. For example, he says that Trump knew in advance of the WikiLeaks revelation of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.

Cohen admits that he lied to Congress, and we know that he's a tax cheat. The Republicans on the Committee are ripping into Cohen hard on his credibility, or lack thereof. It's interesting to consider that the Republicans are attacking Cohen for being a scum-sucker for the things he did during the years he was working for Trump. It is certainly true: Michael Cohen is a sleaze. He essentially admits it in testimony, says he's going to jail, and deserves to. You can say: Why should we believe him now?

Well, read his testimony. It's 100 percent believable, 100 percent consonant with what we know about Donald Trump's character. Seriously, read the testimony. Say with a straight face that that doesn't sound like the Donald we know. Seriously. Come on.

So, you are asking, how could you possibly vote for a man like Trump? The answer is: the moral and political cost of giving power to the other side is even greater. You know why I say that; I'm not going to go into it any further here. We talk about this in some form all the time. It is possible that everything Michael Cohen says today is 100 percent true, and it is still a more moral choice to vote for this immoral man, Trump, rather than for a leader of the party of infanticide, left-wing identity politics, and the rest.

But this testimony, what it reveals is some profoundly corrupt stuff. People like me, we aren't going to be able to get the stink off easily, if ever. Thing is, we knew this about him all along. Nobody can plausibly be surprised. Trump has been this guy all his life.",700,The American Conservative,Our Thug Life President
"The U.S. isn't a banana republic, but its police apparatus sometimes comes close.

The broadening revelations of the lawless, almost putschist excesses of the Comey-McCabe FBI and elements of the Justice Department and the Brennan-Clapper intelligence services invite serious contemplation of how close the United States came to being a country where regime change might be plausibly and self-righteously attempted by what in undemocratic countries is generally known as the secret police. It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a ""banana republic."" Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America's status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers. Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer-client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights' constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned. It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country's initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin's nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation's chief military requirement.

Jefferson's initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Fr√©mont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander). When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: ""Today."" No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.

The federal police (FBI) are another matter. The leader of a successful previous organization and of the FBI for a total of 47 years, J. Edgar Hoover, has been strenuously criticized for his unscrupulous political machinations, but he never attempted to influence a presidential election. When the military are depoliticized, the secret police and intelligence services, if not reined in, can be very powerful, in a democratic country as in a dictatorship. In the Soviet Union, the army only briefly was politically influential, under Marshal Zhukhov just after the death of Stalin, while Stalin's last three secret-police leaders, Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria, were all summarily executed after they had done a great deal of his unimaginable dirty work. Even in revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the greatest police minister in all history, the egregiously cunning Joseph Fouch√©, who sent the head of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, to the guillotine at the end of the Reign of Terror, after Robespierre had tried to do the same to him, was sent packing finally, rich but mistrusted and powerless.

American democracy is insuperably strong in the hearts of the people and in 230 years of triumphant survival through a vehement and contentious national history. But the recent fantastic cascade of professions of righteous untouchability from Comey and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper shows that there is no institutional tradition of respect for and deference to the constitutional integrity of the system in the main police and intelligence agencies. Though fired for dishonesty and sent for grand-jury evaluation as a criminal lying to Congress and out of control, Andrew McCabe generally enjoys the support of the Trump-hating media in his book tour, celebrating a lawless disregard for the supremacy of the people under the Constitution. He feared that Trump might be a ""Russian asset,"" and accordingly set a special counsel with practically unlimited powers, who engaged a fervently partisan Democratic staff, upon him.

Almost the entire legal system of the United States requires radical reform and democratization, and the disarming of a virtually omnipotent prosecutocracy. It is the strength and the weakness of America that it is not really the gentle and kindly country portrayed by Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney. That America exists and is a revered pastoral self-image. But the United States is ultimately a jungle, and jungles are ruled by 30-foot constricting snakes and 600-pound cats, and these are usually the rulers of America, with a varying level of humanization.

The intense struggle for the highest positions in the country is a generally meritocratic struggle, with only rare lapses into mediocrity. The survival and elevation process leaves an inordinate number of severely shattered people. In such a society, the senior police and intelligence apparatus can be dangerous, and in the last few years, it has been. The outcome of the present struggle for power in Washington should include tighter civilian control of these agencies, as in the military, the end of the effort to criminalize policy differences, and the end of the attempted reduction of the drastic remedy of impeachment to a partisan power play to reverse the result of elections. That is essentially what it was in the Nixon and Clinton presidencies and has been since the 2016 election.

"Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a new interview that the GOP is being held ""hostage"" - and that Republicans are refusing to speak up on a host of issues, including an impeachment of President Trump.

When asked by Rolling Stone if she would vote to impeach the president, the self-described Democratic socialist said: ""Yeah. No question.""

""I don't even know why it's controversial. I mean, OK, it's not that I don't know why it's controversial,"" she said. ""I understand that some people come from very tough districts where their constituents are torn. But for me and my community in the Bronx and Queens, it's easy.""

The 29-year-old continued: ""In the Republican Party, there's a hostage situation going on. There are a lot of Republicans that know what the right thing to do is -- not just on impeachment but on a wide range of issues -- and they refuse to speak up.""

She called the status quo, ""an unacceptable position, because we're not in the realm of politics anymore. These are not questions of politics. These are questions of society. These are questions of equal treatment. These are questions of civil rights.""

The socialist darling shot down the argument that some lawmakers have different intentions ""behind closed doors"" despite voting with the president.

""The problem is that if they vote the same way, what does it matter? I don't care what's in your heart if how you are voting is the same as someone who is actually racist,"" she said.

""I am tired of people saying, 'I'm gonna vote the same way as bigots, but I don't share the ideology of bigots.' Well, you share the action and the agenda of bigots. We need to hold that accountable.""

Ocasio-Cortez, a prolific user of social media, was asked about those who have compared her to Trump in that regard.

""Well, I think that there's this rush to make that comparison, but any time media fundamentally changes, the first movers to recognize that change -- and to learn it and to adapt to it -- tend to have that first-move advantage,"" she said.

""So this is less about personality, less about Trump, and more about who has had the first-mover advantage. But there are similarities. People who succeed in social media follow similar tenets. In order to resonate with people, you have to tell them what you mean, you have to be willing to make mistakes, you have to be willing to be vulnerable and learn as you go.""

In her broadside against the president, she said what he ""is trying to do in undermine truth itself.""

""Just because I'm pushing back on reporters calling women unlikable doesn't mean that I think their outlet itself is 'fake,'"" she said. ""There's a huge difference between checking a narrative and checking an actual institution. That's how you get climate deniers being treated just as seriously as venerable scientists.""

The progressive Democrat, who won a stunning victory over Rep. Joe Crowley in last year's Democratic primary, said that last time she was ""pissed"" was during Trump's ""bulls -- border address, watching this guy be racist from the Oval Office.""

""I saw it as a defilement. In terms of how we channel it, we just take that anger and that energy and use it to say, 'This is why we need the moonshot,'"" she said.

When reminded that she said on CNN that she wanted people to underestimate her because that was how she won her primary, Ocasio-Cortez said that ""people like making these disparaging statements, like, 'Oh, she's good at Twitter. Is she gonna be an actual legislator?'

""I think it's fine at the outset to be underestimated in that capacity. Where I do tell people to come correct is when they try to paint me as unintelligent, as unsubstantive. That's when you see me fire back.""",702,New York Post,Ocasio-Cortez says GOP is being held 'hostage' by Trump

""So despite all the talk about her ancestry and how confusing she has made things ... She has got very dedicated supporters.""

Harf echoed similar sentiments, while highlighting a major challenge facing all Democratic candidates.

""I think that there's a lot of energy, quite frankly, in both pieces of the Democratic Party and we're going to be fighting that out over the next months of this Primary.""

Stirewalt, though, pointed to the controversy surrounding her heritage as something that will stick in the mind of voters.

"Lori Lightfoot, left, and Toni Preckwinkle, right, will face each other in an April 2 runoff.

Two African-American women clinched the top two spots in Chicago's mayoral election Tuesday, meaning they will face each other in a runoff to become the Windy City's first black female mayor.

Lori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle beat 12 other candidates -- including William Daley, son of former Mayor Richard Daley -- but neither grabbed more than 50 percent of the vote, meaning there will be a runoff in April to succeed outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

RAHM EMANUEL WARNS DEMS NOT TO 'MIMIC' TRUMP'S POLITICS

According to The Chicago Tribune, unofficial results showed Lightfoot with 17.5 percent, Preckwinkle with 16 percent and Daley with 14.7 percent. Chicago has had a female mayor before, and an African-American mayor, but never an African-American woman as a mayor.

""What do you think of us now?"" Lightfoot told supporters Tuesday night. ""This is what change looks like.""

She later congratulated Preckwinkle for reaching the runoff: ""No matter which one of us wins, Chicago will make history on April 2nd by electing the first Black woman mayor. It's long overdue,"" she tweeted.

Lightfoot, a political outsider and the first openly gay woman to run for Chicago mayor, was the subject of an early apparent shot from Preckwinkle, a former City Council member and public school teacher, over her lack of political experience.

""It's not enough to stand at a podium and talk about what you want to see happen,"" Preckwinkle said. ""You have to come to this job with the capacity and the capability to make your vision a reality.""

According to the Tribune, Lightfoot had positioned herself as the progressive voice against an entrenched Chicago political machine, while Preckwinkle pitched herself as someone with a track record of taking on powerful interests.

""We may not yet be at the finish line, but we should acknowledge that history is being made,"" Preckwinkle said in Hyde Part, according to the Tribune. ""It's clear we're at a defining moment in our city's history, but the challenges that our city faces are not simply ideological. It's not enough to say Chicago stands at a crossroads. We need to fight to change its course.""

Turnout was low, with The Associated Press reporting that by late afternoon turnout was around 27 percent of registered voters. The prior low was 33.8 percent in 2007.

Lightfoot and Preckwinkle had both been critical of the city's response to the 2014 police shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Emanuel's popularity dropped after the release of video of McDonald's shooting, and he eventually decided not to seek re-election.

"""That's it -- Antwerp now has more non-natives than natives,"" claimed a headline in French-language news weekly, L'Express, over new figures which revealed that 53.2 per cent of residents in the city -- Belgium's most populous -- are now of immigrant origin.

According to the latest demographic report from City Monitor, as well as to data compiled by sociologist Jan Hertogen earlier this month, North African immigrants -- who in Belgium hail mostly from Morocco -- and migrants from West Asia, who are mostly Turkish, comprise the biggest proportion of Antwerp residents with a foreign background.

With the proportion of non-Belgians in the city having grown from 46 per cent in 2014, L'Express notes that the major demographic shift ""obviously has consequences"" for politics in Antwerp, which has been led since 2013 by Mayor Bart De Wever, who heads the conservative New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party.

To illustrate this, the magazine pointed to a University of Antwerp study which found that almost 90 per cent of the city's voters with Moroccan or Turkish origins voted at last October's elections for left-wing parties, with 31 per cent opting for the extreme left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA).

Meanwhile ""the N-VA attracted only a remarkably low proportion of votes"" from people in this demographic, said L'Express, commenting that numbers showing the fast-changing electoral landscape ""should not really surprise"", when 10 per cent of what it called ""old Belgians"" who voted in 2012 had been replaced by voters ""of immigrant origin"" by the time of last year's polls.

""It is only voters aged 40 to 50 and above who are voting for the right [N-VA] and far-right [populist Flemish Interest (VB)] in Antwerp,"" said Hertogen, asserting that the figures ""illustrate painfully how De Wever appeals explicitly to remnants of the far-right, and the historic frustration of old Belgians"".

""De Wever is mayor of a city now already lost"" to conservative politics, with demographic change making a future N-VA victory almost unthinkable, he remarked, pointing to figures which showed that -- already in 2015 -- 72 per cent of the city's children aged six and under had a migrant background.

""The future of a place in the decades to come can be read from the composition of children from 0 to 6 years and the evolution of this demographic in recent years,"" Hertogen said, adding that ""Berber as a language [will be spoken] alongside Dutch Arabic, Moroccan Arabic and for some children 'standard' Arabic, alongside French, English, German, etc.""

Last year, the sociologist complained there was ""actual apartheid"" in Belgium because non-EU nationals who have lived in the country for less than five years, were not permitted to vote in elections.

""The solution is obvious,"" wrote Hertogen in an op-ed for Flemish news magazine Knack, in which he argued that all foreigners resident in Belgium should be automatically registered and required by law to vote, in order ""to ensure democracy"" at a time when ""the phantom of mass immigration is frequently raised in populists' discourse"".

""This decision would require political courage, and looks ahead to what will, necessarily, be an increasingly diverse society,"" he admitted, but stressed it was ""precisely now"" that the country must introduce compulsory voting for foreigners ""so that the groups who are being attacked can defend themselves politically"".

With the demographic change, Antwerp joins a small handful of other cities where minority groups outnumber the national majority. British capital London has been minority majority at least since the time of the 2011 census, where a combination of mass migration and white flight saw the city hit the tipping-point faster than expected.

Britain's second city, Birmingham, is expected to be majority minority as well by the time of the 2021 census, with almost a quarter of the city already born abroad and white pupils accounting for less than a third of school children.",706,Breitbart,Historic European City Antwerp Now Majority-Minority

Alex J. Pollock writes about how banking has changed -- and hasn't changed -- in 50 years. There are fewer banks and many more failures today than in the 1950s, but one thing hasn't changed: ""the tight connection between banking and the government. As banking scholar Charles Calomiris has convincingly summed it up, all banking systems are a deal between the politicians and the bankers.""

Is it time for an Agrarian Option? Mary Cuff makes the case: ""For Warren, looking back on what had united the various beasts in that tent, the dominant concern had been 'the disintegration of the notion of the individual in that society we're living in‚ÄÖ.‚ÄÖ.‚ÄÖ.‚ÄÖand the relation of that to democracy. It's the machine of power in this so-called democratic state; the machines disintegrate individuals, so you have no individual sense of responsibility and no awareness that the individual has a past and a place. He's simply the voting machine; he's everything you pull the lever on if there's any voting at all.' He proposed that the agrarian program had been 'trying to find a notion of democracy' that saved individuals and society from such a fate. Warren's reaffirmation of agrarianism in these terms can be a valuable model for conservatives today who approve of the agrarian diagnosis yet remain unconvinced by recent popular and popularizing versions of its solutions.""

Love in the abstract: Barton Swaim reviews Daniel J. Mahoney's The Idol of Our Age: How the Religion of Humanity Subverts Christianity: ""Humanitarianism in this sense holds that the Christian's highest and, perhaps, only duty is to exhibit compassion and fellow-feeling toward humanity as a whole. The humanitarian's chief concern is with humanity in the abstract, the supposed plight of faraway peoples of whom the humanitarian likely has little or no direct knowledge. Humanitarianism looks with suspicion on any attitude or religion that treats one's own family, church, neighborhood, city, or country with special affection . . . That may sound like a merely stupid failing -- an obsession, say, with injustices done to illegal immigrants thousands of miles away but hatred for one's neighbor who takes a different view -- but Mahoney contends that religious humanitarianism is much worse than that. As the citizen's love and loyalty attach less and less to those nearest to him and more and more to an abstract and idealized agglomeration of 'humanity,' social bonds loosen and politics itself becomes meaningless.""

Deborah Warren writes about the poetry of William Baer: ""Robert Frost said, 'Poetry is what gets lost in translation.' More than on an idea or a story line, poetry depends on idiom and nuance.

""A picture that comprises figure and ground requires an enclosed field. Without an enclosure, the space around its figure(s) will not necessarily read as part of the picture; enclosure is, therefore, the originary act that gives rise to the picture but also limits it. Nothing says this enclosure needs to take the shape of a rectangle, but the history of Western art, at least, makes the rectangle look like a virtually inescapable anatomical limit.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is getting involved in the state's campaign finance laws, calling for to limit the influence of big donors.

""These changes to our election system are really important. In my campaign, I didn't accept a single dollar from corporations. The average donation in my campaign was $15,"" Ocasio-Cortez said a video released by the advocacy group Make the Road New York.

""That's really important because it changes the issues, it changes the advocacy, that we have in Congress. And that would have the same effects here in New York.""

She then slammed New York's law as more lax than the federal law when it comes to campaign donations.

""Here in New York, someone who wants to run for State Senate or State Assembly can accept more corporate donations than a member of Congress at the federal level,"" said the congresswoman.

Election reformers are pushing for a public finance system that allows candidates to collect six dollars in public matching funds for every small donation they receive, similar to New York City's program.

As it happens, Gov. Cuomo announced proposals this year to lower campaign contribution limits and enact the 6-to-1 public matching program.

For statewide races, candidates would be able to collect no more than $25,000 combined from a donor for a primary general election campaigns, down from $65,100.

For Senate races, donors would be allowed to give no more than $10,000 down from $18,000.

For Assembly races, contributions limits would drop from $8,800 to $6,000 combined for primary and general elections.

The Legislature, controlled by Democrats is likely to pass stricter contribution limits. The Assembly and Senate already approved a law last month to limit contributions from real estate moguls through a network of limited liability corporations.

"In the 1980s Bernie Sanders cozied up to dictators from around the world.

In his decades-long career in politics, Bernie Sanders was never more active as a foreign-policy figure than when he was the mayor of Burlington, Vt. He owned it. ""Burlington had a foreign policy,"" he wrote in his 1997 book, Outsider in the White House. From his mayoral perch he fired off missives to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, demanding better treatment of IRA prisoners held in Northern Ireland. He tried to establish direct relations with the incoming Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, hoping to establish a radio channel that would broadcast the revolution to Vermont. The mayor met with Daniel Ortega to convey that many Americans rejected the Reagan administration's foreign policy. Ortega, in the many years since, has looted his country, installed hideous light fixtures along the major roads to please his wife, suborned much of the Catholic Church to his rule, and blown past his own constitution's term limits. The country is sliding into unrest, as the aid that used to come in from the Netherlands and Luxembourg has dried up.

As mayor, Sanders cemented a sister-city relationship between Burlington and the Russian city of Yaroslavl (he and his wife spent their honeymoon in the Soviet Union). Sanders was diplomatic during his trip. After a presentation on central planning, Sanders told his Soviet peers that health care and housing were better in the United States, though they cost much more back in America. When he came home, Sanders praised Soviet train stations and ""palaces of culture."" His wife was even more effusive, almost describing the theory of New Soviet Man, when she described a cultural life that wasn't cleaved off from work, as a mere hobby, but fully integrated into an ideal of community service. Burlington's foreign policy, as it was then, was driven by idealism (some of it misguided), lots of easy talk about imperialism, and dislike of ""Ronald Ray-gun.""

By the time of his run for president in 2016, Sanders had let foreign policy drop somewhat. He was a domestic-policy candidate focused on delivering the unmet promises of mid-century liberalism: free health care and free college. His positions on Obama's intervention in Libya were unclear. He co-sponsored a bill condemning Qaddafi's regime, a vote that his opponent Hillary Clinton mischaracterized as a vote for regime change. Sanders might express hope that the military action in Libya would end and dither about his desire not to be in another quagmire, but he did not launch any direct criticism of President Obama. The U.S. policy under Obama of unrestricted drone warfare was the sort of thing that, if done by Reagan, would have had Burlington's old mayor talking about fascism and lawlessness, perhaps looking for a Houthi radio broadcast to simulcast. But when asked about it during the last election, Sanders averred only that he would use drones ""very selectively.""

But has he got a foreign policy for the 2020 campaign? New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie argues that, since his last effort, Sanders has developed a powerful and appealing foreign policy-vision for the left. And, in a certain way, Bouie is right.

Burlington has changed over the past three and a half decades; progressives have moved up in the world. And Sanders' foreign policy vision reflects the appetites and prejudices of a class that is moving up in the world.

Bouie argues that Sanders' foreign policy ""pits democratic peoples everywhere against illiberalism at home and abroad."" Sanders has characterized President Trump as one of many ""demagogues who exploit people's fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power."" Sanders lumps him together with other avatars of what he calls ""oligarchic authoritarianism,"" such as Mohammad Bin Salman, Viktor Orb√°n, Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Jair Bolsonaro.

""They share key attributes,"" Sanders claims, ""intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, constant paranoia about foreign plots, and a belief that the leaders of government should be able use their positions of power to serve their own selfish financial interests."" Sanders charged Trump with ""openly siding with the very forces challenging the democratic foundations of our longtime allies.""

Sanders' new list of enemies and priorities should be read as his attempted enlistment in the defense of the vaunted ""liberal world order."" It is his bid to join his socialist instincts to the existing foreign-policy elite's agenda. What Sanders adds to the Establishment's usual case against ""illiberalism"" is a more pointed charge of financial corruption. He's going respectable, even corporate. Like progressives, Sanders has moved up in the world. When I say that Bouie's analysis of Sanders' new position is correct, I mean that Bouie is right to sense there is political power to be had in this narrative. It would help unify the Democratic left, with the Democratic establishment.

What I'm less sure about is whether it makes any sense, or that most of the charges hurled against the illiberal and authoritarian aren't also true of liberal democracies and defenders of the liberal world order. We're told that one side is hostile to democratic norms. But our allies in Western Europe routinely discount the results of democratic elections when they get in the way of further European integration. Votes are repeated until ""the correct result"" is given. Parties such as Jeremy Corbyn's Labour run on an election manifesto of implementing the Brexit result of 2016, but are now turning around and demanding a revote.

Paranoia about foreign plots is hardly unique to populist nationalists and may in fact be even more common to partisans of the liberal world order. Vladimir Putin is popularly imagined to control Donald Trump and to have hacked Brexit. Almost every election in which liberals take a rooting interest suddenly develops a Russian subplot. The last French presidential election included charges of Russian hacking in the days before the vote. Months later security services confirmed that no such Russian hack took place. Where Russian generated memes are found, they get fewer collective impressions than a mildly popular Twitter account.

Antagonism toward a free press? Part of the modern liberal case that elections are hacked is the idea that people who vote against liberal causes are uniquely misinformed. Rupert Murdoch is held out as uniquely responsible for inflicting Trump and Brexit on the world. The EU had to explain that its post-Brexit raid of one of his offices was not revenge. One wonders if this excuse would have sufficed if it had come from east of the Elbe.

Who used their positions of power to enrich themselves? Is it just this new wave of anti-liberals? Of course not. Why couldn't Bernie have been this direct while criticizing Hillary Clinton? The Clintons became an immensely wealthy family because of the implicit promise of a Hillary administration. Emmanuel Macron is the product of a revolving door of corruption that has made elite French civil service one of the main avenues to the accumulation of wealth in France. Cronyism is almost perfected there, where privatization is a word not for creating market competition, but for licensing a class of profiteers who can be connected to state-owned or tightly regulated assets.

And intolerance of religious minorities? The party Bernie is running for contains senators who have questioned whether Catholic jurists who belong to the Knights of Columbus are able to serve the government.

Sanders' new tendency to lump together Russia, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, and Trump as one phenomenon is not perspicacious, it is slapdash. The differences between countries where journalists are murdered and those where the government withdraws advertising dollars from critical newspapers are not differences of intensity, but of kind. Hungary's reforms have tended to tax foreign oligarchs to build out new welfare and workfare policies. Poland's supposed ""illiberal"" government instituted a massive child-welfare policy over the objections of their liberal opponents. The frame of oligarchy is not helpful for understanding Saudi Arabia's actions, which are driven by sectarianism.

Burlington's new foreign policy reflects the gentrification of the Left. Instead of cultivating a na√Øvet√© about America's enemies, it projects its image of domestic enemies upon the geopolitical stage. And it cultivates in its adherents precisely the faults it once detected in Ronald Reagan and conservatives: ideologically induced blindness to its own moral failings, and hubris in action.",709,nationalreview.com,Burlington's Foreign Policy | National Review

At one point in the hearing, because not enough Democrats attended the hearing, Rep. Gohmert decided to adjourn the meeting.

The Texas conservative said at the hearing, ""The ideas of eliminating cows or air travel are not promising starting points,"" citing some possible solutions proposed in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey's (D-MA) Green New Deal.

Gohmert then called for a motion to adjourn in which the chair of the hearing ruled that, via a voice vote, the Democrats won the motion to adjourn. However, Rep. Gohmert requested a recorded vote and the Republicans won the motion so the hearing soon ended.

Congressman Gohmert told Breitbart News in an exclusive comment on Tuesday that the Democrats' hearing was about nothing more than politics.

""Even though this hearing included climate change discussion for the SEVENTH time, most of the hearing involved subjects clearly outside the jurisdiction of our Natural Resources subcommittee.

""While traumatic brain injury from contact sports, labor standards, occupational safety, and the opioid crisis deserve congressional scrutiny and are exceedingly important issues, our committee had no jurisdiction over them, meaning this hearing was all about politics and nothing at all about legislation that would fix any of these problems.

""When even the bulk of the Democrats would not attend the hearing, it made no sense to continue the hearing about matters our committee was not allowed to fix, so I made the motion to adjourn.

"Mary Ann Lisanti, a white Maryland Democrat legislator, is apologizing to black lawmakers for referring to a county as ""n***r district,"" but claims ""everyone"" has used the racial slur.

Delegate Lisanti reportedly used the racist slur to describe Prince George's County -- which is 62 percent African American -- while conversing with a colleague during an after-hours gather at a bar in Annapolis.

According to the Washington Post, Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland confronted the Democrat legislator, whose district includes Harford County, over the alleged slur.

Caucus chair Del. Darryl Barnes (D) of Prince George's County, told the Post that Lisanti was ""contrite"" when pressed about the comment, calling her reaction ""really disturbing.""

""She apologized several times,"" said Barnes. ""She recognizes how she has hurt so many within the caucus, and she hoped to repent from this.""

""She said that she doesn't remember fully what happened, but she recognizes what happened,"" he added.

In a statement, House Speaker Michael Busch demanded Lisanti ""face the consequences of her behavior.""

""There is no place in the House of Delegates for any racial slurs -- or slurs of any kind in society in general,"" the Democrat from Anne Arundel added.

While Lisanti did not respond to requests for comment from several news outlets, the Harford lawmaker did tell the Post that she does not remember using the racist slur -- before claiming she was ""sure everyone has used it.""

""I've used the f-word. I used the Lord's name in vain,"" she added.

"Parts of the Left's mockery industry are having a go at me this afternoon for a short segment I did on MSNBC this morning. The host, Stephanie Ruhle, asked me about Elizabeth Warren's pledge not to do big-dollar donor events. I was not impressed. Then, this happened:

I argued that given the stakes involved in American politics -- and the high degree of voter ignorance -- that I wasn't convinced that there was ""too much money in politics."" Stephanie was surprised by my answer, and the Raw Story described her reaction with this amusing headline: ""MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle drops some side-splitting mockery on conservative for his strange defense of money in politics."" Media Matters dutifully covered the moment, and a Kos diarist said that my argument was ""astonishingly dishonest and moronic.""

Calling something moronic or dishonest doesn't make it so, and I have some pretty compelling facts on my side. The 2018 Congressional campaign was the costliest in history, at an estimated price tag of $5 billion. In 2016, election spending for control of the presidency and Congress hit $6.5 billion. That's an enormous sum, right? We're spending way too much on, well, deciding the leadership of the free world, questions of war and peace, and the shape of our national health system, right? Well, if you believe that we should spend dramatically less on elections than we spend on pet food. Heck, we spend almost as much on pet grooming and boarding as we do on selecting the men and women who govern the world's sole superpower.

As I argued in the segment, money buys direct access to voters. It allows candidates to share their message without media filtering. It allows them to become household names, to define themselves, and to tell their story. Of course -- as Stephanie notes in response -- much of modern candidate advertising is stupid and mendacious, but that's because so many of our candidates are stupid and mendacious. But, fortunately, when you can gain direct access to voters, you at least have a chance of rebutting the worst claims without relying on media interest, fairness, or ""fact checks.""

Moreover, the absence of money doesn't necessarily mean the presence of integrity or a leveling of the playing field. Candidates have to become known somehow, and if that somehow in any way relies on the often-fickle access to cable news and their segmented audiences, then they're only reaching a slice of the electorate. They have to penetrate the broader culture. One way to do that -- in the absence of cash -- is with existing fame, something that Donald Trump exploited to the hilt in 2016. In fact, his fame helped provide him with an immense earned-media advantage. If you're a news producer, and you're given the choice between hosting a relatively unknown Republican or one of America's most famous people, which person would you choose? Do we really want to create and maintain political system that provides celebrities with even more built-in advantages?

Indeed, the argument against money in politics often isn't so much against an argument against money itself but rather an argument against private money. Public financing schemes proliferate on the Left, placing the levers of political financing in the hands of elected political officials and often requiring members of the public subsidize views they detest. A ""forced to fund"" model is disrespectful of individual liberty, and it creates a whole host of political challenges in determining how money is allocated. Asking politicians to petition their government for money is hardly inherently preferable to asking them to petition citizens for necessary funds. In fact, the early quest for campaign cash often provides a nice test of a politician's appeal.

Given the choice between government allocations and the free funding choices of a free people, I'll take freedom. As for the amounts? We're talking about spending money to communicate political arguments to a continent-sized democracy of more than 300 million souls. It can take hundreds of millions to market something as inconsequential as a single movie. Spending a few billion to decide who has the authority to spend trillions is hardly a national scandal. In fact, we could stand to spend more. Outside of the political subculture, Americans often hear too little from candidates and know too little about the people they support. Let the mockers mock. We need more speech, and more speech requires more money. I know that politics isn't everything, but it's at least as important as dog food.",712,nationalreview.com,"No, There's Not Too Much Money in Politics | National Review"
"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) participated in a town hall event that aired on CNN Monday as part of his campaign for the 2020 election-but some online sleuths have discovered that the audience may have been stacked against him.

During the event, a young woman who asked Sanders a critical question about allegations of sexual harassment in his campaign was introduced as a student at American University.

However, the student was also reportedly an intern for Cassidy & Associates, a large lobbying firm in Washington, D.C.

According to a report from Paste Magazine, this wasn't the only fishy audience member. Several audience members were introduced without disclosing their professional ties to politics. Two audience members actually worked within the Democratic Party establishment.

-- CNN called Tara Ebersole a ""former biology professor"" when her LinkedIn page lists her current job description as ""Chair, Baltimore County Democratic Party"" since 2016. Further, her husband was part of Hillary Clinton's leadership council in Baltimore in 2016.

-- Abena McAllister was labeled ""an active Democrat,"" which is far less descriptive than the Charles County Democratic Central Committee's description of her as their Chair.

-- Yunjung Seo was simply called a ""George Washington Student"" by CNN, despite her LinkedIn page saying she also works for the Katz Watson Group, a fundraising and consulting outlet.

-- Michelle Gregory was simply listed as a ""Maryland voter"" by CNN, but a cursory Google search reveals her to be much more active in politics than just voting.

The Paste article notes that the questions asked by these audience members weren't necessarily unfair, but that the connections of the members will raise skepticism about CNN's intentions.

While Sanders is a darling of many millennial voters who support further-left policies, many establishment Democrats dislike the Vermont independent.

After running a tough primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton herself blamed Sanders for helping Trump win. In her book, What Happened, Clinton writes, ""His attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump's 'Crooked Hillary' campaign.""

Some Democrats also see him as being unable to represent the increasingly diverse party as he is an older white male.

Sanders announced his 2020 candidacy last week, saying, ""Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.""",713,Breitbart,CNN Accused of Colluding with Dems During Bernie Sanders Town Hall
"THE ROOT: Should black people get reparations?

KAMALA HARRIS: I think there has to be some form of reparations. We can discuss what that is, but look, we're looking at more than 200 years of slavery. We're looking at almost a hundred years of Jim Crow. We're looking at legalized segregation and, in fact, segregation on so many levels that exists today, based on race. And there has not been any kind of intervention done understanding the harm and the damage that occurred to correct course, and so we are seeing the effects of all of those years play out still today.

THE ROOT: And as president, you would be willing to lead a conversation about what reparations for black people would look like?

KAMALA HARRIS: Yeah, including things like what we should be doing to take very seriously undiagnosed and untreated trauma. Take that very seriously, and what kind of resources are we going to put in that? What kind of resources are we going to put in communities to help folks heal and be on an equal footing?

...

If we are pretending to be and say that we are a society that values equality under the law -- look, right across the street is the United States Supreme Court. In that marble is inscribed, ""Equal Under Law,"" well if everyone is equal, that is a concept that we value, which we say we do, part of the foundational values and ideals of our country, equality, then we have to understand, we're not all being born, and we're not all living on equal ground in terms of opportunity for success. And certain things are a result of the dark history -- the history of crime -- that has occurred in this country, and we're not going to be able to correct course without serious intervention.

Harris also said, ""On the issue of race in America, let's be very clear that we had years where people were talking about, 'Are we a post-racial society?' Which I have rejected since the moment that discussion began. No, we are not. Race is still a big issue in America.""

According to Harris, the Russian government somehow affected 2016's presidential election with racial propaganda. She said:

[Russia] tested out different issues, different subjects, to see what would cause tension, what would draw heat to make the American public fight with each other, and the issue that attracted the most heat was race. So what does that tell us? Not only is the subject of race and how we acknowledge it and deal with it a function of America's identity, it is also a matter of national security, because an adversarial country -- Russia -- figured out that the subject of race is America's Achilles' heel.

"SALT LAKE CITY - Utah lawmakers moved closer Tuesday to adopting alcohol levels for beer that are in line with most production-line brews sold around the country, despite opposition from the influential Mormon church.

The state Senate overwhelming passed the measure to raise low alcohol limits on Tuesday, though it's expected to face more opposition at the state House of Representatives.

""We still have a ways to go,"" said Kate Bradshaw, a lobbyist with the Responsible Beer Choice Coalition, a group of manufacturers, distributers and sellers who support the change.

The proposal would increase the alcohol limit from 3.2 percent to 4.8 percent by weight, which would allow most standard beers to be sold in the state.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has expressed concern that the increase is too high. Most lawmakers are members of the faith that teaches abstinence from alcohol, and church positions can hold outsized sway. Many local microbreweries also oppose the change.

Still, supporters have included businesses like Wal-Mart, and the change overwhelmingly passed the state Senate. Republican sponsor Sen. Jerry Stevenson has argued the bill is about commerce rather than alcohol.

""It's a reminder that it is possible to overstate the influence the church has on politics,"" said Damon Cann, a political science professor at Utah State University. ""The church, while clearly formidable as a political foe, is not invincible.""

As other states like Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas shed similar limitations, large brewers have begun to stop making lower-alcohol products, leaving shelves emptier and hurting rural Utah stores that depend on beer revenue, Stevenson has said.

""I'm just excited to see us normalize our alcohol a little bit and I think this will be good for the state of Utah,"" said Sen. Derek Kitchen, a Democrat who identified himself as one of the handful of state senators who drink.

The state also hosts an active microbrewery community, many of whom call the measure a narrow change that would unfairly force them to quickly change their recipes.

The Utah Brewer's Guild would support a larger increase, but fears the legislation would favor larger breweries like Anheuser-Busch, said executive director Nicole Dicou. Most beer in Utah is sold at grocery and convenience stores.

Other critics worry the new limits are too high and could open the door to wine being sold in grocery stores rather than state-owned liquor outlets.

Republican Sen. Lyle Hillyard, a Mormon and an attorney who has worked in criminal defense, said he's opposed to the proposal because it poses an increased risk of drunken driving and other issues for college students.

"June 28, 2015: A man waves a rainbow flag while observing a gay pride parade in San Francisco, Calif. (Reuters)

A new state bill in California that seeks to change the way some convicted criminals are put on the sex offender registry list is sparking controversy, with some Republicans in the Golden State claiming it would shield sexual predators.

The goal of the legislation, according to California state Sen. Scott Wiener, is to bring parity to the laws governing who has to register as a sex offender in the state and to end discrimination in the courts against LGBT people.

The current law states that while consensual sex between a 15- to 17-year-old and a partner within 10 years of age is illegal, if the pair is having vaginal intercourse, a judge will decide if the accused has to register as a sex offender. Other forms of sex automatically require someone to register as a sex offender.

HOW A MINOR CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION LAW MAY HAVE DOOMED REPUBLICANS' CHANCES

The law is based on a California Supreme Court ruling that says it is not discriminatory to treat vaginal intercourse and other forms of sex differently and for harsher penalties to be implemented for the latter because the former can cause pregnancy while the others cannot.

The California lawmaker's office said that the law would result in the equal treatment of straight and LGBT young people and end the discrimination against young LGBT people engaged in consensual sexual activity.

""The judge would have discretion in these cases as to whether or not to place someone on the sex offender registry,"" Victor Ruiz-Cornejo, Wiener's communication's director, said in an email to Fox News. ""While it is most often LGBT young people that are impacted, the bill itself brings parity to the way we treat sexual acts.""

ANALYSIS: CALIFORNIA POLITICS WILL GET CRAZY IN 2019. WHAT'S THE SILVER LINING FOR THE GOP?

Republican lawmakers in California have come out strongly against the legislation - saying that the bill would allow sexual predators to lure minors to have sex with them without fear of having to register as a sex offender if caught.

""The language of the bill states that if a predator is not more than 10 years older than the minor, he or she would have an opportunity to avoid registering as a sex offender,"" Republican state Sen. Mike Morrell said in a statement to Fox News. ""This proposed legislation would place our children at risk. The bill is wrong and it is immoral.""

In a press release, the California State Senate Republican Caucus claims that, if the bill is passed, ""a 25-year-old luring a 15-year-old, a 22-year-old luring a 12-year-old, or an 19-year-old luring a 9-year-old would be shielded under the proposed legislation.""

Sponsors and supporters of the bill contest this argument, saying that the bill still maintains the provision that anyone convicted of a sexual act with a child 14 years old or younger automatically must register as a sex offender. Instead, they argue that the bill is meant to protect LGBT people in consensual sexual relationships.

""There's no reason for the law to treat a high school senior dating a high school junior differently because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" Rick Zbur, the executive director of equality California, said in a statement. ""For years, we've been working to make this common-sense fix and ensure LGBTQ young people are treated the same as their peers.""",716,Fox News,California bill to end alleged LGBT discrimination on sex offender list stirs controversy
"Gov. Cuomo for the first time Tuesday said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's political left-leaning influence played a major role in scuttling the Amazon deal to open a headquarters in Queens.

Cuomo was asked during a radio interview whether Ocasio-Ortez's stunning upset victory over Rep. Joe Crowley in last year's Democratic primary spooked local pols to flip from supporters to opponents of the project because they feared a primary challenge from progressives.

""Yes,"" Cuomo responded.

It was only last week that Cuomo played down Ocasio-Cortez's role, pointing out she wasn't directly involved.

But he changed his tune Tuesday.

""The state said we'll put forth the application only if the local politicians and community supports it. Senator [Mike] Gianaris signed the letter of support. [City Councilman Jimmy] Van Bramer signed the letter of support. We win,"" Cuomo said on WNYC radio.

Cuomo said there was a ""political shift"" after Ocasio-Cortez's victory.

""Then they oppose the very application that they supported. They signed the darn application. We win. The same people who sign it then say, 'oops the politics changed, I changed my opinion,'"" he said.

Cuomo also escalated his feud with fellow Democrats who control the state Senate for giving Gianaris veto power over the project, which he called ""irresponsible.""

""I think they should've stuck it out, but I also think you had politicians playing their own local politics and the State Senate as a body represents the entire state and should not have differed to just a local politician's political interests,"" the governor said.

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins nominated Gianaris to serve on the obscure Public Authorities Control Board, where each voting members would have had a veto on the Amazon deal.

Gianaris shot back that Cuomo negotiated a ""bad deal.""

""A real leader would take responsibility for his mistakes and learn from them instead of pointing fingers at everybody else. The fact was this was a deal the governor negotiated in secret, kept it hidden from everyone, and then once he reached a bad deal expected everyone to accept it without asking questions. That's not how it works,"" said Gianaris.

Stewart Cousins' spokesman, Mike Murphy, also slammed Cuomo for refusing to ""take any responsibility for this failure.""

""He still refuses to understand that the Legislature is a separate entity and has the right to ask questions . . . .This is a democracy not a dictatorship,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate proposed an amendment to restructure the PACB to eliminate the veto power given to a single member by allowing a majority vote to approve a project.

"Former U.S Vice president Joe Biden speaks at the University of Pennsylvania. Getty Images

Former veep Joe Biden on Tuesday dropped one of his strongest hints yet that he might seek the Democratic nomination for president -- by quoting Plato during an event at the University of Delaware.

""One of the penalties of refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors,"" he said, using the quote from the Greek philosopher to take a shot at President Trump.

Biden's jibe came during an event at the university with presidential historian Jon Meacham.

While insisting that no final decision had been made, he said that one of his primary concerns was out of the way.

After several family conversations, he said, ""there's a consensus I should, they want me to run"" for president.

""The first hurdle for me was deciding whether or not I am comfortable taking the family through what would be a very very, very difficult campaign,"" he said.

But he also continued to tease Democrats with his apparent continued indecision.

""I can die a happy man never having lived in the White House. But what I don't want to do Is take people's time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee. I think I can. I think that's where we are,"" he said.

""We're also taking a hard look at whether or not this alleged appeal I have -- how deep does it run? Is it real?"" Biden continued.

""There's still a couple hurdles to make sure this is all in place. But I'm not there yet. I don't want to mislead you. I have not made the final decision.""

The loquacious Delaware pol also said that Trump's reaction to the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., prompted both him and former President Obama to speak out about the president's equivocation sooner than they had planned.

""Barack and I agreed we were not going to comment on President Trump's administration for a year to give him a chance to get set up. We thought we'd do what [President George] W [Bush] did with us. But when Charlottesville happened, I couldn't remain silent any longer,"" he said.

And the longtime former senator fondly recalled days before partisan acrimony poisoned the upper chamber.

He said that when he first arrived in Senate he didn't know many people, but he met Sens. Ted Kennedy, William Fulbright and Jennings Randolph in the Senate gym, where ""everybody walks around in their birthday suit.""

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Socialism with a hottie face (lev radin/Shutterstock)

If you haven't read former TAC executive editor Robert Merry's piece today about how America might actually elect a socialist president, please stop whatever you're doing and take a look. You might not know that Bob was previously the editor of Congressional Quarterly, and has already forgotten more than most of us will ever know about politics. Take his piece very seriously. He writes, in part:

Axiom 4: In today's divided America, political decision making resides on a knife's edge of parity.

Trump won the presidency in 2016 by collecting just enough votes in just the right states to cadge an Electoral College victory. That means we're operating these days on the margin of politics. Even quite small swings in just a few states could turn the next election against him. And Trump, with his lack of success so far in expanding his base beyond his current 39 to 43 percent approval level, doesn't project the kind of political force that would make him a strong reelection candidate.

None of this is a prediction. A lot could happen over the next two years. But the idea that the Democrats are killing their prospects for 2020 by lurching leftward isn't based on sound analytical thinking. The four axioms above suggest that the dynamics of American politics are more complex than that.

So it's possible that the country could get, for the first time in its history, an experiment in socialist governance, mixed with a far-left push on high-voltage social issues such as immigration, political correctness, and racial politics. That would be a recipe for failure, leaving the country even more desperate for political leadership to restore stability.

Read the whole thing.

The other day, the NYT published an interesting piece about younger Britons, and why so many of them are keen on socialism. It starts like this:

Alex McIntyre was raised on budget cuts.

The youth center where he went after school was shuttered when he was 10. When he was 11, his mother's housing benefit was shaved away, a casualty of the Welfare Reform Act. By the time the streetlight in his cul-de-sac began blinking off at midnight a few years later, these events had knitted together into a single story, about a government policy that had defined his childhood.

""Austerity, that's what I know, that's my life,"" said Mr. McIntyre. ""I've never known an England that was a different way.""

Now 19 and old enough to vote, Mr. McIntyre is making up for lost time. Over the last six months, he was drawn into the center of the Momentum movement, an ideological marketplace buzzing with rebranded socialism and trade unionism. His parents may have gotten their news from The Sun and The Daily Mail, but he listens to reports on the ""crisis of capitalism"" from Novara Media, a left-wing independent media group. Over Christmas he started reading Marx.

Mr. McIntyre is the first in his family to attend college, part of a vast cohort of young Britons that was meant to embody upward social mobility. It is a paradox that so many in this bulge, like their counterparts in the United States, are giving up on free-market capitalism, convinced it cannot provide their families with a decent life.

The general election of 2017 exposed the starkest generation gap in the recent history of British politics. Young voters broke dramatically for the Labour Party, whose socialist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has promised to rebuild the welfare state and redistribute wealth. Hardened against the centrists of their parents' generation, they have tugged the party to the left, opening up rifts that are now fracturing Labour.

Keep in mind that the UK has been a welfare state since the Second World War, far more than the US has been. Still:

Unlike previous generations, they are expected to foot the bill for an expensive education. The average graduate now owes the government more than 50,800 pounds, or $64,000, a debt to be paid back gradually upon securing a well-paid job, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The portion of Britons attending college has climbed to 49 percent, the highest level ever, but they will graduate into a historic spell of wage stagnation.

Robert Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, recalled Margaret Thatcher's thesis about homeownership: By allowing low-income Britons to buy the state housing they rented, she could make them into stakeholders in market capitalism, enlarging the Tory Party. With his students, realizing in their 20s that they are not likely ever to own a home, that process has been thrown into reverse.

""All the risk has been shifted onto them,"" he said. ""They know this is not the situation their parents and grandparents were in. You've got a generation since the crisis with lower mobility and lower security. It makes them less convinced that the market delivers good outcomes.""

Read it all.

I understand why young people like McIntyre despair of capitalism, but what I don't understand is why they believe that socialism will solve their problems.

Wait, let me rephrase that: I can understand why people who know nothing about the history of socialism would think that socialism is an answer (socialism, as distinct from a modified form of capitalism). Where are the successful socialist economies? Do they really think Scandinavian political economy can work outside of Scandinavia, with its communalist traditions and relative homogeneity? Besides, as the democratic socialist writer Michael A. McCarthy writes in Jacobin, the social democracies of Scandinavia are a good first step on the road to socialism, but they are not the same thing as socialism.

I know, I know, these arguments can easily become overly intellectual in the face of declining economic and social mobility prospects. Does a young man like McIntyre, or his US counterpart, really care about the distinction between social democracy and democratic socialism? All he knows is that he won't live as well as his parents, for reasons outside of his control.

As you regular readers know, for me, the more worrying aspect of the rise of socialism is the cultural egalitarianism and soft totalitarianism that is inseparable from actual, existing leftism today, whether of the social democratic or democratic socialist kind. I don't have a book deal yet, but I'm already working on the manuscript for my next book, which will be lessons about socialism from people who lived through it in Eastern Europe and the USSR. The first two chapters after the introduction are about how and why it could happen here -- and why Republicans and other defenders of capitalism had better take income inequality and lack of social mobility far more seriously than they do, if they want to avoid a socialist future.

There are right-of-center thinkers already doing this. Ross Douthat's column today is an excellent summary of where they're headed. It's hard to find a part to excerpt, because it's all such vital reading. In short, Douthat highlights new books by Tim Carney and Oren Cass, and a couple of new essays by former TAC editor Daniel McCarthy, and by Gladden Pappin. In the essays, McCarthy and Pappin argue for a kind of American Gaullism -- that is, for conservatives to give up on the idea of limited government (which doesn't work anymore, for historical and economic reasons), and instead embrace the idea that the Right should use the state for conservative ends. If you think that ""conservative ends"" means making America safe for big business, then you really should read McCarthy and Pappin (links are in the Douthat essay) to be disabused of that notion.

Douthat writes:

And the most subtle reader might say that they're trying to provide the theory for a move that the Republican Party once in power tends to make anyway -- both of the last two G.O.P. presidents have been, in some sense, ""big government conservatives"" -- but so far without the strategy, seriousness and self-consciousness required to make the project a success.

I have enough of my own skepticism about the efficacy of state power to be uncertain if the project can succeed. But post-Trump conservatives are likely to be drawn to state-power conservatism not just by theoretical ambition but by a sense of political necessity.

The earlier conservative self-understanding, in which the right was defending nongovernmental institutions against the power of the state, tacitly depended on the assumption that many if not most nongovernmental institutions would be friendly to conservative values. But as civil society has decayed over recent decades, its remaining power centers have also become increasingly left-wing.

Already-liberal institutions -- universities, Hollywood, the big foundations and the mass media -- are now more uniformly allied with the left than even the very recent past. Corporate America happily donates to Republicans because it fears a Bernie Sanders presidency, but on cultural issues big business courts its younger customers with progressive lobbying and propaganda. In religion, Catholicism under Pope Francis aspires (scandals permitting) to ease its way leftward as well, leaving evangelical Christianity as an isolated bastion with little culture-shaping power.

Yet conservatives can still win the White House and the Congress, which means that the one power center they can hope to control is the one they are notionally organized to limit -- the administrative state.

Read all of it.

My conservatism is almost entirely cultural (religious, social). Most of my culturally conservative friends are Christians who are appalled by Trump, but who reluctantly plan to vote for him mostly because they see the judiciary as the only restraining force against militant social progressivism over the next couple of decades. In other words, the only institution capable of protecting to any degree religious and social conservatives from widely institutionalized, militant progressivism will be ... federal judges.

The main focus of my forthcoming book will be on the culture of totalitarianism, defined by Augusto Del Noce as a society in which everything is politicized (which means that totalitarianism can exist within a democracy). The forces of progressive soft totalitarianism -- by which I mean, generally, totalitarianism without a police state -- are mounting in this culture. People living here who once lived under hard totalitarianism see the signs of it everywhere -- but these signs are hidden from the rest of us, in part because we think of totalitarianism as something that requires gulags. It's not true.

Anyway, more on that later. The point here is that Bob Merry is right: real economic suffering, plus political volatility, can lead America to vote in a socialist president. I happen to think Trump's plan to run against the prospect of socialism makes sense, though Americans ought to understand that ""socialism"" today is not merely a matter of political economy, but also entails a much broader worldview that is inimical to orthodox Christianity and to tradition. That's an argument for a later time.

What I hope, though, is that enough smart Republicans are reading Cass, Carney, McCarthy, Pappin, Carlson, and other innovative thinkers on the Right, and will get their heads in the game in time to prevent a socialist president. The tragedy looming is that Trump's incompetence at governing will prevent a true American Gaullist from rising, except down the road, in reaction to actual far-left Democratic Party rule.",719,The American Conservative,"It Can Happen Here, Actually"
"I know what some of you are thinking. You read that headline and immediately think, ""alarmist clickbait."" First, no one's ending the filibuster -- at least not anytime soon. Second, even if the next Democratic Senate destroys the filibuster, what's the big deal? The Republicans will make the Democrats look as short-sighted as Harry Reid when he nuked the judicial filibuster. Both sides will get their free shot at legislation.

Yes, both sides will get their free shot, and that's exactly the problem.

Let's go back to the first question for a minute. Is there a chance that if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020, and the Democrats win a narrow majority in the Senate, they'll attempt to repeal the legislative filibuster? Will the pressure to implement a triumphant progressive president's agenda be so overwhelming that Democratic senators will feel they have no choice? After all, there's no real path to single-payer or gun control or key aspects of the Green New Deal absent the ""nuclear option.""

In fact, that's the very argument Jamelle Bouie makes in today's New York Times, in a piece urging Democratic presidential candidates to ""come out against the filibuster.""

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won't likely find it. The legislative path for their policies -- to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care -- will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

Bouie notes that most of the Democratic contenders don't favor filibuster repeal, but Elizabeth Warren has said that ""all options are on the table"" and Kamala Harris has said she is ""conflicted."" The Times' David Leonhardt used Bouie's argument as a launching pad to explore the pros and cons of filibuster reform. We are now in the midst of a live debate.

Let me begin by concurring with Bouie. Here we share an agreed upon set of facts, at least. Absent filibuster reform (or an unforeseen wave election in the Senate), our nation is presently too polarized and too closely divided to enact ""ambitious, far-reaching legislation.""

But Bouie looks at those facts and says, ""Step on the gas."" I look at them and say, ""Tap the brakes."" If we think American electoral politics are fraught now, with more apocalyptic rhetoric filling the air each day, just imagine if each new election brought with it the realistic possibility of a truly fundamental swing in national policy. Single-payer might be passed in one presidential term and upended in the next. Gun-control regimes could swing wildly from president to president. And, critically, each swing would be accompanied by a convulsive, toxic political debate that deepened and intensified American polarization.

As a caution against filibuster reform, Leonhardt points to this tweet from Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh:

Hersh is right, and his analysis applies to both parties. After all, the golden rule of modern American partisanship is do unto the other worse than they did unto you. Imagine, years down the road, sweeping California-style gun control passed after a particularly heinous mass murder, a law that would render millions of Americans criminals in an instant. It would trigger extraordinary resistance in red states and likely galvanize efforts at nullification.

Conversely, imagine Democrats' panic at the fragility of their social-justice initiatives. The instant a new Republican president and Senate was sworn in, protests would paralyze the capital as the new legislature worked quickly to repeal everything from health-care legislation to new climate-change laws.

Moreover, let's not forget that if the filibuster dies, it will die at a moment when our political culture remains in thrall to an endless cycle of Twitter-driven overreaction and outrage. The pressure for decisive legislative action in response to traumatic events will remain overwhelming. Ending the filibuster would mean that change would suddenly became not just possible but mandatory -- and, given the extent of ideological polarization, dramatic, too.

Look at this chart. Ponder this chart. Memorize this chart:

Gone are the nice ideological bell curves of American generations past, when large majorities shared a degree of relative moderation. Welcome to an America that's trending closer to a ""U"" curve, in which the two sides glare at each other from across a widening chasm.

Using temporary, slim majorities to push sweeping, nation-changing legislation is like playing with matches in a gasoline spill. At the very least, it's a recipe for increasing bitterness, division, and instability in public policy. At worst, it's a recipe for outright state-level defiance. I wonder: How would blue states respond if a slight GOP majority passed a national heartbeat bill, a law that would essentially ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy? It's easy to imagine a meltdown.

And don't for one moment believe that overreach isn't inevitable. If there is one thing that's constant in modern American politics, it's irrational partisan exuberance after every electoral win. Even close wins -- like Trump's in 2016 -- usher in talk of ""permanent realignments."" Partisans behave as if a mandate exists for their policies whether it actually does or not.

Finally, lest we despair of ever enacting meaningful reform, let's not forget that patient and persistent public advocacy can still work. Just recently, Congress passed criminal-justice reform with huge bipartisan majorities -- a monumental change that was politically unthinkable not very long ago. No, it's not the national transformation that activists seek, but Pyrrhic legislative victories aren't victories at all, and sweeping change absent sweeping consensus will inflict deep costs on the American body politic.

The filibuster helps lower the true stakes of American elections. It's one of the last measures left in American politics that limits the centralization of power. And it helps ensure that significant reform carries with it significant public support. It's a check on the very forces that could tear our nation apart. It must be preserved.",720,nationalreview.com,"If Democrats End the Filibuster, It Could Break American Politics"
"Pompeo delivered his response to Zarif's resignation while in transit to Vietnam for the second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un:

Hassan Rouhani is the president of Iran and head of the secular wing of Iranian government. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei controls the religious wing of the government, and in Pompeo's estimation is far more important than Rouhani.

Zarif announced the end of his six year career as foreign minister via Instagram on Monday evening, but as of Tuesday afternoon, Rouhani has not accepted it, instead praising his foreign minister as an effective adversary of the United States, leading to Pompeo's cynicism about whether Zarif is truly resigning.

Rouhani's chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi posted a friendly photo of Rouhani and Zarif on Instagram Tuesday and interpreted Rouhani's praise for Zarif as a ""clear sign of the satisfaction of the representative of the people of Iran about the wise and effective positions and work of Dr. Zarif and a tough response to some biased and incorrect analyses.""

""In the view of Dr. Rouhani, the Islamic Republic of Iran has only one foreign policy and one foreign minister,"" Vaezi declared.

A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Rouhani has refused to accept Zarif's resignation.

Zarif gave an interview on Tuesday in which he sounded like he was still an active player in Iranian politics. He implied his offer of resignation was an act of protest against ""hardliners"" in Iran who are opposed to honoring the nuclear deal with its remaining signatories now that the United States has withdrawn.

""We first have to remove our foreign policy from the issue of party and factional fighting. The deadly poison for foreign policy is for foreign policy to become an issue of party and factional fighting,"" Zarif said, as quoted by the al-Jazeera news service.

These hardliners are ostensibly trying to sabotage Europe's attempt to create a new financial system for trade with Iran by stalling legislation that must be passed before Iran could sign the deal. Zarif and his faction have often portrayed the hardliners as opposed to establishing better ties with the West or upset that Iran made too many concessions to obtain the nuclear deal from the Obama administration.

Both of those storylines were very popular with the Obama administration, but critics maintain - as Pompeo suggested in his tweet - that real power has always been in the hands of the hardline theocracy and everything else is a theatrical production to convince Westerners that Iran is growing more moderate and secular.

""There were closed-door meetings every week, where top officials were bombarding him with questions about the deal and what will happen next and so on. He and his boss [Rouhani] were under a huge amount of pressure,"" an anonymous ally of Zarif told Reuters.

Another Iranian official ""close to the hardline camp"" suggested to Reuters that Khamenei can easily end the crisis in a ""good way"" and ""narrow the gap between different political camps"" by expressing support for Zarif.

A third Reuters source in Iran worried about the opposite outcome, as Zarif's resignation could trigger a ""domino effect"" that causes other ministers, and possibly Rouhani himself, to resign.

Zarif resigned just a few hours after Syrian President Bashar Assad visited Tehran and met with Khamenei and Rouhani. The foreign minister was surprisingly absent from these meetings.

The Jerusalem Post quoted rumors in Iranian media that Zarif disagreed with Rouhani about keeping Iranian forces in Syria and interpreted the lack of an invitation to attend the meeting with Assad as a deliberate snub.

Zarif's only comment on his absence was a cryptic text message that said he would ""no longer have credibility in the world as the foreign minister"" after photos of Assad meeting with Khamenei and Rouhani were published.

A source told al-Jazeera that Zarif's public offer of resignation was tentative and ""talks are underway to dissuade him from the decision.""

The Iranian parliament announced on Tuesday that it will investigate Zarif's resignation.

""With attention to the internal and international situation, sanctions and the pressure from America, I emphasize that more than any other time we need internal unity and solidarity,"" said a spokesman for the parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Commission.",721,Breitbart,Pompeo: Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif 'Front Man for Religious Mafia'
"There were plenty of snubs in the Oscar's annual In Memoriam segment Sunday night, but a political blacklist is the only possible reason for the Academy's decision to shun the great R. Lee Ermey.

Stanley Donen? He died just hours prior to the telecast.

Oscar nominee Sondra Locke? She has been out of the public eye for decades.

This snub is without question the act of Hollywood blacklisters who want the man erased, memory-holed, and forgotten... A man who's personal political beliefs are verboten in an increasingly fascist industry.

Ermey was a Marine for 11 years and a decorated Vietnam veteran. When he retired from the Corps in 1972 due to injuries, he jumped into the motion picture business as a technical adviser. This led to a storied acting career that anyone with any aspiration in that field would envy.

Above all that, though, Ermey created one of the most iconic performances in the history of cinema as Gny. Sgt Hartman in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 masterpiece Full Metal Jacket. In fact, you could argue Ermey's performance is the most iconic of that particular decade.

And yet... Watch right here on Sunday night as Hollywood blacklists Ermey for holding unacceptable political beliefs:

I don't want to be in the business of naming all those who were honored Sunday night even though they are objectively less deserving than Ermey. Hey, God bless them, they all deserve it, as did those mentioned above, like Sondra Locke and Verne Troyer. In a three-plus hour show, this is where these bastards choose to cut?

Ermey is different, though, an iconic presence and voice who was a welcome part of our lives for decades. The Academy's snub is inexplicable -- unless you look at the fact that Ermey was a proud and open Republican and defender of the 2nd Amendment.

Here is TCM's annual In Memoriam tribute, which has never engaged in blacklisting. Naturally, Ermey receives his due:

P.S. Forget about the politics for a moment and just compare the Oscar tribute to the TCM tribute -- look at the quality of the work, which one is the most moving and compelling. How is it that a cable network simply blows away the Motion Picture Academy every year?

The Academy has access to the finest editors in the world, and their In Memoriam segment is bland, lifeless, hollow-eyed, and dull. Meanwhile, year after year after year, TCM wrenches our hearts.",722,Breitbart,Nolte: R. Lee Ermey Blacklisted By Oscar's In Memoriam Tribute
"A new report is exposing the hypocrisy of the supposed climate change crusader.

Bernie Sanders' Democratic presidential campaign is experiencing a major shakeup, with several top advisers heading for the exits, just one week after the Vermont senator launched his second bid for the White House.

Three of the top advisers who helped propel the senator's 2016 White House bid -- Tad Devine, Julian Mulvey, and Mark Longabaugh -- are parting ways with Sanders, the campaign confirmed Tuesday.

EX-SANDERS SPOKESMAN CALLS HILLARY CLINTON TEAM CHOICE WORDS IN INTERVIEW

Sanders 2020 campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement to Fox News that ""the campaign appreciates all the good work DML has done and wishes them well."" DML is the name of the political consulting firm headed up by Devine, Mulvey and Longabaugh.

""The entire firm has stepped away. We're leaving the campaign ... We just didn't have a meeting of the minds,"" Longabaugh told NBC News, which was first to report the departure of the senior strategists.

Devine, a veteran political strategist who was a top adviser to the presidential campaigns of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 and then-Sen. John Kerry in 2004, served as Sanders' chief strategist and leading surrogate in 2016. Longabaugh steered the campaign's game plan for winning delegates and negotiating with the Democratic National Committee. Mulvey played a large role in creating the campaign's television and digital ads.

Sanders, once a longshot for the 2016 Democratic nomination, crushed Hillary Clinton by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, launching him into a marathon battle with the eventual nominee that didn't end until after the primary and caucus calendar concluded.

BERNIE SANDERS BOASTS OF 'HISTORIC' MILESTONE, SAYS 1 MILLION VOLUNTEERS SIGNED UP FOR CAMPAIGN

But this time, Sanders is running in a crowded field with several other liberal Democrats, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris, with others expected to join the race.

On Monday, Sanders' campaign sought to demonstrate the enthusiasm for his campaign by reporting that 1 million people had already signed up to volunteer. As of Monday, six days after his campaign launch, the senator also had raised an eye-popping $10 million from over 359,914 donors. Those numbers put him far ahead of his rivals for the nomination in the race for campaign cash.

But Sanders has also drawn fire from former aides to Clinton, who leaked details about Sanders' use of private jets in 2016 to attend campaign rallies on her behalf. That provoked Sanders' 2016 campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, to tell Politico that Clinton's staff are the ""biggest a--holes in American politics,"" adding that Clinton is ""one of the most disliked politicians in America.""

Meanwhile, during a CNN town hall on Monday night, Sanders promised to release his taxes soon but downplayed the unveiling by saying ""they're very boring tax returns.""

Sanders faced some criticism for not releasing his taxes during his marathon 2016 primary battle with Hillary Clinton. He said Monday he would have done so had he beat Clinton.

"MIAMI -- When Vice President Pence visited here recently, he didn't go straight to Little Havana for cafecito at Versailles, a traditional stop for politicians. Instead, he visited a church in Doral, a suburban community home to one of the city's fastest-growing immigrant groups.

As Venezuelans have fled their country in staggering numbers, many have resettled in South Florida, becoming a growing cultural and political force in an area that for years has largely been dominated by Cubans.

Miami now has the largest Venezuelan ex-pat community in the United States, and they have altered the landscape in a city that already has a melting pot of immigrants. That dynamic is reshaping Miami politics and becoming a growing influence in both Washington and Caracas.

""The South Florida Venezuelans are the politically influential portions of the population now. They are the ones that are going to be involved in regime change and rebuilding Venezuela,"" Touchton said.

BERNIE SANDERS REFUSES TO CALL VENEZUELA'S MADURO 'DICTATOR,' SAYS 'DEMOCRATIC OPERATIONS TAKING PLACE'

United Nations research shows that since 2014, an estimated 3 million people have fled Venezuela, which is about 10 percent of the country's population. More than 200,000 Venezuelans live in Florida, according to a 2018 University of Miami study.

Doral, the heart of the Venezuelan community, is west of Miami and is bustling with Venezuelan culture. At one popular restaurant, El Arepaso, a large Venezuelan flag flutters on the roof. It's just one of many businesses that many Venezuelan-Americans said makes them feel like they are home.

Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, who is Cuban-American, said the Venezuelan community has become a force in South Florida - and could one day hold as much sway politically in the region as Cubans do in Miami.

""While the Cuban population may be larger than the Venezuelan population, I think that is something that you will see, if the situation does not get addressed, we will continue to see more and more exiles here from Venezuela,"" Nunez said.

Much like the Puerto Ricans in Orlando, Venezuelans are attracting the attention of both political parties and candidates hoping to court them. Republicans, particularly, have blamed the political crisis in Venezuela on socialism, using it as an example of what happens when a far left-leaning regime is in power.

The Trump administration has been vocal in condemning Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro and urging him to step aside. Trump visited Miami last week and gave a rousing anti-socialism speech, saying what happened in Miami ""will never happen to us.""

""The days of socialism and communism are numbered,"" Trump said. ""Not only in Venezuela but in Nicaragua and in Cuba, as well.""

Democratic leaders and 2020 candidates recently began calling attention to the issue, with Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders calling for free elections and humanitarian aid to be allowed in Venezuela. But some Venezuelans have questioned whether the criticism goes far enough.

In a state where major elections are often decided by a handful of votes, University of Miami political science professor Michael Touchton said Venezuelans in Miami could sway future elections.

It's still unclear whether the Venezuelan crisis will draw the community to the Republican Party like the Cuban missile crisis prompted many Cubans to shift right.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and top Senate Democrats are working together on legislation that would allow Venezuelans to stay in the U.S. with temporary protection from work permits and deportation. Rubio's Democratic colleague, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, said in a statement, ""providing temporary protected status for eligible individuals ... is the humanitarian and morally responsible thing to do.""

Rubio said granting temporary protected status would provide a solution to Venezuelans who fear returning home.

Touchton, the political science professor, said the issue has political implications.

""If regime change occurs in Venezuela, while Trump is in office, he will benefit politically, and Republicans will benefit politically, from those votes in South Florida,"" he said.

Pence on Monday went to Colombia to speak with leaders and rally the international community behind opposition leader Juan Guaid√≥. The vice president announced that the United States will provide an additional $56 million in aid to Venezuela.

""The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy,"" Pence said.

Blanco Luis, a Venezuelan immigrant living in Miami, said he's keeping a close eye on what happens in his home country.

""I am really sad about the people over there. I have a lot of family over there, they don't have any food. No jobs, no transportation, no medicine,"" Luis said.

Stephany Melchor moved to Miami in 2016, leaving her family to pursue a future she could never have back home. ""I decided to come here. I had the support of my two brothers and I started over,"" she said.

Melchor says many Venezuelans are grateful the United States stepped up to intervene amid the political crisis.

""Coming from a person so powerful as the president of the United States,"" Melchor said, ""is actually a relief.""",724,Fox News,Venezuelans becoming a growing political and cultural force in South Florida
"Embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused the ""extremist Ku Klux Klan government that Donald Trump directs"" of trying to concoct a crisis in his country in an attempt to spark a war in South America.

""Everything that the United States government has done has been doomed to failure,"" the hard-left socialist told ABC News. ""They are trying to fabricate a crisis to justify political escalation and a military intervention in Venezuela to bring a war to South America.""

Asked by ABC News' Tom Llamas in the presidential palace in Caracas if he thinks the US wants to invade Venezuela, Maduro said: ""The United States wants oil from Venezuela and is willing to go on a war for oil.""

He called it ""a crazy plan. It's an extremist plan, because Venezuela is a pacifist, humble nation"" - and accused Washington of inventing ""pretexts.""

""The humanitarian crisis, the violation of human rights, the lack of democracy and supposedly to come to help the Venezuelan people they are going to send the Marines,"" he said.

""They are going to bomb us, they are going to destroy the country. They are excuses for an escalation, a military invasion, that is why they say all options are on the table.""

A political and economic crisis reached a new pitch in Venezuela last month when Juan Guaido, president of the country's National Assembly, declared himself interim president in opposition to Maduro's government.

On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Bogota, Colombia, where he met with Guaido, whom the US and 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We are with you 100 percent,"" Pence told Guaido as he announced that the US will provide an additional $56 million in aid to the Venezuelan people.

The Treasury Department also announced Monday that it was imposing new sanctions on four Venezuelan governors connected to Maduro's government.

Maduro said the meeting in Bogota was ""part of that politics to attempt to establish a parallel government in Venezuela outside of the constitution.""

""When have we seen, in 200 years of relations between the United States and Venezuela, that the United States would decide without going through an election without a popular vote that in Venezuela there would be another president,"" he said.

""When have we seen that? Never. I think this is extreme politics doomed to fail that nothing good comes out for the US or Venezuela.""

Maduro also appeared to be willing to give Trump a pass for referring to him as a ""Cuban puppet.""

""I do not know if Trump believes what is written for him for his speeches that he goes out and reads. I am capable to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is repeating what is written for him,"" he said.

And asked if he fears the US president, Maduro said: ""I fear the people that are around him,"" citing ""extremist"" national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who ""has an antiquated scheme of old intelligence from the Cold War,"" and Vice President Mike Pence, ""a man that does not know world politics.""

""I think these people surrounding President Trump are bad. And I think that at one point, President Trump will have to say, 'Stop, stop, we have to see what happens with Venezuela,' and change his politics.""

Maduro said he also would be willing to meet Trump face to face.

""If it is about Venezuela's peace, our region's peace, of the development of our nation and friendly relations with the United States, I would be willing to go wherever I would have to go,"" he said.

"With the second summit on February 27-28 between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un - this time in Vietnam - the question to be asked is: Who holds the high ground when the two leaders negotiate the issue of Pyongyang terminating its nuclear and missile programs?

There should be little doubt North Korea will do whatever it can to retain its programs as, for Kim, these are important bragging rights with his military. In dealing with his Trump ""problem,"" we can expect Kim to employ ""tricks of the trade"" utilized by Iran's mullahs in negotiating their nuclear deal - one heavily slanted in their favor as a result under President Barack Obama.

The nuclear deal proved to be a goldmine for Tehran, allowing it to deceive the West on its compliance. This was an obvious outcome of a deal that even outrageously permitted Iran to inspect itself to ensure compliance.

Any effort by Kim to discuss a deal ending his nuclear program would be undertaken in a similar vein as undertaken by the Iranians-whose program is still active. Kim will only want an agreement heavily weighted in his favor as well and, like the mullahs, will promise to do that which he has no intention of doing to achieve it.

Kim is already on record saying he wants an Iran-like deal. Thus, Trump will have his hands full trying, unlike Obama, not to negotiate a similar one-sided agreement. In giving away so much to Iran earlier, Obama's negotiators, unfortunately, leave Trump's negotiators in a difficult bargaining position. And Kim will take anything less than an Iran deal as a slap in the face.

Trump and Kim will enter their second meeting with two different negotiating strengths.

On September 2, 2018, Pyongyang tested a thermonuclear weapon, boasting it could fit the new device on an advanced intercontinental missile (ICBM). Soon thereafter, South Korean intelligence reported the North was moving an ICBM in preparation for another test launch over the northern Pacific and possibly Japan.

Not to be intimidated, Trump gave the order to the U.S. military to shoot down and destroy any North Korean missile headed toward the continental U.S., Hawaii, or Guam.

Trump's response to Kim's boastful challenge was necessary for dealing with a dictator used to intimidating others. While it may well have given Kim pause to consider the fact Trump was no Obama push-over, five months later, Trump made an ill-advised statement that undercut this strength, undoubtedly encouraging the North Korean dictator to play hardball during the upcoming summit meeting.

The unsolicited statement by Trump was made as envoys from both sides met to discuss the parameters of the second meeting. Trump said, while he sought Pyongyang's de-nuclearization, he was ""in no rush"" to accomplish it. Kim obviously saw this comment as giving him some breathing room. This is important to the delaying tactics Kim can be expected to employ as he seeks to wait out a Trump presidency, hoping it is just one term but prepared to employ further delays should it go for two terms.

Additional encouragement for Kim to delay is the domestic opposition against Trump. Kim has observed Democrats put much more importance on party politics than on America's national security, ignoring the later to focus on impeaching Trump as the threat.

For eight years under the Obama Administration, our national security suffered as enemies like Iran and North Korea advanced their interests due to our having elected a president who was simply incapable of understanding the threat. While we now have a president who understands it, those enemies are still able to make headway because we have an opposition party failing to understand it. As such, we really cannot expect too much substance to come out of the Trump/Kim summit.

Sadly, we have met the greatest threat to our national security and it is us!",726,Breitbart,Zumwalt: The Greatest Threat to the Trump/Kim Summit
"There is a strange political conversation under way as the 2020 Democratic presidential primary gets under way, and it goes like this: One group of Democrats proposes something daffy, vague, and impractical, and another group of Democrats says, ""Of course that's daffy, vague, and impractical -- but at least they started a conversation!"" This is said in the tone kindergarten teachers use with toddlers who test the maxim that there is no such thing as a dumb question. It's something to see: a political party condescending to itself.

None of the Democratic 2020 contenders currently talking up reparations for slavery is serious about the project. Those of them who are serious about anything are serious only about winning the party's nomination and the role that flattering a small but influential congregation of left-wing intellectuals might play in that.

Call it the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary.

It's an unserious proposal, but we'll do its authors the courtesy of offering a serious answer, anyway.

Paying reparations for slavery is a terrible idea because there is no one to pay reparations and no one to pay them to. There are not any slave-owners left among us and haven't been for some time. There aren't any liberated slaves, either. Slavery was a terrible crime and, like all such enormities, it was carried out by real people who inflicted unconscionable suffering on real people -- specific people, individuals.

Our progressive friends like to talk about their high regard for ""diversity,"" but they are blind to the real thing: Neither the white population of the United States nor the black one is homogenous; relatively few living white Americans are the heirs, however distant, of slave owners, and a significant and growing population of black Americans has no link to antebellum slavery at all. Some of them, like Barack Obama, are the offspring of more recent African immigrants; others are immigrants from the Caribbean and elsewhere who may have family links to slavery but not to American slavery. The question of what it means to be an ""African American"" grows more complex by the day.

Such considerations are significant if we are to avoid sinking into the morass of willful racism as a public-policy criterion, insisting upon collective racial culpability and collective racial entitlement. These ideas are alien to the fundamental American creed of individual rights and individual liberties -- indeed, we have been at our very worst on racial issues when we as a nation have failed to live up to those ideals, as unfortunately has been the case all too often in our history.

None of this diminishes the unique evil that was American slavery, or the ways in which African Americans have been -- and, in some cases, remain -- systematically disadvantaged both by formal policy and by ordinary private prejudice. And it is not the case that all of these disadvantages are the result of poverty and hence easily addressed by policies that take no account of race, racism, or the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow. But neither is it the case that these persistent problems are likely to be solved by a series of cash transfers administered by self-seeking political entrepreneurs.

To insist that our public policies do not entrench collectivist racial politics is not the same as naively pretending that the world takes no notice of race or that it does not matter. And we should be willing to consider uncomfortable questions related to that: Why is it that black students are comparatively ill-served by our public schools even where per-student spending matches or exceeds that in largely white schools? Why is it that local authorities in cities such as Philadelphia and Los Angeles tolerate so much more public disorder and dysfunction in black neighborhoods? Talking about reparations is, in part, a way to avoid talking about that, because it's of no help in the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary.",727,nationalreview.com,The Reparations Primary | National Review
"The impermanent nature of politics being what it is, what was unthinkable in the past becomes debatable in the present and conventional wisdom in the future. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's call for a borderless hemisphere in the 2016 election has given way to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's declaration that illegal aliens are actually more American than those who would strengthen our borders, which has in turn given way to former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams's endorsement of noncitizens' voting in American elections.

This latter idea may strike many conservatives as another example of the Left's new leaders embracing radicalism, but the history and ideology of this issue are more interesting than that. I strongly oppose noncitizen voting, and have introduced a bill to ban all federal funding for states and municipalities that allow the practice, but I fear that, unless we understand the history of noncitizen voting and the ideology that underpins it, conservatives will be ill-equipped to oppose future waves of activism in this area.

Noncitizen voting was actually the status quo for much of U.S. history. It wasn't until 1926 that Arkansas became the last state to ban noncitizens from voting, and 1928 that the first federal election without enfranchised aliens occurred. Since Article I of the Constitution provides that those who can vote in elections for the most numerous house of their state legislature may vote in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, many congresses in our history have seen members elected from constituencies with significant populations of alien voters.

Initially after the ratification of the Constitution, Congress promoted alien voting, partly as an incentive for the settlement of new territories. Section eleven of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 provided that ownership of 50 acres of land ""and two years residence in the district, shall be necessary to qualify a man as an elector of a representative"" regardless of citizenship status. Alien suffrage peaked in the years after the Civil War - at least 22 states and territories allowed noncitizen voting around 1875. In my home state of South Carolina, the post-Civil War constitution of 1865 joined those of a number of other southern states in allowing aliens who had declared their intent to become citizens to vote.

As property qualifications fell away and women won the right to vote, noncitizen voting became more controversial. The rising tide of nationalist sentiment during World War I ultimately brought the practice to an end. Meanwhile, voting rights were expanding across the country to varying degrees, and would further expand later in the 20th century with the rightly celebrated Voting Rights Act of 1965 and bills to provide better access to voting for uniformed servicemembers abroad, among various other civil-rights bills.

But throughout the voting-rights debates of the civil-rights era, alien voting remained a fringe concept, relegated only to the most left-leaning jurisdictions. New York allowed aliens to vote in certain school board elections in 1968, but few municipalities followed suit. After the issue was taken up as a left-wing cause in the 1990s, we ended up pretty much where we are today, with around a dozen different jurisdictions across Maryland, California, Illinois, and New York offering noncitizens and even illegal immigrants access to the ballot.

In the service of their renewed push for noncitizen voting, leftists characterize noncitizen voting as a ""logically unassailable, if not clearly mandatory, democratic practice."" Their theory places restrictions on the franchise for aliens into the same category as previous discriminatory efforts to restrict minority groups' access to voting. If advocates of noncitizen voting are right, it is not principle, but political expediency, that keeps them from advancing this policy. They make three main arguments: that noncitizen voting is required by the social contract, that political outcomes will be biased against noncitizens without the franchise, and that noncitizen voting presents benefits to all voters in a given jurisdiction.

Each of these is wrong in its own way. The social-contract argument boils down to ""no taxation without representation."" In other words, aliens are required to pay taxes and potentially serve in the armed forces, and therefore they're entitled to voting representation. But aliens are not entitled to all of the rights and privileges afforded to Americans. For instance, someone with a green card who commits a crime can be deported from the United States, a penalty that would not be available or fair for a naturalized citizen. Other rights not universally afforded to aliens in the United States are the right to serve on juries, run for public office, or access certain government jobs.

If the social-contract argument is taken to be legitimate, then no country is entitled to distinguish between citizens and noncitizens, provided that the noncitizens pay taxes. It would preclude countries from providing different rights to different people based on immigration status. At any given moment, there are millions of people who live and work in our country on temporary employment visas, receive Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or occupy other immigration categories who cannot vote. Their residence is either permanent or semi-permanent.

The second argument for noncitizen voting is that it is discriminatory to prevent illegal aliens from voting, and that as a result, the laws that are made will be biased against those who lack representation. This is the same argument that was made in favor of allowing 18-year-olds to vote - if someone were going to be sent to Vietnam, he should get to choose his elected leaders. There's one key difference, however, between an 18-year-old getting drafted with no voting rights and an alien: the 18-year-old did not choose his condition.

An alien voluntarily comes to the United States in search of a better life, hoping to work and to be part of the American experience, a process I support if it's done legally. If they have concerns about what they believe to be discriminatory aspects of our laws, they are absolutely free not to come, and in the vast majority of cases retain full voting rights in their native countries. The 147 million people in the world who'd like to immigrate to the United States and the up-to-multi-decade green-card backlog suggests to me that the actual practical concerns about discriminatory public policy aren't very serious. The aliens themselves certainly don't think so.

Finally, there's the mutual-benefit argument, which suggests that if aliens are allowed to vote, then they can make common cause with other marginalized groups in our society, and come together for the mutual improvement of our country. This is a classic example of how identity politics erases individuals. Who is to say that a single male alien from Honduras has the same interests as, for example, a female high-school principal who is an American citizen in a low-income community? It is just as likely that they have competing interests. The Honduran might be a construction worker, and therefore might benefit from reduced taxes on the construction industry, while the principal might benefit from increased spending on education. The history of immigration and assimilation is littered with these types of examples.

Part of the reason that none of the stated arguments put forward by leftists hold up to logic is that, even when advancing the radical policy of noncitizen voting, they can't state their true view: that drawing a distinction between citizens and noncitizens of the United States is immoral. It's the same principle that leads them to oppose both securing the border with a wall and enacting effective immigration enforcement measures. But, in the same way that a strong border is what protects the citizens of the United States from drug trafficking and terrorism, a strong border between who is and is not a voting member of our Republic based on citizenship protects and upholds the legitimacy of our institutions. Opposing the radical position on noncitizen voting is certainly a worthy effort for conservatives.",728,nationalreview.com,The Left's Next Target: Noncitizen Voting | National Review
"""We've had multiple conversations over the last few months,"" both by phone and in person, Newsom said.

""I want to continue to have a relationship with the president on things that matter, and what matters is emergency preparedness, mitigation and suppression,"" the governor said. ""And that's an area that should be above politics, apolitical, and I just think that's critical and I want to stay in that space.""

The Los Angeles Times added:

Gov. Gavin Newsom's only encounter with President Trump during a two-day trip to Washington this week for the National Governors Assn. convention amounted to a quick handshake and brief chat. Instead, the Democratic governor invested time with top administration officials, hoping to smooth tense relations with the White House that could obstruct federal assistance in addressing critical issues facing California.

...

The governor said he had spoken to Trump on the telephone and that he had been cordial in person.

Newsom used his first ""State of the State"" address earlier this month to tackle Trump's border wall and immigration policies: ""This is our answer to the White House: No more division, no more xenophobia and no more nativism,"" he said. California followed up by leading 15 other states in challenging the president's national emergency declaration to build a barrier at the border.

But the governor also used his speech to cancel California's high-speed rail project. That led Trump to demand that the state return $3.5 billion in funding for high-speed rail, $1 billion of which has not been spent.

Newsom confirmed that Trump had brought up high-speed rail during their brief meeting in Washington, the Times reported.",729,Breitbart,Gavin Newsom: 'I Want to Continue to Have a Relationship' with Trump | Breitbart
"""You can see why she's one of the most disliked politicians in America. She's not nice. Her people are not nice,"" ex-Sanders spox Michael Briggs said in an interview with Politico regarding Clinton. ""[Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.""

""It doesn't make me feel good to feel this way but they're some of the biggest assholes in American politics,"" he added.

In a Monday report, Politico detailed how that after two years since Clinton and Sanders faced off against each other in the Democrat presidential primary, the Vermont Independent's air travel requests still rub members of Team Hillary the wrong way. According to the news outlet, Sanders's Gulfstream jet travel costed the Clinton campaign over $100,000. The 77-year-old lawmaker took three multi-day flights during the last two months of the election.

""I'm not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush DC office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,"" Zac Petkanas, Clinton's rapid response director, said.

Arianna Jones, Sanders's current spokeswoman, dismissed criticism of her boss's travel habits, saying it would have been difficult to attend campaign events in smaller towns without a charted jet.

""That's why chartered flights were used: to make sure Sen. Sanders could get to as many locations as quickly as possible in the effort to help the Democratic ticket defeat Donald Trump,"" argued Jones.

Sanders's private jet use is particularly curious as the far-left lawmaker has long warned against the so-called human contributions to climate change, even including elements of the Green New Deal in his 2016 platform.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ed Markey (D-MA) recently unveiled their version of the Green New Deal -- a proposal to ""transform"" the U.S. economy with a ""10-year national mobilization"" to shift away from fossil fuels and replace them with renewable energy sources.

"Over the last 15 or so years, the film business has changed forever, and not for the better. Nevertheless, Hollywood, California, is still the entertainment capital of the world. It's easy to lament the state of an industry that is either churning out $300 carnival rides (Marvel) or depressingly dull, pretentious indies (Roma) with a side order of increasingly tiring cheapie horror flicks, but name a country that does it better?

So you would think that with all of this talent and a full year to plan, Oscar night would not suck; that it would be the year's most exciting, moving, compelling, and memorable four hours of television. But as we all know, the exact opposite is true. The Oscars are excruciating to sit through and for that reason the ratings have plummeted to lows no one would have thought possible just a few years ago.

In fact, the ratings are so bad now, the backlash from the American people so severe, Oscar is celebrating the fact that Sunday night's telecast did not hit a new viewership low. You see, it was only the second worst low.

Whew, what a relief!

The Oscar telecast's existential problem is the format: Comedy monologue, award, acceptance speech, montage reel, award, acceptance speech, performance of song no one will remember in 12 hours, award, acceptance speech, death montage, award, and so on... The format is episodic, like an old variety show packed with pretentious speeches.

For years, though, Oscar did overcome this format and we did still tune in. The problem today is that all the fig leaves to overcome that format are gone.

Since 2014, the Oscars telecast has lost nearly a third of its audience -- a collapse from 43.7 million viewers to Sunday's 29.6 million. To anyone who lives outside the bubble, the reasons for this are obvious, and those reasons are now impossible to overcome...

People don't talk about this, primarily because those who would are part of the problem, but for years there has been a thriving cottage industry dedicated to tracking, predicting, and shaping the outcome of the Academy Awards. The Gold Derby forecast, that type of thing... And to their credit, they are good at what they do.

Unfortunately, they are so good, all we can look forward to is four hours of no surprises. We already know who is going to win. Sure, every once in a while there is an upset or two, but a couple of surprises over four hours is hardly worth the time.

Oscar night was a whole lot more fun when there was some actual suspense about the outcome.

And you can't avoid these predictions. They're everywhere now.

The argument is that Oscar night is Hollywood's night and therefore the stars should be allowed to express themselves in whatever way they wish.

Okay, but they are also inviting us into their home, and a polite host does not go out of his way to insult the guests.

So of course those of us who are tired of being insulted are turning down the invitation, are not tuning in. The show is already dull and predictable, why put ourselves through that?

And this will never, ever change. Hollywood is only becoming more insular and politicized, more obnoxiously woke, more willing to disguise its own intolerance and bullying behind a shield of virtue.

In the time it takes to watch the Oscars, I can watch The Green Berets and The Outlaw Josey Wales. This is not a difficult choice.

And if you were a normal American looking to give Sunday night's telecast a shot, it opened with a Trump joke. Click.

One of the pleasures of Oscar night used to be the promise of spending four hours with the host, someone you liked, a Johnny Carson or Billy Crystal or Steve Martin. In the old days, it was Bob Hope. These gentleman promised a fun night. They were worth your time.

What's more, these are hosts in possession of something that is all but dead in today's hyper-politicized world: universal appeal.

Kevin Hart would have been a great choice to host Sunday's telecast, he is one of the few entertainers left with universal appeal, someone who has not gone out of his way to polarize his talent with nasty name calling and insulting political statements -- and look what happened to him: under the guise of a few innocuous gay jokes, he was blacklisted from hosting. But those jokes were just an excuse. Alec Baldwin and Joy Reid have actually said truly terrible things are homosexuals. Both remain in good stead with the very same people who sought Hart's destruction.

Hart's real sin is that he's not political, and if you are not political in today's Orwellian climate, you are suspect. Look at the pressure put on Taylor Swift to come out as a left-winger.

There's talk of Dwayne Johnson hosting next year's telecast. Hey, everyone likes The Rock, but hosting a four hour show is not his thing, he's not even a comedian. No thanks.

The aura of the movie star overcomes all, and there just aren't that many movie stars anymore.

Look at how Sunday's telecast opened -- with Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Maya Rudolph. As I asked Monday, why in the world would a show devoted to the magic of filmmaking open with three TV stars?

Sure, they've made movies, but they are and always will be TV stars.

This isn't even about politics. You can hate on Jane Fonda all you want, but Jane Fonda is pure movie star, as are other hardcore lefties like Shirley MacLaine, Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Richard Dreyfus, and the like. Regardless of their politics, there is something about them that is inexplicable, something no one else has, and tuning into the Oscars used to be about spending four hours with gods, with Jack Nicholson, Vanessa Redgrave, Clint Eastwood, Sidney Poitier, Sean Connery, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Dustin Hoffman, Michael Douglas, Diane Keaton... I could go on and on forever.

Awkwafina? Trevor Noah? Dana Carvey? Emilia Clarke? Sure, Sunday night had its moment. Julia Roberts was there, so was Helen Mirren, Michelle Yeoh, Michael B. Jordan, Barbra Streisand... But again, are a mere handful of legitimate movie star appearances worth four painfully predictable hours of charisma-free mediocrity and insults?",731,Breitbart,Nolte: 4 Reasons the Oscars Are Broken Forever
"Damon Linker does a good job criticizing the American impulse to ""do something"" in Venezuela:

What happens inside Venezuela simply isn't our responsibility. The question that cries out for an answer is why so many Americans conclude otherwise.

The usual answer is that many Americans assume that we are obligated to meddle in the affairs of other countries because our government claims the mantle of ""global leadership"" for itself. The U.S. reserves the right to interfere in other states' internal politics because that ""leadership"" is defined as intrusively and broadly as possible. The Americans that buy into this ""leadership"" role then convince themselves that the U.S. has to meddle in each new crisis that comes along because ""failure"" to meddle will be perceived as an ""abdication"" of our leading role. Having assigned itself the task of serving as the arbitrary planetary overseer, our government has defined minding its own business as minding the business of every country in the world to one degree or another.

That's not a bad explanation as far as it goes, but it may be missing something. A better answer might be that it has become a deeply ingrained habit from decades of practice during the Cold War and the post-9/11 era, and that habit has then turned into an addiction. Many Americans are now so accustomed to having their government interfere in other countries' affairs that they have come to expect it and eventually to demand it when it isn't immediately forthcoming. It has become such a common practice that our leaders routinely define ""who we are"" as a nation by our willingness to meddle in the affairs of others. As a result, many of us have been conditioned to fault the president if he ""fails"" to interfere. The two most enduring conventional criticisms of Obama's foreign policy have had nothing to do with his illegal wars or his indefensible policy in Yemen, but have focused instead of Obama's supposed ""failure"" to support Green movement protesters in 2009 and his ""failure"" to bomb Syrian government forces in 2013. Most politicians and pundits are much more eager to drag a president for supposed ""inaction"" than they are willing to criticize the most reckless and ill-considered actions. That creates the perverse political incentives that allow ""do somethingism"" to flourish.

Presidents no longer have to justify why another country's internal disputes are our responsibility before taking sides in those disputes. It is simply taken for granted that they must be, and it is left to the president's relatively small number of non-interventionist critics to make the case that they aren't.",732,The American Conservative,Our Foreign Meddling Addiction
"Colin Kaepernick's lawyers have issued a statement saying their client and the National Football league have resolved their grievances.

Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has reportedly had conversations with XFL executives about joining the rebooted league when it launches in 2020.

An XFL official confirmed the conversations to the Sporting News on Monday, but didn't give any details about what type of offer could lure Kaepernick to the league.

XFL NOT LIMITING ITSELF TO NFL'S DRAFT ELIGIBILITY RULES AS YOUNG STARS RISE IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL

The report comes on the heels of Kaepernick reportedly seeking a $20 million contract to play in the Alliance of American Football. Sources told the Sporting News he was seeking the same amount of money to play in Vince McMahon's football league as well.

The XFL is seen as a direct competitor to the AAF, so it would make some sense for the league to make a splash with a signing like Kaepernick. Though McMahon has said politics would not be injected into the league and that each player has to stand for the national anthem, ESPN reported in March 2017 that Kaepernick would stand for the anthem if given a chance to play in the NFL. Kaepernick later downplayed that report in a tweet, and it's not clear if he'd stand for a non-NFL entity.

Kaepernick's lawyer Mark Geragos has previously hinted the New England Patriots or Oakland Raiders would be interested in signing him. But there has been no confirmed interest in him.

The XFL hasn't announced any big names to join the league, despite rumors it would allow a young college football star like Trevor Lawrence to play and undercut the NFL's draft entry policy.

"Abortion survivor reacts to Senate failing to pass bill protecting babies born alive in failed abortions

Abortion survivor Melissa Ohden blasted Senate Democrats for voting down a bill that would have threatened prison time for doctors who don't attempt to save the life of infants born alive after a failed abortion: ""I'm living proof this is necessary.""

Ohden, the founder of the Abortion Survivors Network, has said she was ""accidentally born alive"" after a saline-infused abortion. She met with Senators prior to the Monday night vote and was outside the chamber doors when the votes were cast against the bill, The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.

DEMS BLOCK 'BORN ALIVE' BILL TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE TO INFANTS WHO SURVIVE FAILED ABORTIONS

""I was disappointed,"" Ohden told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning, ""but I'm certainly not surprised. The Democrats who voted last night against this bill really showed us that they're willing to sacrifice lives like mine to keep abortion-on-demand right there.""

She added that it's unfortunate to see pro-abortion legislation sweep across the nation as Democrats blocked the bill.

""No child should have their lives left in the hands of the abortionist or a medical professional to somehow decide to provide them medical care,"" Ohden said. ""We need this bill, not only to ensure we're provided medical care, but that there's penalty for when there's failure to do so.""

ABORTION SURVIVORS ON NEW LATE-TERM ABORTION BILLS: 'WHERE WERE MY RIGHTS IN THE WOMB?'

Ohden remains hopeful despite the bill dying.

""We're going to continue to see bills like this introduced, and I have great hope because we have great Republican legislators who are committed to life, the president is so committed to life, and really our nation is full of people who identify as being pro-life and are wanting to do something about it.""

President Trump agreed said Monday ""will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress.""

""Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children,"" Trump wrote. ""The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies AFTER birth.""

All prominent Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls in the Senate voted down the measure, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The final vote was 53-44 to end Democratic-delaying tactics -- seven votes short of the 60 needed.

Three Democrats joined Republicans to support the bill -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Doug Jones or Alabama. Three Republicans did not vote, apparently because of scheduling issues and plane flight delays -- including Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tim Scott of South Carolina.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., the bill's sponsor, told ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" Monday night that each opponent ""constantly"" lied with ""blatant nonsense"" claiming the bill ""would end abortion,"" when in reality ""this shouldn't be about politics...this should be about having heart.""

The legislation was introduced after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, appeared to endorse post-birth abortions while discussing The Repeal Act, a state bill which sought to repeal restrictions on third-trimester abortions:

""If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,"" he said. ""The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable.

""Is Warren right that access to candidates is for sale?"" Wallace asked, referencing Senator Elizabeth Warren's (D., Mass.) pledge not to provide more access to high-dollar donors.

""No, but I think you do need to get money out of politics,"" Gillibrand responded. ""The most important thing we have to do is upend the way our democracy functions. Today, the wealthiest, most powerful lobbyists and special interest groups get to write bills in the dead of night ... So when you write a bill in Medicare part D, and say, 'Medicare, they can't buy in bulk and get the cheapest prices for drugs.'

Gillibrand went on to describe the Pfizer executive who is hosting the event as a ""dear friend,"" who believes strongly in her advocacy for women and the LGBTQ community. The executive in question, Sally Susman, serves as Pfizer's executive vice president and chief corporate affairs officer, according to CNBC. Susman is considered a major Democratic donor and bundled between $200,000 and $500,000 for President Barack Obama in 2012, according to OpenSecrets.

"President Trump heads to Hanoi, Vietnam to meet with North Korea's leader; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel.

The expectations for President Trump are a lot higher as he meets with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un for their second summit, argued Democratic strategist Leslie Marshall.

The president and Kim are scheduled to have a two-day summit in Hanoi, Vietnam in hopes to have North Korea denuclearize and pursue peace in the Korean peninsula.

HANOI POSTCARD: KIM-TRUMP SUMMIT INSPIRES ENTREPRENEURS

During the Fox News ""Special Report All-Star Panel,"" Marshall, Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt, and ""The Next Revolution"" host Steve Hilton weighed in on the political stakes for Trump amid the summit.

Marshall told the panel that the ""dealmaker"" had a ""good photo op and a bump in the polls"" after the 2018 summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, but that ""we can't have that this time around"" and predicted that this summit will only be a repeat.

""Dan Coats said, and I agree with him 100 percent, that Kim Jong Un needs to have the WMDs. That is his security blanket,"" Marshall said. ""Unless we are hard and push on full denuclearization, we are not taking baby steps toward our goal because in a sense, in this regard, Kim Jong Un is holding the cards and we're not getting anywhere. What kind of a deal do we have? Really nothing and I fear that we will have that again.""

Steve Hilton expressed a bit more optimism, saying that the ""process is the purpose"" and that the fact that both nations are talking is a ""positive result.""

""If any other president, whether Republican or Democrat, had got to this point by first getting China to participate in the pressure campaign and then to really reboot this relationship so that we're talking rather than being on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe, they'd be hailed as a foreign policy genius,"" Hilton argued.

Meanwhile, Stirewalt insisted that ""time"" was always on the side of the North Koreans and that part of this week's summit is to entice Kim Jong Un with Vietnam's thriving economy.

""The president's promise to Kim is always, 'C'mon, play ball with me and you're gonna end up rich, your country's gonna end up rich, and you're gonna see quick growth.'

"Modern day liberalism is all about 'me'; director Spike Lee uses Oscars win to go on political rant.

What does Spike Lee, AOC, Jussie Smollett and ill-mannered teens tell us about modern day liberalism? Answer: A heck of a lot.

Now let's start with Spike Lee. The iconic director is worth millions. I mean, he's made millions, he's done really well. Over 30 years, though, he's been nominated no fewer than five times for an Academy award. Until Sunday night, he had never won an Oscar. He took home the award for adapting the screenplay for his movie ""BlacKkKlansman. ""

But rather than showing humility and gratitude, he spiked the moment with a tiresome political diatribe that he fumbled.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LAURA INGRAHAM.

""The 2020 Presidential election is around the corner. Let's all - let's all be on the right side of history,"" he said. ""Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let's do the right thing. You know, I had to get that in there.""

Number one: Lame that after all these years, he couldn't memorize his lines. Number two: Lame that he couldn't accept the honor without gratuitous cursing, which you couldn't even hear because the Oscars had to bleep him. Number three: Disagreeing with your political vision, Spike, doesn't make you immoral or a bad person.

Well, like I've said before, liberals are angry sometimes even when they should be happy. And most are off-the-charts intolerant and judgmental of people who don't think like they do. And Lee, just like in his latest film, suffers from kind of a deficit of both subtlety and grace.

Perhaps not surprisingly, President Trump couldn't resist lobbing a post-Oscars response, tweeting, ""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African-Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts, etc.) than almost any other Pres!""

Well, beyond the politics what should not have been a part of Hollywood's big night anyway, Spike Lee's performance lacks some grace. I think, to regular people, he just came across as kind of bratty, rude, self-absorbed, egotist, masquerading, though, as a brilliant social justice warrior. The old Spike Lee -- got to go back like 30-35 years -- was at least kind of cutting edge.

Like most of today's social justice warriors, AOC truly believes she is always morally right. And that notion entitles her to be one of the leaders of not the #MeToo movement, but the ""Me-me-me"" movement. She's been on the job for exactly two months and you would swear her Green New Deal is a second Declaration of Independence.

This craziness goes way beyond Spike Lee. It's the same arrogant, self-important thinking that propelled ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett into believing he could stage an anti-MAGA hoax and then conclude that he emerges a hero. Making a scene and casting yourself as a wounded martyr is what these elites do best. You see, when you're on the right side of history, it's your duty to start a national conversation and inject yourself in the middle of it. Facts? They're irrelevant, kind of passe. The famed political philosopher Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once observed, ""There's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually and semantically correct in about being morally right.""

Well, like most of today's social justice warriors, AOC truly believes she is always morally right. And that notion entitles her to be one of the leaders of not the #MeToo movement, but the ""Me-me-me"" movement. She's been on the job for exactly two months and you would swear her Green New Deal is a second Declaration of Independence.

""I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks ago and it's creating all of this conversation,"" AOC said recently. ""Why? Because no one else has even tried. So people are, like, oh, it's unrealistic. Oh, it's vague. Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing. and I'm, like, you try. You do it. Because you're not. Because you're not. So until you do it, I'm the boss. How about that?""

I know you didn't. I mean, she's like, 25-29 years old, and she's, like, the boss of Congress. And it's, like, totally -- it must be nice.

But what she lacks in experience, she's excited. It's kind of good she's in there, in the mix. She lacks kind of its perspective, too. She makes up for all of it in ego and confidence, got to give her that.

Well, Ocasio-Cortez's allergy to protocol, combined with her ""I want it now"" mentality is a by-product of the ""everyone gets a trophy"" era in which she was raised. Where coddled kids grow up to be entitled adults.

Who needs manners and decorum when you've just been rewarded for speaking your truth? You always have to hit your chest when you say you're speaking your truth, whenever and wherever you want. When adults indulge youngsters, we get shallow thinkers. And by the way, this entire notion of speaking your truth is goofy because it presupposes that there really is no objective truth.

Your truth isn't necessarily the truth, and it's probably just your opinion. And you're entitled to have it. But until you've lived, fallen and failed, it's probably fairly uninformed, even if it's entertaining and highly energetic. You're entitled to speak all you'd like, of course --it's the First Amendment. Everybody is entitled to an opinion, but no one is obligated to listen to you.

And whether you're an overrated director or minor TV actor or Vogue's congressional ""It"" girl, none of it matters. And that goes, by the way, for rude middle school and high school students who are coached to get in the face of adults on Capitol Hill and just like talk to them like they are the contemporaries or Instagram buddies.

What am I talking about? Well on Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein was confronted by a group of AOC mini-mes lobbying for the Green New Deal match in her office. This may have been Feinstein's finest hour. She was forced to deal with immature, militant activists that her party is churning out by the thousands -- activists who usually confront and then try to embarrass Republicans.

Again, the blame isn't with the kids; they're students. It's with their parents and teachers. Let's face it, if there were no cell phones recording every word, how many would have even been there? So many people today, they crave attention. They want to have their moment. I understand.

"Tucker: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the leader of the Democratic party

Republicans have described Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as the leader of her party, the boss of the Democratic Party. And there's a reason that they are saying that -- because she is. She said so herself while discussing her budget-busting ""Green New Deal"" in an interview on Friday.

So, they arrive in Washington in January, and they have no idea what to do. Lucky for them, someone had a plan. She was a 29-year-old bartender from the Bronx, and she showed up with a brand new Democratic platform already written. She imposed her Green New Deal on her party.

And in less than two months, Ocasio-Cortez has basically convinced the entire leadership of the Democratic Party to buy into this plan, to ratify it. It's a perfect plan. It would shut down the entire American economy, except for the hedge funds that fund Democratic campaigns. Absolutely perfect.

It's a measure of how cowardly impassive everyone has become all of a sudden that a chorus of right-thinking Democrats hasn't told this idiotic windbag to be quiet and take a seat. Don't talk until you learn something. But of course nobody has done that they are all too afraid of her.

There is only one downside. The plan, if enacted would cost, some estimate, more than the entire global GDP. Not the gross domestic product of the United States, but the GDP of the world.

It's pretty expensive. But it doesn't bother Ocasio-Cortez at all. She doesn't care. This is how she described her reaction to the bean counters' description of this as ""too expensive.""

My gosh. It's a measure of how cowardly impassive everyone has become all of a sudden that a chorus of right-thinking Democrats hasn't told this idiotic windbag to be quiet and take a seat. Don't talk until you learn something. But of course nobody has done that they are all too afraid of her.

What you are watching isn't politics. It's a children's crusade, an army of tiny combatants marching off in oversized clothes into an unknown, puffed up with ignorant self-righteousness. Last week, as if on cue, activists showed up with a group of kids to harass California Sen. Dianne Feinstein for the crime of not endorsing the Green New Deal.

You almost -- almost -- had to feel a little bad for Dianne Feinstein. This is not the politics that she joined. When Feinstein became a U.S. senator 27 years ago, the Democratic Party was still sort of tethered to reality. They cared about the middle class --or said they did. They wanted a secure border. Feinstein made that case herself. They said they wanted abortion to be legal, but at least they also wanted it to be rare. They never told you not to have children.

Dianne Feinstein is 85 now. She is not the future of the Democratic Party. Comrade Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the future. She may be arrogant and dumb, but on one point, she is absolutely right. She is the boss.",738,Fox News,"Tucker Carlson: How dumb, arrogant Ocasio-Cortez became the boss of the Democratic Party"
"A new consensus is emerging, and it sounds a lot like what the president has said all along.

Read recent essays on China. Visit think-tank public symposia. Hear out military analysts. Talk with academics and media pundits. Listen to Silicon Valley grandees. Watch Senate speeches and politicians interview on television.

The resulting new groupspeak is surreal. If one excises the word ""Trump,"" what follows is a seemingly revolutionary recalibration of attitudes toward China that more or less echo Trump's voice in the wilderness and often crude and shrill warnings dating back from the campaign trail of 2015.

Trump's second secretary of state, the skillful Mike Pompeo, has been institutionalizing the president's pessimistic view of China. Insightful but heretofore underappreciated assessments from China scholars such as Miles Yu and Gordon Chang are now being taking seriously. Both have been warning us for years that the Chinese seek domination, not accommodation, and are replacing their erstwhile feigned respect for our strength with an emboldened contempt for our perceived growing weakness, whether real or psychological. Both have warned also that once China achieves military, economic, and cultural parity with the United States, the global order will be quite different from that of the last 75 years.

From the military, one hears more frequently now that we were at a tipping point by late 2016: The Obama Asian pivot had failed -- publicly provocative, but in reality without substance, giving the lethal impression of real weakness masked by empty rhetoric. The Chinese militarization of the Spratley Islands was conceded as the inevitable future of the South China Sea. Chinese military and weapons doctrine was aimed at destroying the offensive capability of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific as a way of breaking off allies from America, and then Finlanding them.

From 2009 to 2016, our defense readiness was eroding, China's increasing. Psychologically, the American military could not reassure the global order that China would not one day soon unleash North Korea, absorb Taiwan, emasculate South Korea and Japan, or isolate the Philippines and Australia. Huge and mercantile Chinese trade surpluses with all its Western trading partners were accepted as normal.

The cash-short Pentagon seemed to shrug that America was the victim of cosmic and historic forces that inevitably would dethrone the United States, analogous to the declinism of the 1930s, when a powerful U.S. 7th Fleet was not able to deter a modern rising Japanese navy from carving out what would become the Greater Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on perceptions of American impotence and weariness and spent European colonialism.

In Silicon Valley, the good old news of making trillions of dollars over the last 30 years in outsourcing assemblage to China, opening up a huge new Chinese consumer market, and entering joint partnerships has insidiously been eclipsed by the growing reality that our techie masters of the universe were instead deluded Dr. Frankensteins who had helped to birth an unstoppable monster.

Technology was stolen, either by espionage inside the U.S. or by formalized theft as the cost of doing business inside China. Copyrights and patents did not bother China. The scale of environmental damage inside China did not diminish, but accelerated and was manifested abroad. There was no sense of symmetry; in dealing with China, the idea of commercial reciprocity, shared environmental protocols, generalized notions of international commerce -- all that simply did not exist. And the reason it did not exist wasn't sloppiness or insensitivity; it did not exist by design, owing to the Chinese's arrogance that they were the rising sun and the U.S. was in its twilight -- with a few exceptions granted to some of the Western elite who were getting rich largely by accommodating the Chinese warping of trade and technological theft.

Financially challenged colleges and universities had come to rely on full-tuition-paying Chinese students. When stories spread that some Chinese students were acting as organs of the Chinese Communist Party, actively engaging in espionage, or illiberally bullying any critics of China, colleges either ignored such news or regarded its bearers as racists and xenophobes.

Chinese college students who mouthed government talking points were strangely rebranded, in identity-politics fashion, as the victimized Other, and to be accorded the usual accruing exemptions. In sum, China was considered a politically correct entity. Or better yet, it was seen as a cash cow for struggling liberal-arts colleges and so properly immune from any suggestion that it sent thousands of its citizens abroad to absorb or expropriate Western technology without contamination from taboo liberal ideas. While the U.S. obsessed over ""Russian collusion"" from a thuggish but comparative weak Vladimir Putin, no one worried much about the increasingly boldness of Chinese espionage and cyber sabotage. In Tolkienesque terms of relative threats, Putin played Saruman to a Chinese Sauron.

This willful blindness was similar again to the denseness of Europe and the United States from 1880 to 1920, when Japan had sent tens of thousands of students and liaisons abroad to learn everything from nautical and aviation engineering to assembly-line fabrication and sophisticated steel production. The West, in condescending and racist fashion, was flattered: Such emulation must be proof of Japan's inferiority and desires to become a Westernized (albeit junior) free-market democracy.

In fact, Japanese expropriation was done in a context of arrogance and bitterness over not receiving commensurate recognition after World War I. Japan assumed that whatever was stolen from the West could be improved by superior Japanese discipline, order, and national unity and purpose -- far better craftsmanship without the drag of research-and-development costs.

Our diplomats for decades had assured Americans that Chinese trade imbalances, technological theft, gratuitous bullying in the air and sea, disdain for U.S. Asian allies, rampant espionage, and contempt for the postwar commercial order were 50-year-old ""growing pains"" -- the Tiananmen Square road bumps on the inevitable path to liberal society and consensual government.

The arrogant Western idea was that just as free-market economics (rather than jaded mercantilism, dictatorship, and government monopolies) had enriched the Chinese, so too would the accruing bounty ""liberalize"" Chinese society, ensure an ""aware"" consumer class, and impress on the country that Western popular culture and politics were just as inevitable and attractive as had been Western profit-making. Or economists and investors insisted that cheap imported Chinese goods meant that the stagnant wages of the middle classes would not matter so much at Walmart -- while American business would be forced to be leaner and more efficient to survive the cutthroat competition.

The net result was to ignore or contextualize China's civil-rights abuses, contaminated products, religious persecution, flagrant international aggression, attacks on the postwar global order, neo-colonialism, and abject racism on the grounds these sins were comparable to our own 19th-century bouts with such illiberality -- or in some perverse way in the long run even beneficial to the United States.

Again, American finance and corporations invested full bore in Chinese joint projects, offshored, and outsourced -- often at the price of giving away key American technological and strategic advantages, hollowing out American red-state industrial and manufacturing capacity, and weakening the nation's cyber and conventional military security.

The idea seemed to be that if a few thousand multimillionaires got even far more fabulously rich by acquiescing to Chinese mercantilism, they could not do real harm to the vast and powerful U.S. Or perhaps, given inevitable American decline, the idea was that they should get their profits in now, before the American golden goose was put out of its misery.

In all these areas and more, a new consensus, among left and right, is now settling in that we are at a crossroads with China. Any more appeasement and acquiescence will lose the West its Asian allies, who will be forced to go with the ascendant superpower, not the declining one.

Either the U.S. military recalibrates or it will return to its 1930s stature of a powerful but vastly overextended Pacific navy and air force. We have reached a cultural nexus at which any more acquiescence would institutionalize the idea that to object to Chinese piracy is to indulge in hurtful stereotypes and therefore should be replaced with appeasement, and that giving away American technology or allowing its expropriation with a wink and nod is not treasonous but simply good business.

The establishment would like to fool itself that it came to its growing about-face on China thanks to a natural exhaustion of patience, or new data, or brilliant new exegeses. And that evolution may be in part true.

But far more likely, Trump's early and relentless hammering on Chinese mercantilism, systematic cheating, and illiberality finally made the old status quo unsustainable in the face of mounting evidence.

The establishment is adopting Trump's once-renegade stance toward China, and yet trying to immunize it from him all the same. So the end result seems something like the following: ""That idiot Trump somehow now agrees with us on confronting China.""",739,nationalreview.com,The Establishment Goes Trump on China | National Review
"GREEN NEW DEAL COULD COST A LOT OF GREEN: The sweeping ""Green New Deal"" proposed by Rep.

STAGE SET IN VIETNAM FOR SECOND TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived by armored train at Vietnam's Dong Dang railway station on the China-Vietnam border on Tuesday for his second nuclear summit with President Trump ... The president was flying to Hanoi from Washington and was scheduled to. Press reports speculate that Kim will be driven to Hanoi ahead of his Wednesday meeting with Trump. Security is tight in Vietnam as officials scramble to finish preparations for a rushed two-day summit that's meant to deal with one of Asia's biggest security challenges: North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear program that stands on the verge of viably threatening any target on the planet. Officials shared no details about the specifics of a summit. Pundits are skeptical that Kim will give up any nukes, but there was a palpable, carnival-like excitement among many in Hanoi as the final preparations were made.

"The Senate is currently debating the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on the floor and will vote on the legislation later this evening. The bill, sponsored by Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) requires that doctors provide medical care to infants born alive after attempted abortion procedures.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell opened the session, saying of the bill, ""It isn't about restrictions on abortion. It isn't about changing the options available to women. It's just about recognizing that a newborn baby is a newborn baby, period.""

""Can the extreme far-left politics surrounding abortion really have come this far?"" McConnell added. ""Are we really supposed to think that it's normal that there are now two sides debating whether a newborn, whether newborn living babies deserve medical attention?""

Shortly after McConnell's remarks, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on the Senate floor that the born-alive bill ""is carefully crafted to target, intimidate, and shut down reproductive health care providers."" He also claimed the bill ""would impose requirements on what type of care doctors must provide in certain circumstances, even if that care is ineffective, contradictory to medical evidence, and against the family's wishes.""

In fact, the bill doesn't mandate any particular type of care for infants, and the medical specifics are left up to the judgment of the physician in each case. Instead, it enacts a requirement that newborns delivered in the context of abortion be afforded ""the same degree"" of care that ""any other child born alive at the same gestational age"" would receive.

""I urge the American people, do you own research. Read the bill. See what it says,"" Schumer added later.

In a response to the Senate minority leader, Sasse delivered remarks on the floor and encouraged his Democratic colleagues to bring the bill to the floor and show where in the text it limits abortion in any way.

""This language is too blunt for many people in this body,"" Sasse said. ""Infanticide is what the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is actually about. Are we a country that protects babies that are born alive, outside the womb, after surviving a botched abortion? . . . This bill is not actually about anything that limits abortion.""",741,nationalreview.com,Schumer Lies about Infanticide Ban in Remarks on Senate Floor | National Review
"But a host of Trump Administration policies threaten to tear Congressional Republicans apart on a variety of domestic and foreign subjects.

We'll wonder what Paul George might say.

GOPers have increasingly exercised independence from the party orthodoxy and President Trump over the past few months. A number of Republicans have bucked the President and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) - in both statements and roll call votes on the Senate floor. Consider the positions some Republicans staked out on Mr. Trump's plan for a hasty withdrawal from Syria.

A repeal of some sanctions on Russia; how the President handled Saudi Arabia after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi; whether the administration complied with the Magnitsky Act when it comes to disciplining those responsible for Khashoggi's death; the President's decision to declare a national emergency to go over the heads of lawmakers and shift Congressionally-targeted spending for his border wall. There are also GOP disagreements over trade and North Korea.

But the biggest GOP fissures could materialize once everyone digests what was said both in public and private by former presidential confidante Michael Cohen. Cohen's spending most of the week sitting before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight Committee and House Intelligence Committee. Certainly many Trump loyalists will form a rearguard around the President. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, have long protested the public Cohen hearing on Wednesday. They've derided it as a media circus and questioned the motives of Democrats scheduling the hearing.

Lawmakers from both sides will certainly find plenty of nuggets to mine to justify their positions on Cohen. But never before in the Trump presidency has a figure with ties so close to the commander in chief himself - let alone someone who is going to jail soon - testified at a Congressional hearing. There have been appearances by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. But Cohen's testimony trifecta is different in context and scope. President Trump will certainly try to contour the Cohen narrative among his followers.

The outcomes from big hearings like the Cohen forum are always unpredictable. Look back to 1986 and the Iran-Contra hearings. Iran-Contra may have been the most-seminal set of hearings peering into the actions of an administration since Watergate. The Cohen sessions might not quite go that deep. But they hold the potential to provide a grand picture window into the Trump Administration.

The Iran-Contra hearings prompted no impeachment proceedings against President Reagan (as some was a distinct possibility at the time). Many Americans also were sympathetic to the conduct of Oliver North, the star witness of the hearings. There was a thought going into the hearings that lawmakers would pillory North.

We have no sense of how viewers of the Cohen forum may perceive him or interpret the actions of President Trump. But there's always the chance that information which spills out during the sessions could actually bolster the President's standing.

Congressional Democrats may not face the same divisive chasms as Republicans when it comes to the President. The first problem for GOPers is that Mr. Trump is in fact a Republican - and many Republicans on Capitol Hill remain wary of his conduct. However, there will inevitably be some Democrats who will use the Cohen appearances as a fulcrum to push for impeachment and the possible discipline of other administration officials.

Going to the mat with the President is great politics in the most-liberal of districts. But it's a problem for moderate to conservative Democrats who represent districts or states where President Trump remains popular. Even some Democrats who hold nothing but contempt for the President are reluctant to go for broke. There's concern that Democrats don't want to overplay their hand. Others are just unwilling to wrestle with an issue as nettlesome as challenging President Trump and would prefer to focus on lower-hanging fruit and policy issues.

Then you have Democratic presidential hopefuls like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)m Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and possible candidate Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). Will they all try to one-up each other on taking on the President? Or will some try to temper their message?

This is a challenge. After all, they are all running for President because they don't want President Trump to return to the White House in 2021. The threats to rip apart Democrats aren't quite in the same territory as Zion Williamson's footwear. But the divides are distinct.

Either way, the next few days with Cohen on Capitol Hill could be crucial to understanding the direction of both parties as they cruise toward 2020. Congressional commentary and reactions to Cohen's testimony could offer more clues on the state of politics than roll call votes to overturn a national emergency over the border wall or where lawmakers stand on the Magnitsky Act.

Democrats are already waging their own internecine battles. Consider how Democrats are tussling with one another over the Green New Deal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is now lighting up Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for how she handled student activists who came to her office last week. Those are internal skirmishes. But properly addressing Cohen and his testimony requires more nuance and political savvy. Is this just a partisan point-scoring exercise? Or will information revealed in the sessions represent bona fide problems worthy of the most-serious scrutiny imaginable?

An outsider might suggest that both parties tread lightly. But that's not usually the way these hearings go down. Lawmakers all wield agendas, predicated on the demands of their districts and states. That's to say nothing of the penchant of some to secure a headline or a viral video clip on YouTube. Those at the margins may likely capture most of the attention. But the noise doesn't necessarily reflect internal tiffs. That's where the seams are stressed and tearing. And if either the Democrats or Republicans slash across the top of the key too hard, they're likely to find themselves sprawled across the court, just like Zion Williamson.",742,Fox News,Cohen on Capitol Hill could be crucial to understanding the direction of both parties before 2020
"Why Bernie Sanders faces an uphill climb to the Democratic presidential nomination

Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign spokesman unloaded on Hillary Clinton and her team on Monday, calling them the ""biggest a--holes in American politics,"" after former members of Clinton's campaign leaked details this week about Sanders' use of private jets to attend campaign rallies on her behalf.

Speaking to Politico, the spokesman, Michael Briggs, proceeded to call Clinton's staff ""total ingrates,"" given that Sanders claims he billed the Clinton-Kaine campaign for private air travel in order to attend events that he otherwise would have needed to skip.

""You can see why she's one of the most disliked politicians in America,"" Briggs said, referring to Clinton. ""She's not nice. Her people are not nice. [Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.""

Briggs added: ""It doesn't make me feel good to feel this way but they're some of the biggest a--holes in American politics.""

""She's not nice. Her people are not nice.""

-- Bernie Sanders 2016 spokesman Michael Briggs

FIVE THINGS BERNIE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT SOCIALISM

Several former Clinton staffers, also speaking to Politico, reported that Sanders' frequent requests for private planes from the campaign became ""a running joke in the office"" -- in part because Sanders is a socialist, and also because he has pushed for the elimination of carbon-generating heavy aircraft in favor of high-speed rail networks. In all, Sanders reportedly billed the Clinton-Kaine campaign approximately $100,000 for air travel.

Some bad blood remains between the Clinton and Sanders camp, according to insiders, in part because of Sanders' harsh criticisms of Clinton during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.

Talking to the liberal ""Pod Save America"" podcast in 2017, Clinton said she ""couldn't believe"" that, because of Sanders, she was forced into ""basically defending President Obama in a Democratic primary."" And in her book, the election retrospective ""What Happened,"" Clinton slammed Sanders' ideas as unrealistic and decried him for using ""innuendo and impugning my character"" such that she suffered ""lasting damage"" into the general election.

GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD COST UP TO $92 TRILLION, STUDY SAYS -- THAT'S APPROX. $600G PER HOUSEHOLD

Sanders spokesperson Arianna Jones, though, maintained that Sanders put everything he had into helping Clinton once she had secured the Democratic nomination. Jones said it was physically impossible for Sanders to get to all of the Clinton event locations in such a short period of time without chartered flights, especially since the senator was traveling to many smaller markets with limited commercial air travel options.

""That's why chartered flights were used: to make sure Sen. Sanders could get to as many locations as quickly as possible in the effort to help the Democratic ticket defeat Donald Trump,"" Sanders spokeswoman Arianna Jones told Politico. ""Sen. Sanders campaigned so aggressively for Secretary Clinton, at such a grueling pace, it became a story unto itself, setting the model for how a former opponent can support a nominee in a general election.""

Jones reported that in the three months prior to the November 2016 election, Sanders supported Clinton by attending 39 rallies in 13 states.

Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in 2016 with his spirited challenge to Clinton, and his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the era of President Trump.

Sanders' campaign said earlier this month that he raised more than $4 million in the 12 hours since announcing his 2020 presidential bid. Previously, the biggest first-day fundraiser in the race had been California Sen. Kamala Harris, who raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign. And this week, Sanders announced he has already signed up a historic 1 million volunteers.

The question now for Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democrats who embrace many of his policy ideas and who are newer to the national political stage -- and whether Sanders can survive with the evident lingering resentment from members of the Democratic Party establishment.

""Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump,"" the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist said in an email to supporters announcing his srun. ""Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.""

As for whether Sanders -- who has pushed for the Green New Deal, which would strive to greatly reduce air travel -- would be flying commercial for upcoming campaign trips this year, Jones told Politico he ""will be flying commercial whenever possible,"" and that the ""campaign will consider the use of charter flights based on a variety of factors, including security requirements, logistics, and media interest in traveling with the senator.""

Also causing headaches for Sanders' socialist, penny-pinching image: His high-end income and multiple houses. Notably, he owns three houses. In 2016, he bought a $575,000 four-bedroom lake-front home in his home state. This is in addition to a row house in Washington D.C., as well as a house in Burlington, Vermont.

"Marlow's talk with Gorka aired on February 11's edition of America First.

""Actually, as we're recording this, this would've been his 50th birthday,"" said Marlow. ""It's kind of amazing, because he's been gone almost seven years, but his legacy is indelible.""

Marlow said Breitbart identified how ""culture [is] upstream from politics,"" and how conservatives must ""take back the media,"" including the ""entertainment world and academia.""

Marlow recalled a lesson learned from Breitbart: ""You're not supposed to have cocktails with the folks in the establishment media. You're not supposed to share a milkshake with two straws with them. You're supposed to be at war with them.""

After attending what he described as a ""decidedly left-wing [preparatory] school,"" Marlow recalled his political genesis as a listener of conservative talk radio. He then recalled his ""first gig"" with talk radio host Larry Elder.

Breitbart spoke of the primacy of culture in shaping politics at a 2007 Young America's Foundation (YAF) event in Santa Barbara, CA, where he first met Marlow:

Andrew grew up as a default factory setting liberal in Los Angeles. [Andrew Breitbart] was saying, 'I'm pretty sure Hollywood is controlling everything, right now.' He kind of predicted Barack Obama. He kind of saw that the Hollywood crowd was going to anoint someone. A made-for-TV presidency. Does that ring a bell for any Trump fans, out there? Andrew said it's going to be a made-for-TV presidency, and Obama's rising, and Andrew explained to me, 'No, it's not just the Democratic Party. It's David Geffen. It's Jeffrey Katzenberg. It's the executives in Hollywood who are actually the ones calling the shots, here.'

Gorka invited Marlow's description of Breitbart's character.

GORKA: Tell us a little bit about the true Andrew Breitbart, who you worked for as employee number one.

MARLOW: You couldn't have designed someone who was a better model for a fighter at the moment that Andrew was needed.

GORKA: Because he didn't care what the cost was.

MARLOW: Absolutely. In fact, he kind of liked it. He kind of got a surge off the hatred. I know it's all commonplace, now. If you're at all in public life now ... there's so much hatred that's out there, and everyone's trying to cut you down.

...

There are folks who kind of tune it out. There are folks who really hate it. And then there are folks who actually get a little adrenaline off of it. And Andrew was that. Andrew absorbed the hate so everyone could get accustomed to the new media landscape.

GORKA: But he actually used it in a kind of jiu-jitsu sense. He used it against those people who were so evil in what they said about him and the conservatives, and it starts with Clarence Thomas.

MARLOW: It does. In fact, his book's dedicated to Clarence Thomas, because he tuned into the Clarence Thomas hearings -- he was a budding news junkie but not on the right -- and he was expecting Clarence Thomas to get exposed as some sort of a pervert and horrible person, and instead it really embarrassed Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden, because they did the high-tech lynching, as Clarence Thomas described it.

Conservative talk radio figures such as Rush Limbaugh and Dennis Prager helped shape Breitbart's political views, explained Marlow.

""It's an incredible evolution from Andrew from liberal Hollywood type to right-wing superstar,"" stated Marlow. ""He had the full genetic makeup. He was hilarious,. He was so energetic. He knew the media from the inside. He knew the culture from the inside.""

GORKA: He looked to me as a man whose brain was wired differently.

MARLOW: Completely. He was so quick and funny and relentless.

GORKA: He just had a feel for what resonated in the media, didn't he?

MARLOW: It was pure feel. He referred to it, I think, as weaponized ADD, or something like that. He was able to use his obsession that he could get into these modes where he was so singularly focused on a topic and for awhile it was just trying to destroy the left and fight back against media bias.

The jiu-jitsu you referred to was kind of amazing. He used to retweet the hate on Twitter. He would retweet everyone, which I think was sort of riffing off of Dennis Prager's preferring clarity to agreement, which is that, 'Look, this is what the other side is saying.'

GORKA: Have a look.

MARLOW: 'They're saying these horrible things about me, my wife, and my children.' This is the left for you. And the left tries to use that on us, on the right, and it turns out they have to invent hoaxes all the time, now, because we're not that uncivil.

He had a unique set of gifts that I think made him uniquely qualified to fight the fight he was fighting, and not to mention just a dynamite news sense in general, having worked next to Matt Drudge for so many years at the Drudge Report

Gorka recalled Breitbart's analysis of expanding neo-Marxist influence in academia via the Frankfurt School:

Andrew, in a very digestible manner, maps out where these people came from, what their intent was, and how they took control of education, media, and the culture/ If you read just one chapter of Andrew's book ""Righteous Indignation,"" it must be that chapter that maps out what the left did to eventually bring us to a president who ... comes to office saying his mission is to fundamentally transfom the nation he wants to be president of.

Gorka praised Breitbart's analysis of the Frankfurt School's spread across academia as ""the most important thing I have read on politics in the Western World in the 20th century since I've started studies.""",744,Breitbart,Alex Marlow Talks Adrew Breitbart's Legacy with Sebastian Gorka
"Tucker Carlson declared Sunday night's Academy Awards irrelevant in a blistering takedown Monday night.

""Hollywood in some ways is over. It's diminishing in its power and its reach,"" Carlson told guest Mark Steyn on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

Steyn lamented that the Academy Awards ceremony was filled with ""pious, earnest, boring virtue signaling"" and that all the things that made the event great were no longer a part of the show.

""I think they are just going through the motions and they're doing it because this is just part of what it means to be an actor,"" Steyn said.

Earlier in the segment, Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe took aim at the ceremony for not being fun and insulting the audience.

""You think at some point they might realize that alienating 63 million Americans might not be the best rating play here or the fact that Americans don't really want to be lectured to by a bunch of smug hypocrites,"" Boothe, a Republican strategist, said. ""Everything's so poisoned by politics.""

"Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tendered his resignation earlier today:

Iran's top diplomat, an architect of the landmark nuclear deal, resigned on Monday, hobbling the relatively moderate government of President Hassan Rouhani and its chances of keeping the pact alive.

Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's unexpected resignation, announced on his Instagram account late at night in Iran, signals a victory for Iran's hard-liners, who favor confrontation with the West, as Washington ratchets up pressure on the country after pulling out of the deal.

Zarif has been under pressure from hard-line critics inside Iran for years, and that pressure has increased significantly since the U.S. withdrawal last year from the nuclear deal that he negotiated. His resignation seems to be an acknowledgment that hard-liners have gained enough ground at home that he is no longer able to do his job effectively. It appears that the proximate cause for Zarif's decision was his exclusion from a high-profile meeting with the visiting Syrian President Assad:

It is possible that Zarif's resignation won't be accepted, but the fact that he felt the need to offer it shows that his position has been steadily eroding over the last year. Hard-liners are in the ascendant inside Iran, and that is due in no small part to the Trump administration's destructive and bankrupt Iran policy. Iran hawks may like to pretend that Iran doesn't have domestic politics and that there are no differences between relative moderates and hard-liners, but this latest development proves them wrong once again. Their preferred policies have consistently empowered the political forces in Iran that are most hostile to the U.S. and engagement with Western governments, and today they have just delivered Iran's hard-liners one of their biggest wins in years.",746,The American Conservative,Zarif's Resignation and Our Bankrupt Iran Policy
"Just because Democrats are lurching leftwards doesn't mean they're going to lose in 2020.

Lately we have seen numerous conservative commentators posit the thesis that the Democrats are disqualifying themselves from a 2020 presidential victory by lurching too far left on key economic and social issues. The idea is that the American people simply aren't prepared to follow the Democrats into the leftist territory that seems to be their nesting place these days. Ergo, the party is in the process of ceding the White House to the incumbent Republicans, meaning a likely Trump reelection triumph.

This may be comforting to conservatives, but it is based on faulty political analysis. There is a strong prospect that 2020 will see the emergence of a new leftist president who represents democratic socialism of the European style -- a brand of politics eschewed by America since at least the end of World War II.

This perception is based on four broad political axioms worth exploring as the 2020 presidential spectacle gets under way.

Axiom 1: Presidential elections are largely referendums on the incumbent or incumbent party. In my 2012 book, Where They Stand: The American Presidents in the Eyes of Voters and Historians, I posited that if the incumbent's record is adjudged by the electorate to be exemplary, it doesn't matter much who the challenger is or what he or she says or does. The incumbent will win. If that record is perceived as unacceptable, then again it doesn't much matter who the challenger is or what he or she says or does. The incumbent or incumbent party will lose.

Of course, referendum politics shouldn't be viewed as the be-all end-all of every presidential election. Other factors come into play -- the character of the candidates, the record of the challenger, the issues being joined, the relative likability of the combatants. But incumbency performance is by far the most compelling factor. In Where They Stand, I noted the analytical framework for predicting presidential elections laid down by Allan J. Lichtman and Ken DeCell in their 1990 book, The 13 Keys to the Presidency. I also used that framework in the summer of 2016 in suggesting that, contrary to nearly all conventional wisdom at the time, Trump's chances were being underestimated. ""Trump,"" I wrote, ""actually can win."" I based that on what I adjudged to be Barack Obama's failed second term, characterized by ""a stalled domestic program, Mideast chaos, the ISIS threat, growing Islamist terrorism at home, intraparty frictions, and a lingering scandal"" involving former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's private email server. Based on how the electorate had reacted to such lapses through history, I concluded that the Lichtman-DeCell keys pointed to a Trump victory.

Similarly, the 2020 fate of Trump and his party will be driven far more by the president's performance than by the advocacy -- even very liberal advocacy -- of the challenger.

Axiom 2: In politically unsettled times, such as we're experiencing today, the nation often opts for experimentation.

If Trump's presidency is the product of referendum politics, then it also is a product of the country's willingness to try new things when the political class screws up. Hardly anyone thought Trump could be elected because few analysts sufficiently took into account the degree of ennui and anxiety in the land. But to many Americans, that ennui and anxiety rendered thinkable the prospect of a Trump presidency, whereas in normal times his boorishness and repellent traits would have made him entirely unthinkable as a president.

The campaign of 1980 was also waged in unsettled times, with raging inflation mixed with economic stagnation, sky-high interest rates, and fears of Soviet expansionism. Yet the conventional wisdom was that incumbent Jimmy Carter would likely win reelection because challenger Ronald Reagan was just too erratic, too extreme in his conservative views, and too much of a lightweight. But Reagan won big, not because the electorate suddenly turned conservative in its collective political outlook, but because the incumbent had squandered his claim to the job and because unsettled times called for trying new things, meaning a new president.

Or consider the 1850s, when the slavery issue roiled the nation and raised questions as to whether the matter could be settled short of war (of course it couldn't be). During those turbulent times, the country witnessed the demise of the previously powerful Whig Party, the emergence of the replacement Republicans, a seemingly hopeless split within the Democratic Party, and the 1860 victory of Abraham Lincoln under the banner of a party that hadn't existed eight years before. None of this was even remotely predictable. Similarly, during the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt captured the presidency for the Democrats after the GOP had maintained a hold on the office for 56 of the previous 72 years. One of FDR's recurrent campaign themes was the need for governmental experimentation in a time of economic crisis. This represented a case study in referendum politics mixed with a widespread national desire for change.

Axiom 3: Socialism is on the rise in America.

Much has been written of late about rising ""inequality"" in the country. A lot of it has been tendentious, but there is a growing perception that the country's elites have fostered policies from which they have massively benefitted while leaving the middle class in a state of economic decline. This perception happens to be correct, and it is the single largest factor driving American politics today. It elevated Trump to the White House.

But if Trump fails (a distinct possibility, based on what we see of his governing style), the resulting increase in civic anxiety and a natural desire for experimentation could drive the country to the left. That is precisely what Democrats are banking on.

They note, for example, the recent SurveyMonkey poll conducted for The New York Times, which indicated that 62 percent of respondents want the government to take actions to reduce the wealth gap. As two Times reporters put it, ""Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say it is immoral to have an economic system where some people have billions of dollars while others have very little.""

The poll also indicated significant support for Democratic policies that many conservatives consider beyond the political pale. Fully 61 percent, for example, support a 2 percent tax on net wealth above $50 million (advocated by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren) and a 70 percent marginal rate on annual incomes above $10 million (hobby horse of fledgling phenom Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). The poll didn't ask about the so-called Green New Deal, another massive governmental expansion proposal put forth by Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, but no doubt there is substantial support for it on the left.

Much has been written also about the political outlook of the Millennial generation, those born between 1981 and 1996. The Pew Research Center, after extensive surveys of these younger Americans, characterized their outlook as ""distinct -- and increasingly liberal."" Among them, Trump's approval rating, according to a poll conducted last year, was only 27 percent.

All this suggests that we shouldn't discount the possibility of a national lurch to the left, particularly in light of the final axiom.

Axiom 4: In today's divided America, political decision making resides on a knife's edge of parity.

Trump won the presidency in 2016 by collecting just enough votes in just the right states to cadge an Electoral College victory. That means we're operating these days on the margin of politics. Even quite small swings in just a few states could turn the next election against him. And Trump, with his lack of success so far in expanding his base beyond his current 39 to 43 percent approval level, doesn't project the kind of political force that would make him a strong reelection candidate.

None of this is a prediction. A lot could happen over the next two years. But the idea that the Democrats are killing their prospects for 2020 by lurching leftward isn't based on sound analytical thinking. The four axioms above suggest that the dynamics of American politics are more complex than that.

So it's possible that the country could get, for the first time in its history, an experiment in socialist governance, mixed with a far-left push on high-voltage social issues such as immigration, political correctness, and racial politics. That would be a recipe for failure, leaving the country even more desperate for political leadership to restore stability.

"Who can make the best argument for fighting climate change? If you said ""scientists,"" you have some catching up to do. The correct answer, the left apparently now thinks, is fifth-graders.

That's clear after climate-change warriors from a group called the Sunrise Movement on Friday used kids to confront Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The children obediently spit out rehearsed talking points about how the senator just had to support the Green New Deal.

In a democracy, you see, she had to listen to them, the voters (even if, as Feinstein pointed out, they were actually too young to vote).

The senator responded calmly and respectfully, fully engaging with the kids (and their grown-up puppeteers). She pushed back on their demands, informing them that the grandiose GND program is simply unaffordable. Hysteria, Feinstein was saying, doesn't translate into policy.

How refreshing to see a lawmaker (a Democrat, no less) take the time to explain a bit of reality to the kids in an open dialogue. Alas, much of the left doesn't want free debate; it wants, as Feinstein herself told the kids, ""my way or the highway.""

She's right: The whole point of using kids in the first place is to shut down debate. We must listen to the children: They're young and innocent. They're our future. They know best. Anyone who disagrees is somehow morally obtuse.

Thus, when Feinstein took issue with them, it infuriated many on the left.

One high-profile Feinstein critic: GND-backer Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In one of her ""I'm just a regular person who happens to be making dinner on Instagram Live"" videos, the 29-year-old novice congresswoman blasted Feinstein (though not by name). She mocked the 85-year-old lawmaker's claim that, after 30 years in politics, ""I know what I'm doing."" After all, Feinstein and her ilk have yet to solve all our problems, right?

In the video, which featured sweet potatoes and a side order of sanctimony, AOC also gave reasons to grant kids standing in the climate-change fight: ""There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult."" Even more: Global warming ""does lead young people to have a legitimate question: Is it OK to still have children?""

Uh, she might want to think that last point through: Without kids, who'll fight the left's political battles?

Perhaps AOC and others on the left have now given up on their mindless tautology about kids being our future. They've decided instead that they make better political pawns.

Feinstein, by the way, wasn't the only target of the kids' proxy war: On Monday, the Sunrise Movement also marched on Sen. Mitch McConnell's office to ""fight for a Green New Deal."" Someone should tell the kids that McConnell is pushing for the Senate to take a vote on the Green New Deal.

That this is seen as some sort of dirty trick by GND supporters should go a long way toward showing the kids what the grownups around them are really all about.

Nor is it just the Sunrise Movement trying to brainwash and exploit kids. My synagogue in Brooklyn sent out an e-mail a few days ago with the subject line: ""Kids are standing up to climate change -- yours can too!"" It urged the youngsters to sign a petition to support a group of teens suing the federal government over climate change.

And two weeks ago, my child's city public school launched an appeal for kids to join something called the Youth Climate Strike: ""Come to the steps of NYC City Hall on 3/15/19 at 12 PM with signs and a list of environmental demands for your future."" That's a school day, so it shouldn't be too difficult to coerce them to skip class.

Perhaps the left feels emboldened after the kids in the Parkland high-school shooting became America's instant sages on the issue of gun control.

But let's be honest: How good is your argument if you need to parade out youths, who are politically hard to rebut, to deliver it?

Short answer? Not very. And the grown-ups know it.

""Young people are leading, get used to it,"" Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff tweeted, in an attempt to push back on the idea that the children who confronted Feinstein are ""political pawns.""

"This month, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, citing widespread drug trafficking, which leads to about 70,000 dead Americans annually and increasing illegal immigration.

In a letter to Congress, former Republican lawmakers claim the national emergency to protect the U.S.-Mexico border is unconstitutional:

As Republican Members of Congress, each of us started with one central understanding of our party's overarching commitment: to honor our pledge to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. After each election, when our constituents granted us the privilege to again represent them in Congress, we renewed that pledge. It has always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to presidents or party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional republic we must act within the borders of the Constitution. Our oath is to put the country and its Constitution above everything, including party politics or loyalty to a president. [Emphasis added]

We who have signed this letter are no longer Members of Congress but that oath still burns within us. That is why we are coming together to urge those of you who are now charged with upholding the authority of the first branch of government to resist efforts to surrender those powers to a president. [Emphasis added]

We offer two arguments against allowing a president -- any president, regardless of party -- to circumvent congressional authority. One is the constitutional placing of all lawmaking power in the hands of the people's representatives. Article 1 of the Constitution, which vests the legislative branch with specific powers, states in section 9: ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."" The power of the purse rests with Congress because it is comprised of 535 representatives of the taxpayer and is the most direct connection between those being governed and those governing. If you allow a president to ignore Congress, it will be not your authority but that of your constituents that is deprived of the protections of true representative government. [Emphasis added]

The second argument goes directly to the question each of you must face: how much are you willing to undermine both the Constitution and the Congress in order to advance a policy outcome that by all other legitimate means is not achievable? The current issue -- a wall on our southern border -- has gone through the process put in place by the Constitution. It has been proposed by the President, it has been debated by Congress, and the representatives of the people allocated funding at a level deemed appropriate by Congress. We understand that there are many Members of Congress who disagree with the final funding compromise reached by a bipartisan group of legislators. To you, we ask this question: what will you do when a president of another party uses the precedent you are establishing to impose policies to which you are unalterably opposed? There is no way around this difficulty: what powers are ceded to a president whose policies you support may also be used by presidents whose policies you abhor. [Emphasis added]

Like us, you have taken an oath of office. You were elected to Congress to carry out the constitutional duties and responsibilities of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. You were sent to Congress to be the voice of the people. That is an awesome burden and it may require you to exercise restraint to protect the constitutional model -- that which is the root of American exceptionalism -- and to keep it from being sacrificed on the altar of expediency. [Emphasis added]

We who have served where you serve now call on you to honor your oath of office and to protect the Constitution and the responsibilities it vested in Congress. We ask that you pass a joint resolution terminating the emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019. [Emphasis added]

The former Republican lawmakers who signed the letter include Steve Bartlett of Texas, Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska, Sherwood Boehlert of New York, Rodney Chandler of Washington, William Clinger Jr. of Pennsylvania, Tom Coleman of Missouri, John Danforth of Missouri, Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, David F. Emery of Maine, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, James Kolbe of Arizona, James Leach of Iowa, John LeBoutillier of New York, Richard Lugar of Indiana, Pete McCloskey of California, Thomas Petri of Wisconsin, Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island, Christopher Shays of Connecticut, Peter Smith of Vermont, Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Alan Steelman of Texas.

Last week, a group of establishment Republicans and Democrats wrote a letter claiming that there was no need for a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border because there is no national emergency in regards to illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

This year, though, researchers project that up to 500,000 illegal aliens will successfully cross the U.S.-Mexico border and make it into the country, undetected by Border Patrol. Similarly, the country is on track for more than 600,000 border apprehensions in 2019, a level of illegal immigration that has not been seen since former President George W. Bush.",750,Breitbart,Former GOP Reps: Congress Must Terminate Border National Emergency

On the roster: Dems need more DiFi, less AOC - Dem debate over Rust Belt vs. Sun Belt intensifies - GOP donors worry about Trump's 2020 strategy - House to pressure Senate GOP on Trump emergency - Where are we going? Off campus

DEMS NEED MORE DIFI, LESS AOC

When she was first elected to the Senate from California a generation ago, Dianne Feinstein was one of the faces of the new ""third way"" Democratic Party: A social liberal who was also an economic moderate and tough on national security issues.

It took almost two decades for Democrats to recover from their 1968 hangover. But a new generation of leaders like Feinstein would not be so easily pigeonholed by Republicans as radical peacenik socialists who favored big government over economic growth.

On Friday, Feinstein found herself face to face with the next big thing in Democratic politics: Pressure mobs demanding urgent action to institute big government programs at the cost of economic growth.

Oh...

If you didn't see it during the initial social media splurp, you should certainly watch it. An environmentalist group brought schoolchildren to Feinstein's office where they hectored the 85-year-old senator for not having signed on to the Green New Deal.

As she's patiently engaging with the lower-school students, explaining that she has her own environmental policy preferences not drafted by a freshman congresswoman from New York, a high schooler piped up to interrupt Feinstein to tell her that there's no time to wait.

""You know what's interesting about this group?"" Feinstein said. ""I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing.""

Writer Caitlin Flanagan summed it up beautifully: ""The resulting encounter was so gonzo that it made Gran Torino look like The Pajama Game. At the 13th hour of a long career, Feinstein did something that the kids weren't expecting. She took them seriously, and she patiently explained some truths about American political life that they didn't understand. And then she did the one thing that an old woman isn't supposed to do. She said that she wasn't good at her job in spite of being old, but because of it.""

Liberal activists were outraged that Feinstein would dare contradict the claims of the children, who, as we know, are the future. The plan was asymmetric political warfare: Catch a politician in front of a basket of adorables, pull out the iPhones and make them squirm.

But Feinstein refused to engage on their terms. She acted like adults formerly did, which is to expect that children speak to their elders with due deference and respect. You do not shout at ladies and gentlemen old enough to be your grandparents, certainly not when they are speaking to you respectfully and courteously.

(Just a word here for activists - liberal, conservative or any other flavor - who press fifth graders into duty as political props: Don't.)

While Feinstein was puncturing the pieties of the Green New Deal in San Francisco, her fellow moderates elsewhere in America were getting punctured themselves.

The NYT accompanied some of the new moderate Democrats in this year's House freshman class as they held town halls back home. There, it was not the children of environmental activists but rather conservative constituents of their traditionally Republican districts.

""Last week, home for the first district workweek of their term, moderate Democrats got to see firsthand how the raised voices of a small but vocal number of lawmakers such as Representatives [Rashida Tlaib], Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York are reverberating in far more marginal districts. Some, like Representative Andy Kim of New Jersey, were asked to account for the 'uptick of negative rhetoric' coming from the freshman class.""

Democrats' new House majority doesn't rely on reliable districts like those represented by Tlaib, Omar and Ocasio-Cortez but rather those districts that Hillary Clinton either lost or won narrowly in 2016. And yet, it's the old-school Democrats from old-school Democratic districts who are grabbing all the attention.

As freshman Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, was asked: ""How long do you intend to ride that train with those people?""

Voters seem to be wondering the same thing.

A new survey from Public Opinion Strategies, the Cadillac brand of Republican pollsters, gives the GOP some cause for optimism. The poll found Democrats up in the generic congressional ballot by just 2 points overall and trailing by 7 points among suburban voters. That sounds like a good way to give back the House.

It's just one poll from one Republican polling firm, but it's yet another sign that a lot of Democrats are taking the wrong lessons from 2018.

If they want to win in 2020, they'll need more DiFi and less AOC.

DEM DEBATE OVER RUST BELT VS. SUN BELT INTENSIFIES

NYT: ""As the Democratic race takes flight, with one or more candidates entering the race almost every week ... one side of a long-simmering debate within the party [remains]: Should Democrats redouble their efforts to win back the industrial heartland ... or turn their attention to more demographically promising Sun Belt states... The numerical swap between the three Rust Belt states that handed Mr. Trump the White House and the most alluring trio of Sun Belt targets is nearly even: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin have a combined 46 electoral votes, while North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona offer 42. ... The dispute is not merely a tactical one -- it goes to the heart of how Democrats envision themselves becoming a majority party. The question is whether that is accomplished through a focus on kitchen-table topics like health care and jobs, aimed at winning moderates and disaffected Trump voters, or by unapologetically elevating matters of race and identity, such as immigration, to mobilize young people and minorities with new fervor.""

Silicon Valley <3's Cory Booker, and that could be a problem - Recode: ""If any Democratic presidential candidate has tapped into the Silicon Valley zeitgeist over their careers, it is Cory Booker. And in 2019, that could be as much a political liability as it is a financial asset. Although the presidential candidate has collected half a million dollars from the internet industry over his five years in the Senate, he found himself traipsing into a very different fundraising environment when he arrived in Silicon Valley over the weekend. Silicon Valley is itself a minefield that in some ways sums up the broader political challenge for Booker in 2020: He's running as a liberal on issues including tech regulation, but the progressive left holds him in suspicion -- and he could face more as he begins to court tech money more openly. As one political activist put it: 'He's going to run into problems as the public becomes more aware that he's in bed with our generation's Big Tobacco.'""

'I've already said that I will run my campaign differently -- no Washington lobbyist money, no PAC money, no auditioning billionaires to run a super PAC for me, and no dark-money groups devoted to supporting my campaign.'

She also said she would rely on small-dollar contributions and grassroots donations and volunteers.""

Bernie and the jets - Politico: ""In his campaign launch video last week, Bernie Sanders singled out the fossil fuel industry for criticism, listing it among the special interests he planned to take on. But in the final months of the 2016 campaign, Sanders repeatedly requested and received the use of a carbon-spewing private jet for himself and his traveling staff when he served as a surrogate campaigner for Hillary Clinton. In the two years following the presidential election, Sanders continued his frequent private jet travel, spending at least $342,000 on the flights. Increased scrutiny of his travel practices, which are at odds with his positions on wealth inequality and climate change, are among the challenges Sanders will face as he makes his second White House run.""

Sanders campaign claims 1 million volunteers - Fox News: ""Just six days after launching his 2020 presidential bid, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is celebrating a 'historic threshold,' claiming 1 million people have signed up to lend a hand to his White House campaign. 'Less than one week after we began, we now have one million volunteers in every congressional district in this country who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and get to work to make sure we win the Democratic nomination, that we defeat Trump, and that we transform the economic and political life of our country,' Sanders said in a video posted to his 9 million followers on Twitter. ...

It could have been the sparse crowd: Only about two dozen people braved blizzard-like conditions in Sioux City Saturday to attend the gathering organized by the Woodbury County Democrats, a traditional stop for presidential hopefuls. ... There was no mention Saturday night of the difficulties he has had taming homelessness, repairing the city's decrepit public housing or the fallout of the recent decision by Amazon to pull out of a plan to build a campus in Long Island City, Queens.""

GOP DONORS WORRY ABOUT TRUMP'S 2020 STRATEGY

Politico: ""Late last month, more than 100 major Republican donors gathered at the Trump International Hotel for a presentation from the president's campaign manager Brad Parscale and other top political hands on their plans to keep the White House in 2020 after a brutal midterm election. But several of the GOP contributors left the two-day retreat in Washington dissatisfied, dogged by essentially the same concern: The president doesn't really have a strategy to win reelection. They are chiefly worried about how he intends to prevail again in the Rust Belt states that voted for [President Trump] in 2016, but where Democrats performed strongly in last year's midterms. But there are also concerns about whether the president's fundraising apparatus is up to the task, and whether Trump will trample on any strategy or message the campaign does develop, as he frequently does. This account is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people connected to Trump's reelection, including two donors who attended the retreat and other Republican contributors who've given to Trump in the past.""

To rate a Trump challenger, examine previous primaries - FiveThirtyEight: ""One big question about 2020 is whether President Trump will face a serious primary challenger for the Republican presidential nomination. ... Only one potential opponent has formally launched an exploratory committee -- former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld -- but there's speculation that Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan might mount his own challenge to Trump. At this stage, this is good news for Trump. Arguably, neither Weld nor Hogan would pose that much of a threat. ... It would be incredibly difficult for a primary challenger to actually defeat Trump and claim the GOP nomination... So if a credible opponent does emerge, it may make more sense to judge the campaign by the relative success of the challenger, such as how many votes the candidate wins... In other words, we can better understand just how serious -- or not -- a challenge to Trump is by comparing it to past primaries against incumbent presidents.""

HOUSE TO PRESSURE SENATE GOP ON TRUMP EMERGENCY

AP: ""The fight about President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall is heading to the GOP-controlled Senate, putting Republicans in the uncomfortable spot of deciding whether to back his declaration of a national emergency. Enough Republicans are chewing over whether to support Trump's plan to create suspense about the vote and how the issue will play in the 2020 elections. ... The resolution is almost certain to pass the Democratic-controlled House, which is expected to vote Tuesday. If it also survives the Senate, Trump would be expected to veto it. Congress is not expected to muster the two-thirds majority to override a veto, which means the Republican president's declaration could move forward. But no president wants a rebuke from his own party. The math: The Senate is controlled by a 53-47 Republican majority. So it would take four Republicans voting with every Democrat to pass the measure and send it to Trump. More than four have voiced significant discomfort with Trump's move.""

Dozens of ex-GOP lawmakers and national security pros oppose emergency - NYT: ""More than 25 former Republican lawmakers and nearly 60 former senior national security officials appealed to Congress on Monday to kill President Trump's declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border, countering Republican leaders' effort to hold down defections Tuesday on a scheduled House vote to block the president. 'It has always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to presidents or party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional republic we must act within the borders of the Constitution,' wrote the former members of Congress, including Senators John Danforth, Chuck Hagel, Olympia J. Snowe and Richard Lugar, who implored Republicans to protect Congress's constitutionally mandated power of the purse.""

COLORADO GOV TO SIGN BILL HACKING ELECTORAL COLLEGE

The Hill: ""Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) will sign a measure to award his state's electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote, moving a countrywide coalition one step closer to circumventing the Electoral College. In an interview Sunday, Polis called the Electoral College an 'undemocratic relic' of the nation's past, one he wants to see relegated to the dustbin of history. 'I've long supported electing the president by who gets the most votes,' Polis told The Hill. 'It's a way to move towards direct election of the president.' Colorado will become the 12th state to join the national popular vote interstate compact. Those 12 states and the District of Columbia, which has also passed a popular-vote bill, account for 172 electoral votes, [98] shy of the 270 votes a presidential candidate needs to win the White House.""

""OK, Chris, what is with the verb 'woke'? You and Tucker Carlson use it often. Have the people in question been asleep?"" - Margery Peterson, Salinas, Calif.

[Ed. note: The key, Ms. Peterson, is that in this sense it's a noun rather than the traditional sense of ""I woke the dog when I got up early for work,"" where it is a verb. I think when ""woke"" the noun used un-ironically it is intended to mean something akin to the way Christians might use the term ""born again."" The idea being that a person had been oblivious to certain questions of social justice but now have awoken to the injustices around them and will therefore think anew and act anew, i.e.: Don't judge so-and-so because he used offensive terms in the past because he is now ""woke"" and acting in a socially conscious way. The term comes from the African American community, where it more specifically refers to the moment black Americans come to believe that that white racism is pervasive. The challenge thereafter is to ""stay woke,"" and, as rapper Meek Mill, put it in his 2018 song of the same name: ""The odds against you and they double stacked, stay woke."" It's about not allowing oneself to forget about racism. What makes the term so ripe for parody, though, is the way other social justice and left-wing groups and individuals have taken up the term. Like white-people dreadlocks and guys in pink pussy hats, white folks saying ""woke"" are easy targets for ridicule. When we use the term it's not a taunt, though, but rather to refer to a certain category of liberal activists who are very public and deliberate in signaling their membership in the social justice community. Here's how we used it in January: ""So it seems for Harris and Booker, as well. The two of them were already jousting during the televised spectacle of the most recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings, trying to be the most woke and most brutal in their performances. Harris got the better of Booker then and, we expect, will be in good position to do so again.""]

Progressive groups are reaching out to 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to support their push to expand the number of Supreme Court justices in order to diminish the current conservative majority.

So far, the drive by the group named 'Pack the Courts' is getting two maybes from Democratic presidential contenders and a no from a likely White House hopeful.

IT COULD BE AN HISTORIC YEAR FOR THE SUPREME COURT

""I don't think we should be laughing at it,"" South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat, said last week at an event in Philadelphia.

""Because in some ways it's no more a shattering of norms than what's already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today,"" added Buttigieg, an Afghanistan War veteran who last month launched a presidential exploratory committee.

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who's also launched a presidential exploratory committee, said last month on 'Pod Save America' that expanding the court or imposing term limits were ""interesting ideas.""

But the move to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court isn't flying with likely White House contender Rep. Eric Swalwell.

""I wouldn't. I think nine is good number. It's worked for our country,"" the four-term Democratic congressman from California told Fox News on Monday after he headlined 'Politics and Eggs,"" a must stop for White House hopefuls in New Hampshire.

""I don't want to let these extraordinary times that President Trump has put us in lead us to too many extraordinary remedies,"" the former prosecutor explained. ""I'd rather see us go back to a country of following the law, having qualified justices, and depending on the systems of government that we already have in place, just making those systems more accountable and work better.""

SWALWELL SAYS HE WAS 'RIGHTFULLY' SCHOOLED ON TWITTER

'Pack the Courts' told Fox News it is meeting with Buttigieg on Monday evening. The group highlighted that it's in the process of reaching out to Gillibrand, as well as the campaigns of presidential candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California.

""We're in the process of reaching to every declared Democratic contender and hope to both enlighten them to the importance of this strategy for taking back the Court and enlist their support for their strategy,"" 'Pack the Court' campaign manager Kate Kendell said.

Kendell said her group has received a $500,000 grant from the Palm Center, a progressive-leaning but independent non-partisan think tank in California to fund research on controversial and provocative policy proposals. She added they're now beginning to raise small-dollar donations from individuals to further fuel their effort to expand the number of high court justices.

The organization is partnering with 'Demand Justice,' another progressive group founded last year to try and counter GOP efforts to put more conservatives into federal courts.

'Demand Justice' director Brian Fallon - who served as press secretary for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign - highlighted that ""we strongly believe that reforming the Court -- especially by expanding it -- is the cornerstone for re-building American democracy.""

But Republicans say advocating to expand the number of Supreme Court justices will make 2020 Democratic contenders appear more extreme to voters come the general election.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faces backlash after Amzaon's decision to pull out of building a new NYC headquarters

Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh criticized Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Monday, saying she was not ""any different"" than the children who confronted Sen. Dianne Feinstein in her office last week after the New York Democrat asked ""is it okay to still have children?""

""So Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks it's time to stop having kids because of climate change. The world is not going to be livable. It's not gonna be worth living in if we don't make drastic changes. And she just keeps spewing this stuff. And there's nobody to tell her no. There isn't a single person in the Democrat Party with any guts to tell her no,"" Limbaugh said on his daily radio show.

""They've bought totally the indoctrination of climate change,"" Limbaugh told his audience, asking out loud why young liberals are fascinated with issues like Mars and rockets among other things.

""And Ocasio-Cortez, they're not growing up. They are for some reason stuck in a childhood or childlike existence. I mean, we're gonna play the audio sound bites of these young kids, 11-year-olds, 10-year-olds that stormed into Dianne Feinstein's office to tell her what-for about climate change. And I don't think Cortez is any different than them.""

Feinstein, D-Calif., was confronted by a group of school children Friday at her San Francisco office, urging her to support the Green New Deal. Feinstein rebuffed the children telling them, ""I know what I'm doing.""

Ocasio-Cortez took to Instagram Live over the weekend and brought up the ""moral"" issue of deciding whether to have children due to climate change and mounting student loan debt.

OPINION: THIS IS TRUMP'S BEST MESSAGE GOING INTO 2020 (AND HE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE IT)

""Our planet is going to face disaster if we don't turn this ship around,"" Ocasio-Cortez told her 2.5 million followers. ""And so, it's basically like, there is a scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult and it does lead, I think young people, to have a legitimate question. Ya know, should -- is it okay to still have children?""

Limbaugh called out members of the Democratic party and others for not confronting Ocasio-Cortez for continuing to make remarks on issues he believes she doesn't understand.

""Regardless of Cortez's ignorance and her just blatantly being wrong about practically everything she is passionate about, there's nobody on the side of reason who can combat her ideas. I'm talking about in electoral politics. Her ideas take off because there's nobody willing to say, 'You don't know what you're talking about. Be quiet, come back when you grow up,'"" Limbaugh said.

Limbaugh also found it amusing that she was cooking in her apartment during her Instagram live session, calling her out for benefitting from the very things he believes she is advocating against.

""Her appliances run on gas or electricity. The produce we assume that she's eating is brought to her by trucks that are fueled with gasoline or diesel. Her apartment is nice and warm, and there's not a solar panel anywhere around, and no windmill. She's got this really nice, warm, cozy life, easy access to food because of the massive infrastructure born of fossil fuels, and she wants to rip it apart,"" Limbaugh added.",753,Fox News,"Democrats unwilling to stand up to Ocasio-Cortez, 'tell her no,' Rush Limbaugh says"
"The fake news industrial complex is at it again: The media predict, by and large just like they did in 2016, that President Donald Trump faces impending doom and has no chance to win re-election in the upcoming presidential election in 2020.

CNN's Chris Cillizza is predicting President Trump would ""lose"" the election if it were now.

""If the 2020 election were today, Trump would lose,"" the headline of a piece Cillizza wrote over the weekend blares across CNN's website, with the senior CNN analyst writing that it is a ""good thing"" for Trump that election day is more than 600 days away.

To make his point that Trump would lose the election if it were today, Cillizza cites approval rating data from Gallup. He quotes this particular passage from a Gallup piece on Trump's approval ratings:

Although much can change between now and Election Day 2020, a job approval rating of 50% or higher would presumably put Trump in good position to win a state in the presidential election. The 17 states with 50%+ approval ratings account for a combined total of 102 electoral votes. In contrast, the states in which Trump has an approval rating below 40% account for 201 electoral votes.

In order to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, Trump would have to win all but one or two of the states in which his 2018 approval rating was between 41% and 49%.

After giving some more of his own analysis on what Trump needs to do between now and November 2020 to win in these key states, Cillizza then admits all of this analysis he has cobbled together actually means nothing.

""Now. Approval rating is obviously not purely predictive of vote,"" Cillizza wrote. ""After all, Trump won the 2016 election even though only 38% of voters viewed him favorably, according to exit polling. But if you are Trump, these numbers have to worry you. It suggests he has LOTS of work to do in the next 620 days.""

Interestingly, back when Cillizza worked at the Washington Post in 2016 before he joined CNN's crack politics team, he wrote a similar piece predicting Trump has no chance at beating then-Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. The piece was headlined: ""Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero.""

The piece, published 15 days before Trump smoked Clinton in the electoral college winning 30 and a half states when she could not even muster wins in 20 states-Clinton only won 19 and a half states-predicted that Trump had no chance at beating her.

""The election is in 15 days. And the electoral map just keeps looking grimmer and grimmer for Donald Trump,"" Cillizza wrote on Oct. 24, 2016.

In the piece, Cillizza predicted that Clinton would win Nevada-which she did, one of the only purple states that the Democrat won-and that both Utah and Texas would be competitive in the general election. Those two later predictions were completely unfounded, as Trump handily won both Texas and Utah.

But Cillizza claimed that Clinton was virtually unstoppable heading into the 2016 election:

Those changes tilt the electoral map -- and math -- even more heavily toward Clinton. Clinton now has 323 electoral votes either solidly for her or leaning her way. Trump has just 180. (Reminder: You need 270 to win.) And, virtually all of the vulnerability from here until Nov. 8 is on Trump's side. Arizona and Utah, two states that haven't voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1996 and 1964, respectively, are toss-ups! Texas, the one large-population state that has long been considered solidly Republican, is within mid-single digits! States like Colorado and Virginia -- swing states in the past two elections -- aren't even real opportunities for Trump anymore!

Cillizza is not the only one reviving 2016-style doomsday predictions for Trump ahead of the 2020 election. Politico has published a piece on Monday morning headlined: ""GOP donors: Trump campaign lacks a strategy to win in 2020.""

In the piece, which relies mostly on anonymous sources, Politico's Anita Kumar and Maggie Severns claimed that Trump has no strategy to win re-election.

""Late last month, more than 100 major Republican donors gathered at the Trump International Hotel for a presentation from the president's campaign manager Brad Parscale and other top political hands on their plans to keep the White House in 2020 after a brutal midterm election,"" Kumar and Severns wrote. ""But several of the GOP contributors left the two-day retreat in Washington dissatisfied, dogged by essentially the same concern: The president doesn't really have a strategy to win reelection.""

A couple paragraphs later, Kumar and Severns admit that they do not really have many sources willing to put their names on such a claim that Trump has no strategy to win in 2020: And that they relied almost exclusively on anonymous sources.

""This account is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people connected to Trump's reelection, including two donors who attended the retreat and other Republican contributors who've given to Trump in the past,"" Kumar and Severns wrote. ""Several campaign aides, who say they have spoken with anxious donors, also spoke to POLITICO. Most of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting Trump.""

The New York Times, too, recently published a piece from Christopher Newport University political science professor Rachel Bitecofer headlined: ""Why Trump Will Lose in 2020.""

The piece, which assumes that Trump is going to lose re-election, sets out to explain why he is going to lose-before he has even lost.

""The president is running hard on a strategy of riling up his base,"" the sub-headline of Bitecofer's Times piece reads. ""But by doing that, he riles up the Democratic base, too, and that one is bigger.""

In the piece, Bitecofer is very specific about where Democrats will win in her view:

Democrats will win big in more urban, more diverse, better-educated and more liberal-friendly states and will continue to lose ground in other states like Missouri. Although Mr. Trump may well win Ohio and perhaps even Florida again, it is not likely he will carry Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2020. Look at the midterm performance of statewide Democrats in those states. And his troubles with swing voters, whom he won in 2016, will put Arizona, North Carolina and perhaps even Georgia in play for Democrats and effectively remove Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire from the list of swing states.

The more the media predict Trump will lose, and that the Democrats will win-before anything happens-the more it seems to help Trump. Even Clinton's campaign manager in 2016, Robby Mook, has said that the over-the-top media predictions of Clinton winning and Trump losing-all of which proved to be false-helped Trump win and hurt Clinton:

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks,"" Warren wrote in a post titled ""The best president money can't buy,"" on Medium on Monday.

""My presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it,"" Warren said.

"According to reports, Igor Malashenko, a Russian media executive who co-founded and served as president of Russian TV channel NTV, was found dead in Spain on Monday. Russian media is reporting that Malashenko may have committed suicide. When originally founded, NTV regularly criticized current Russian President Vladimir Putin, but changed its tune with the government bought the channel in 2000.

The media executive who co-founded an independent Russian TV channel once known for blasting President Vladimir Putin was found dead in Spain on Monday, reports say.

It was not immediately clear where 64-year-old Igor Malashenko's body was discovered, but Russia media reported that he may have committed suicide, according to The Moscow Times.

Malashenko co-founded and served as the president of NTV, a channel that routinely criticized current Russian President Vladimir Putin during his first term in office, Reuters reports. It changed its tune after the Russian government purchased it in 2000.

Malashenko got into politics by joining Boris Yeltsin's campaign team to help steer him to a presidential victory in 1996, The Moscow Times added.

Speaking to Fox News during a visit here Monday, the likely Democratic presidential candidate admitted he was ""rightfully skilled"" on social media last week after complaining about having to go to somewhere other than Trump Tower for coffee. His post quickly garnered an avalanche of reaction, including from Trump supporters who mocked Swalwell and pointed out that there were plenty of alternatives for coffee in midtown Manhattan.

SWALWELL BYPASSES COFFEE INSIDE TRUMP TOWER, TWEETS ABOUT IT

""So I was rightfully skilled about that on Twitter and that's why I love Twitter,"" said Swalwell, D-Calif. ""Sometimes it's just a cathartic place to go, where you can dish it out and you better be able to take it and just move on to the next tweet.""

Last Wednesday, as he was making his way through New York City, Swalwell posted a selfie and wrote ""it's snowing in #NewYork. I need coffee. The closest cafe is inside Trump Tower. This is me walking to an alternative.""

Critics included Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who took to Twitter to mock Swalwell, saying ""since you've been operating in ""alternative"" universe for years, this should be easy for you. (Try the Russian Tea Room -- maybe you'll finally find your collusion.)""

Swalwell - a former prosecutor who's a member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees - has been a vocal critic of President Trump over the relationship between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.

DONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS FAMILY HAS NO FEARS OVER MUELLER REPORT

Asked about the reaction he received over his coffee tweet, an amused Swalwell told Fox News on Monday, ""I was in snow storm in Manhattan and was bewildered and the only coffee store around was Trump Tower.""

""Wasn't going to go there. Didn't know Manhattan very well,"" he added. ""Apparently there's like 100 other coffee shops within reach.""

Swalwell's on a two-day campaign style swing through New Hampshire - the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. His visit came as speculation over when special counsel Robert Mueller's report on his investigation into Russian tampering with the 2016 election will be delivered to the attorney general was reaching fever pitch, with some reports that the findings come be handed over as early as this week.

Swalwell on Monday predicted a bombshell in the report.

""I expect you're going to see that there has been criminal conduct by the administration to obstruct and keep the investigators from finding out what happened,"" the told reporters.

""When it comes to collusion, I don't know.""

Swalwell said once Mueller's investigation is over, the House Intelligence Committee will ""go back to work to fill in the gaps where they may exist because again, the Mueller team can only tell us what they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. If there's information that we need to secure for future elections or to make sure the rule of law is standing when it comes to abuses of power or obstruction of justice, we'll work on that.""

""We're also not sure if financial compromise is something the Mueller team is looking at. So we'll be looking at if there was financial compromise over decades from the Trump investments in Russia or the Russian investments in Trump,"" Swalwell added.

Donald Trump Jr. dismissed any notion that he, the President or his family have any fears relating to the Mueller investigation or a probe by the Southern District of New York.

""'This is going to be it, we finally got him.' I've been hearing this for two years,'"" Trump Jr. told ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning.

Later in the week Cohen - who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress last year about Trump's knowledge of a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow during the campaign - testifies behind closed doors in front of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.

""I look forward to seeing Michael Cohen. He lied to us last time he came in and plead guilty to that so I'm excited to hear that he wasn't to come clean but there's going to be tough questions about what he saw, what he did, and what his boss as businessman, as a candidate, and as a president, did,"" Swalwell said.

SWALWELL SAYS RICH 'GETTING OFF THE HOOK'

Swalwell took questions from reporters after headlining ""Politics and Eggs,"" a must stop for White House hopefuls.

The 38-year old four-term congressman - who was making his fourth trip to New Hampshire since early November - told Fox News he'll make his decision on a presidential bid soon.

The Republican National Committee took aim at Swalwell's ambitions Wednesday.

""In between his busy schedule of cable TV interviews, Eric Swalwell is back in New Hampshire as he mulls his all-but-certain Presidential bid. But instead of offering up policies that would benefit Granite Staters, Swalwell is focused solely on obstructing President Trump's pursuit of progress. Resistance is not a winning platform in New Hampshire or for 2020."" RNC spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said.

Meanwhile, Swalwell's already ramping up, hiring staff in the key early voting states.

And he's sounding more and more like a candidate, saying, ""I feel very connected every day Americans, being someone who was the first in my family to go to college, having student loan debt myself, and having two kids under two and seeing what that means for just working hard and wanting it to mean something. I think that's a candidacy that's unique and I'm close to making a decision.""

But Swalwell -who would be a very long shot to win the Democratic nomination - pushed back against suggestions he would use a 2020 campaign to try and line up a spot as running mate.

""I'm doing this because I think I can win. Not to sell a book, not for any other job,"" he answered.",757,Fox News,Rep. Swalwell says he was 'rightfully skilled' on Twitter after Trump Tower coffee selfie
"I just banned a commenter from posting here after he tried to post a comment that personally insulted me. As you longtime readers know, I try to have a liberal attitude towards comments. I'm pleased to post comments that are quite critical of me or anybody else who posts here, but I draw the line at personal insults and invective. Because I'm the only person who moderates comments, I sometimes slip up and let things through that shouldn't be there. If you see this, please let me know via e-mail (rod -- at -- amconmag -- dot -- com), or otherwise, and I'll be happy to review the comment and take it down if warranted.

I also reserve the right to refuse to post any comment, for any reason at all. For example, I post comments critical of Israel, but when I judge a comment crosses the line into anti-Semitism, I don't post it. This is a difficult call to make when readers criticize Jews as Jews. Again, I try to be as liberal-minded as I can, and allow wide discussion, but there is a line. Similarly, I want there to be a robust discussion about race and race relations, but when I get the sense that a particular comment on race is being made from a place of bad faith, or simply that it would make useful discussion harder, I won't post it.

For the record, I usually don't post comments that are nothing more than long blocks of text copied from another source. And there are times when I don't post a comment because it's so dopey I don't want it junking up the comments section.

Please do not assume that because I post somebody's comment, that indicates that I agree with them. You should also not assume that because your comment did not appear, it's because I sent it to the spam bucket. Alas for us all, the WordPress software has a quirky habit of marking some perfectly fine comments by longtime users as ... spam. Your jaw would drop if you saw how much actual spam the filter nets from bots. No kidding, we must get 300 or more spam comments generated by bots for every one comment from a real person the filter nabs. Sometimes those real-person comments are just fine, and I can't find any reason why it would have gone into the spam bucket. For example, to my recollection, I have never deep-sixed anything by the reader Turmarion, even though he can be a sharp critic of mine. Yet the spam filter seems to grab an unusual number of his comments. I can't explain it. He'll write me privately, and I'll go digging through spam, find his comment, and free it. I feel badly for him, but if I could make this not happen, I would. As imperfe

Y'all don't see the things that I don't post, so you (understandably) don't know how hard I work to try to keep this forum interesting, readable, and a place where all kinds of people can find something interesting there. That requires pruning. I like it when I have time to add an NFR (Note From Rod), but there are times when I'd love to do that, but I'm too busy. There is no rhyme or reason to why I add NFRs. All it means is that I had the time to do it right then.

Anyway, I bring this all up after having just read Scott Alexander's long explanation for why he stopped the Culture War thread, a subreddit affiliated with his popular Slate Star Codex blog. Alexander (a pseudonym) is a psychiatrist who is generally liberal in his politics and cultural outlook, but whose blog attracts all kinds of readers because it's really smart and interesting. He had a far, far more difficult job moderating his comments section (and he had volunteer helpers!) than I do, but his explanation for why you have to moderate them is quite good, and I urge you to read it.

In this part, he talks about why a blogger really has to be careful about what he allows into his comments section. It can destroy the blog and the brand of the publication that hosts the blog:

The thing about an online comment section is that the guy who really likes pedophilia is going to start posting on every thread about sexual minorities ""I'm glad those sexual minorities have their rights! Now it's time to start arguing for pedophile rights!"" followed by a ten thousand word manifesto. This person won't use any racial slurs, won't be a bot, and can probably reach the same standards of politeness and reasonable-soundingness as anyone else. Any fair moderation policy won't provide the moderator with any excuse to delete him. But it will be very embarrassing for to New York Times to have anybody who visits their website see pro-pedophilia manifestos a bunch of the time.

""So they should deal with it! That's the bargain they made when deciding to host the national conversation!""

No, you don't understand. It's not just the predictable and natural reputational consequences of having some embarrassing material in a branded space. It's enemy action.

Every Twitter influencer who wants to profit off of outrage culture is going to be posting 24-7 about how the New York Times endorses pedophilia. Breitbart or some other group that doesn't like the Times for some reason will publish article after article on New York Times' secret pro-pedophile agenda. Allowing any aspect of your brand to come anywhere near something unpopular and taboo is like a giant Christmas present for people who hate you, people who hate everybody and will take whatever targets of opportunity present themselves, and a thousand self-appointed moral crusaders and protectors of the public virtue. It doesn't matter if taboo material makes up 1% of your comment section; it will inevitably make up 100% of what people hear about your comment section and then of what people think is in your comment section. Finally, it will make up 100% of what people associate with you and your brand. The Chinese Robber Fallacy is a harsh master; all you need is a tiny number of cringeworthy comments, and your political enemies, power-hungry opportunists, and 4channers just in it for the lulz can convince everyone that your entire brand is about being pro-pedophile, catering to the pedophilia demographic, and providing a platform for pedophile supporters. And if you ban the pedophiles, they'll do the same thing for the next-most-offensive opinion in your comments, and then the next-most-offensive, until you've censored everything except ""Our benevolent leadership really is doing a great job today, aren't they?"" and the comment section becomes a mockery of its original goal.

If you think that I have been too quick to spam-bucket your comment on ""race realism,"" Jewish influence, and suchlike, I want you to understand that there's a reason for that, and Alexander explains why. On the other hand, if you think that I allow too much material that comes right up to the line, understand that there's a reason for that too (that is, I don't want to run a comments section that turns into an Our Benevolent Leadership forum). This is not easy work. I tell you that not because I want you to give me a cookie, but because I want you to know that I take seriously my job curating these comments, and I want to get better at it. But I know that I can't please everybody, and often can't even please myself.

Anyway, though Alexander is a secular liberal, he listens to and takes seriously people who don't agree with him. In the post I'm quoting from here, he shows a pie chart of a survey he took of SSC subreddit readers. Most of them are left-wing, but not a big majority. This is entirely understandable, given how intelligent and interesting Alexander's comments are. But, he says, eventually the most contentious categories (""Trump, gender, race, the communist menace, the fascist menace, etc"") began taking over the comments sections.

And then the trolls got involved. Alexander writes:

People settled on a narrative. The Culture War thread was made up entirely of homophobic transphobic alt-right neo-Nazis. I freely admit there were people who were against homosexuality in the thread (according to my survey, 13%), people who opposed using trans people's preferred pronouns (according to my survey, 9%), people who identified as alt-right (7%), and a single person who identified as a neo-Nazi (who as far as I know never posted about it). Less outrageous ideas were proportionally more popular: people who were mostly feminists but thought there were differences between male and female brains, people who supported the fight against racial discrimination but thought could be genetic differences between races. All these people definitely existed, some of them in droves. All of them had the right to speak; sometimes I sympathized with some of their points. If this had been the complaint, I would have admitted to it right away. If the New York Times can't avoid attracting these people to its comment section, no way r/ssc is going to manage it.

But instead it was always that the the thread was ""dominated by"" or ""only had"" or ""was an echo chamber for"" homophobic transphobic alt-right neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that the subreddit was dominated by homophobic etc neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that the SSC community was dominated by homophobic etc neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that I personally was a homophobic etc neo-Nazi of them all. I am a pro-gay Jew who has dated trans people and votes pretty much straight Democrat. I lost distant family in the Holocaust. You can imagine how much fun this was for me.

People would message me on Twitter to shame me for my Nazism. People who linked my blog on social media would get replies from people ""educating"" them that they were supporting Nazism, or asking them to justify why they thought it was appropriate to share Nazi sites. I wrote a silly blog post about mathematics and corn-eating. It reached the front page of a math subreddit and got a lot of upvotes. Somebody found it, asked if people knew that the blog post about corn was from a pro-alt-right neo-Nazi site that tolerated racists and sexists. There was a big argument in the comments about whether it should ever be acceptable to link to or read my website. Any further conversation about math and corn was abandoned. This kept happening, to the point where I wouldn't even read Reddit discussions of my work anymore. The New York Times already has a reputation, but for some people this was all they'd heard about me.

Some people started an article about me on a left-wing wiki that listed the most offensive things I have ever said, and the most offensive things that have ever been said by anyone on the SSC subreddit and CW thread over its three years of activity, all presented in the most damning context possible; it started steadily rising in the Google search results for my name. A subreddit devoted to insulting and mocking me personally and Culture War thread participants in general got started; it now has over 2,000 readers. People started threatening to use my bad reputation to discredit the communities I was in and the causes I cared about most.

Some people found my real name and started posting it on Twitter. Some people made entire accounts devoted to doxxing me in Twitter discussions whenever an opportunity came up. A few people just messaged me letting me know they knew my real name and reminding me that they could do this if they wanted to.

Some people started messaging my real-life friends, telling them to stop being friends with me because I supported racists and sexists and Nazis. Somebody posted a monetary reward for information that could be used to discredit me.

One person called the clinic where I worked, pretended to be a patient, and tried to get me fired.

And then Scott Alexander, psychiatrist, had a nervous breakdown. I'm not kidding. Read his post to learn more about it.

Please understand that I don't face anything like the pressures Alexander did, because he's a much bigger deal than I am. Still, I'm on that spectrum. When I meet readers of this blog in person, they usually say, ""How do you deal with all the nasty stuff that comes at you in the comments section?"" I tell them truthfully that I don't notice it. I've been an opinion journalist for almost all of the last 30 years, and I have developed dinosaur hide. If you see it posted here, rest assured that it does not bother me. Mostly I laugh at it. And I confess to taking malicious pleasure in sending to oblivion the comments, and the ability to comment, of anonymous keyboard would-be badasses who think they're standing up to The Man by insulting me in comments that will never see the light of day. They think they're being all Jack Nicholson (""You can't handle the truth!""), but I see them as more along the lines of Elmer Fudd, and you see them ... not at all.

You're welcome.

On the up side, I hear from people all the time who praise this comments section, and who say it's the only one they read. I'm talking about national print and broadcast journalists. One even asked me to put him in touch with commenter Matt in VA, so he could invite Matt to be on TV (Matt had to decline, to protect his job, which depends on his anonymity). Point is, you who work hard to play by the rules and offer good comments should take heart that lots of people read them. This blog gets well over a million unique readers each month; only the tiniest fraction of those readers ever post here ... but a lot of those readers do read you regular commenters too. I want to thank you for what you do here, and for helping to make this blog so popular. It's your blog too.

I love how big you've made this blog by your loyalty and your good comments over the years, but when the day comes when I have to spend more time moderating comments as I do writing them, it's either going to be time to get an intern to help out, or I'm going to have to shut down the comments section, for all the reasons Scott Alexander cut off his connection with the Culture War subreddit. Happily, I don't see that day coming soon. But note this passage from Alexander's long post about the effect trolls had on him:

Second, I wanted there to be at least one of these ""here's why we're removing your ability to comment"" articles that was honest, not made of corporate-speak, and less patronizing than ""we're removing the comment section because we value your speech so much and want to promote great conversations"". Hopefully this will be the skeleton key that helps you understand what all those other articles would have said if they weren't run through fifty layers of PR teams. I would like to give people another perspective on events like Tumblr banning female-presenting nipples or Patreon dropping right-wing YouTubers or Twitter constantly introducing new algorithms that misfire and ban random groups of people. These companies aren't inherently censorious. They're just afraid. Everyone is afraid.

That made me rethink my own outrage over Facebook's having banned for several hours my TAC blogpost about Jussie Smollett's hate hoax. Yes, it was wrong of them to ban it (as Facebook itself recognized by re-instating the ability of users to share the post a few hours later), but whatever algorithm snared the post was one no doubt designed to stop authentically bad people from sharing evil material. What happened to me was probably about the same thing as this blog's spam filter capturing a legitimate comment because some word in it triggered the algorithm.

Still, I'm glad the whole thing spurred me to at long last delete Facebook. I will miss the opportunity to reconnect with friends I haven't been in touch with for ages, but mostly, it wasn't worth it. If I didn't need Twitter to do my job, I'd be off of it too. Social media is not good for us. A (secular liberal middle-aged) friend e-mailed this morning to say:

Here's a serious question/hypothesis absolutely impervious to any kind of scientific-method investigation: How much do digital native kids form their entire identity -- the reflexive condescension, the automatic politicization, the ahistorical two-dimensional opinions, the insolent sanctimony, etc. -- on social media? From the first, embryonic stages of self-awareness, they have to forge a presentational self that is both distinctive and conformist simultaneous -- or even prior -- to the organic, fumbling process of constructing an identity IRL, interacting with real people, parents, adults, peers. The result is that these kids are walking, talking Twitter avatars. They are uninterested in listening, closed to temperate persuasion, because they are looking for followers and likes, even in person.

What a great observation. Most everybody who comments in my comments section uses a handle, and that's fine with me. Given how dangerous it can be to state your actual opinion in public, even if it's an anodyne one, I don't blame people for wanting to hide behind fake names. Still, I wonder how our dialogues here would go if people had to say the things they say here face to face. I know for a fact that I would state things differently, or not at all, because when I'm actually with people, I don't want to do much more than have a drink and a laugh. Partly because of the way I was raised (Southerners are taught to do whatever is necessary to put your guests at ease), and partly because personal conflict exhausts me, I'm a different person in real life than I am on this blog. I say things here that I wouldn't say to people's faces, and I've gotten much more like that, in part because of having to deal with all the extreme nastiness over the years (i.e., I don't want to talk about controversial things in conversation with strangers, because dealing with anonymous people in comments sections and on social media makes one EXTREMELY guarded, for reasons Scott Alexander eloquently illuminates).

It's always a balancing act, having to toggle between being honest in offering my opinions and thoughtful in remembering that actual human beings read those opinions, so I should resist the temptation to be a bloggy version of Addison DeWitt .

"The Girl Scout organization continues to engage in left-wing political activism, exposing young girls to liberal politicians and promoting their ideology.

""Since the 2016 Presidential election, the Girl Scout organization has placed an increasing focus on grooming young voters and future voters by sponsoring and/or promoting progressive political events, like the Teen Vogue Summit, Women's March, and anti-Trump rallies,"" Christy Volanski, co-editor at MyGirlScoutCouncil.com, told Breitbart News.

My Girl Scout Council, founded by Ann Saladin, performs research and provides documentation of the Girl Scout organization's ties to progressive politics.

""Given Girl Scouts' membership woes, it's a bit surprising that the organization continues to isolate conservatives by promoting polarizing political figures and activists like Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama, Andrew Cuomo and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"" Volanski added.

The Girl Scouts' G.I.R.L. Agenda 2018 emphasized the need to ""mobilize girls"" and urged ""leading change through civic action."" The organization praised those women and girls who were politically active, advancing a girl-first agenda.

On its blog post that celebrated 2018, the ""Year of the G.I.R.L.,"" GirlScouts.org touted how its girl members ""were inspired, prepared, and mobilized to take civic action"" by politicians such as Democrats Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Jill Biden.

The Girl Scouts boasted that socialist Ocasio-Cortez is an alumna of its organization and reported she attributes much of what got her elected to Congress to being a part of that organization:

In 2018, proud Girl Scout alum Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, and she attributes much of her career success to the experiences she had through Girl Scouting. ""I was a Girl Scout and learned so many life skills, from entrepreneurship to baking to survival skills,"" she beams. ""It's amazing at encouraging confidence and curiosity from a young age. Many women of Congress started out as [Girl] Scouts too!""

In June 2018, G.I.R.L. Agenda 2018 welcomed Jill Biden - wife of the former vice-president, as a keynote speaker who was described as an example of a ""change-maker"" who has ""taken action ... to make the world a better place"":

My Girl Scout Council posted to Facebook, ""The next time someone tells you Girl Scouts is nonpolitical, nonpartisan ... show them this,"" and provided a link to Biden's full address:

""Think of yourself as the next Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court,"" Biden urged the girls in her speech. ""Think of yourself as the next Michelle Obama, you know, our fabulous First Lady.""

Regarding Ginsburg, Girl Scouts in the Washington, DC, area touted their group visit to the screening of the film, RBG, about the life of the Supreme Court justice, with a blog post by one of the scouts.

""My troop left the movie excited about what Ruth had done so far, and what else we can do for gender equality - we've also started searching online for Notorious RBG shirts to give for Mother's Day,"" wrote the scout.

In January, Girl Scouts of Greater New York celebrated their governor - Andrew Cuomo - and his feminist agenda:

""Here is an agenda G.I.R.L.s can get behind!"" the organization posted to Facebook. ""We look forward to finally enacting the #ERA in New York State, modernizing pay equity, and a brighter future for our girls and women! Thank you, Governor Andrew Cuomo!""

The Girl Scouts organization shared a link to Cuomo's State of the State address in which he spoke of his intention to sign into law a bill that declared abortion a fundamental right.

When the Reproductive Health Act became law, Cuomo ordered authorities to illuminate the World Trade Center complex with pink lighting to celebrate it.

New York's new abortion law defines a ""person"" as a ""human being who has been born and is alive"" - meaning unborn girls are no longer ""persons"" in New York. The law further degrades unborn girls by removing criminal penalties for violence against them during a homicide.

Also in January, the Girl Scout in the DC area shared how girl members opened for former First Lady Michelle Obama's book tour. According to the blog:

Surrounded by thousands of fans, supporters and Girl Scouts former First Lady Michelle Obama hosted a[n] intimate conversation about her new book Becoming. She talked about her journey from girlhood to the White House, and how girls can achieve anything they put their mind to if they have the courage to go for it.

Girl Scouts all over the country had the opportunity to attend and open the show for Mrs. Obama and listen to her inspiring story. From finding the confidence to beat the status quo at Harvard to being a working mom, Mrs. Obama has been a champion for women and girls everywhere.

The Girl Scouts reported one scout wrote after hearing Obama, ""As a Girl Scout, I am becoming a promoter for social justice.""

""Without a doubt, 2018 was the year that the G.I.R.L. Agenda reached new heights,"" the Girl Scouts organization says. ""Whether it was a Daisy, Ambassador, or alum, Girl Scouts broke barriers, blazed trails, and changed the trajectory of communities around the world.""",759,Breitbart,"Left-Wing Activism, Ideology Pushed on Girl Scouts"
"Hundreds of conservative Latino students gathered in Phoenix, Arizona, over the weekend to attend Turning Point USA's annual Young Latino Leadership Summit.

Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder and executive director Charlie Kirk told summit attendees on Saturday that he is ""tired of seeing these racial demagogues on the Left, trying to make it seem as if your skin color must dictate a political preference.""

""I don't care what you look like, I care what your worldview is,"" continued Kirk during a Q&A session, ""The Left have become the true racists. They say -- Mexicans cannot be conservatives -- they say black people cannot be conservatives. That's a racist thing to say.""

One summit attendee asked Kirk what young conservatives can do to better deliver their message to fellow young people.

""We saw Beto O'Rourke -- Robert Francis O'Rourke -- running on that fake Mexican platform"" said the student during Kirk's Q&A session, ""We saw him gather, rally together the support of not only Hispanics, but Caucasians, and people from out of the state of Texas.""

""The Republican Party did not do a good job of reaching out to the youth,"" continued the student, who then asked Kirk what young people can do in order to better rally the youth in favor of conservative principles.

""It has to start culturally,"" answered Kirk, adding that one of TPUSA's core doctrines is a famous quote by Andrew Breitbart, who said, ""politics flows downstream from culture.""

""You have to expose people on the Left for their hypocrisy -- their lack of adequate factual basis of their beliefs,"" added Kirk.

The entirety of Kirk's response begins at time-code 15:00 in the video of he event:

In response to another attendee, who asked what he would say to someone claiming that conservatives are ""using identity politics"" by focusing on Latino outreach, Kirk said that the Left focuses on race, whereas conservatives value ideas that are found within Latino culture.

""I think we'd all agree there's a specific and unique Latino culture -- not race, not skin color, but there are values embedded in the Latino culture that should be appreciated and understood,"" said Kirk.

The TPUSA founder added that these cultural values include the ideas of ""hard work -- reverence -- faith -- God -- family -- pro-life.""

""The Left only talks about race,"" said Kirk, ""The cultural ideas of the Latino culture, [Leftists] want to obliterate completely, and just talk about people in terms of skin color.""",760,Breitbart,Charlie Kirk at TPUSA Latino Summit: Skin Color Does Not Dictate Political Preference | Breitbart
"The racialization of Academy Award 'firsts' from mammies to Spike Lee

When it comes to movies, the Oscars are one way of learning history. Students of film can peruse the annals to gather a sense of what movie culture was like in different periods, reading the list of winners (and nominations) as a guide to cultural standards and film-industry norms.

But journalists -- those who cover the entertainment beat as well as the Beltway -- abuse the historical function of the Oscars by routinely hijacking its significance. Specifically, when Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler won Academy Awards for, respectively, the costumes and art direction of Black Panther, many media wonks (professional and amateur alike) immediately proclaimed that they had ""made history as the first African-American women to win"" in those categories.

What kind of ""history"" is this really? When the reporting of news events carries such automatic estimation of cultural value, the term ""first"" is used as manipulation, a measuring rod of social progress.

This makes the political idea of ""progress"" more important than the subject being reported. Carter's and Beachler's work goes undescribed; their personal histories as people are delimited to the social-justice categories of race and gender. First-semester journalism classes used to teach that mentioning a person's race or gender was appropriate only when it was essential to the news.

When journalists refashion news this way, they imply that race and gender are the only things that matter -- the only way persons in the news need to be distinguished. The fact of Carter's and Beachler's wins can be simply stated, yet the media inflates those facts with prejudiced importance. They fake movie history by remaking the news.

In this way movie history is determined by political preference. The content and aesthetics of Black Panther are deemed irrelevant; only the ideological propaganda represented by Oprah Winfrey's Oscar-campaign statement that Black Panther ""is more than a movie"" is made to matter. Readers and journalists who don't understand this remain helpless before the suasion of demagogues and publicists.

Filmgoers who maintain their starry-eyed innocence about journalism, the Oscars, and the politics of the movies cannot sense how socially backward and culturally deceiving the racialization of the Academy Awards has become.

A few examples: The very showy acting prizes (which journalists call ""the major awards"") went to performers, Mahershala Ali and Regina King, who were repeatedly defined by their racial identity.

What went unmentioned was that each played racially and socially stereotyped roles: It is Ali's second win for playing a gay man (his first was for Moonlight), and King won for portraying yet another of the Academy's most favored clich√©s, the mammy.

When former Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs purged the Academy's elder members a few years back and instituted quotas to include more ethnic-identified voters regardless of industry status and experience, she set the stage for so many recent race-based Oscar nominations and wins. What looks like social progress was merely rigged electioneering. a politicization of the arts. Through improper journalistic acceptance -- and extension -- of this practice, film culture is turned into self-congratulatory propaganda.

The ugly consequences of this new, self-pleasing, progressive model could be seen in Spike Lee's win for adapting the screenplay of BlacKkKlansman, another of his race-baiting films advocating social dissension, mistrust, cynicism, and sarcasm. Reported as long-time-coming vindication for being denied an Oscar for 1989's Do the Right Thing, Lee's win was described in ""first"" terms. Almost every journalist and pundit missed the real news behind Lee's BlacKkKlansman's consolation victory.

It is a well-kept secret that few filmgoers actually like Lee's movies. The films are artistically jumbled, politically specious, and stressful, not entertaining. Over the years, critics have customarily hidden their lack of enjoyment by praising Lee's films when they open, then forgetting about them at year's end during the lists and prizes season. BlacKkKlansman was the first exception to this pattern, for reasons that are inconvenient for journalists to recognize and admit. Lee's contumely in BlacKkKlansman was welcomed because it fit the mainstream-media narrative to discredit the current administration. The media are fond of Lee's spurious ""six words"" quote about his film: ""Black Man Infiltrates Ku Klux Klan."" But the fact is BlacKkKlansman's black lead character (John David Washington) never infiltrates the Klan; it's the white Jewish character (Adam Driver) who performs the imposture. In this way BlacKkKlansman is similar to the Oscar-winning Best Picture Green Book, which features a black-white buddy team to point out the racial tension in America's past. Lee wasted no time after the ceremony to immediately discredit Green Book's victory as ""a bad call.""

So last night's awards hold interest for laying out the political economy of Hollywood (both the motion-picture Academy and the body of mainstream filmmakers who constitute it). Each film that was honored demonstrates the values that each institution set for itself and before the public.

So when it comes to movies, that old saying ""History is written by the victors,"" should be amended to: Movie history, like movie news, is faked by journalism's losers.",761,nationalreview.com,Faking History and Remaking Oscar News | National Review
"One of the dumbest and most vexing of all banalities is the condescending claim that someone is ""trying too hard.""

""Trying to hard"" is something that always offends those who have too much and got what they have too easily.

Jay Nordlinger relates a priceless anecdote about the Indian educator Ben Chavis, who, having been accused of (angels and ministers of grace defend us!) ""acting white,"" responded: ""'Acting white' is not enough. I'm acting Jewish. Or maybe Chinese.""

Trying too hard? No such thing.

But I understand what they mean. It's not the effort that causes eye-rolling, but the insincerity.

I give you Senator Elizabeth Warren.

If there is anybody in American politics in 2019 who is trying too hard, in that sense, it is Senator Warren.

Senator Bernie Sanders needs to expend very little effort to convince the world that he is a left-wing kook, because he is a left-wing kook, an old-fashioned red who couldn't think of enough nice things to say about the Communists who murdered 100 million people in the 20th century. Senator Kamala Harris is not trying too hard, and it shows: ""It doesn't matter what it costs,"" she says. Oh, but it does, Senator -- to the people who have to pay for it. Robert Francis O'Rourke might try too hard one of these days, if he can get around to it.

Senator Warren is a familiar type of character, one that is not necessarily dishonorable: the grinder. I know the grinders when I see them. I went to nerd school -- imagine a West Texas high school where everybody knows your SAT score and nobody knows who the starting quarterback is -- and you meet a lot of grinders at nerd school. I had a few of them when I used to teach, too: ""Tell me exactly what I have to do to get an A in this class."" But, like I said, I don't think that there is such a thing as trying too hard, and the grinders play to their strengths: brute force. It's like the two or three times a year I do the dishes: I don't bring any joy or panache to the task, but I can keep scrubbing until the work is done or somebody tells me to stop because I'm taking the enamel off the Le Creuset.

Some grinders are my kind of people: relying on work ethic for what they don't have naturally. Some of them are Tracy Flicks.

Senator Warren is a Tracy Flick. Tell me this isn't basically Elizabeth Warren vs. Howard Schultz:

Of course she was attracted to the law. Law school is Grinder HQ, ground zero for ambitious mediocrities, the best practical option for people who aren't fast enough to work on Wall Street or creative enough to work in Silicon Valley and too lazy to hustle real estate. Law school is the grand entrep√¥t of political hackery -- Chuck Schumer didn't even bother making a desultory effort at practicing law after finishing up law school; he was running for the New York state legislature before he even passed the bar.

Senator Warren is a seeker after celebrity. She never had much of a legal career (she wrote wills and the like from home) and instead sought the pseudo-celebrity of academia, which offers many attractions: gentle workloads, security, a measure of prestige, and -- not least -- a stage. Academic life can be very rewarding -- Senator Warren and her professor husband earn nearly $1 million a year between then -- but that wasn't enough. Warren became an author of dopey self-help books and an occasional cable-news guest, instructing Lou Dobbs on the tribulations of the middle class. She found a bigger audience in activism, and a bigger one still after securing a very safe seat in the Senate representing Massachusetts, from which comfortable perch she pretends to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted -- she's very comfortable with some of the comfortable, including the big corporate law firms that sponsor her campaigns -- as she seeks, ever hungrily, after larger venues.

What she believes is . . . contingent. She was, not too long ago, a full-throated advocate of school choice, writing: ""With fully funded vouchers, parents of all income levels could send their children -- and the accompanying financial support -- to the schools of their choice."" That kind of heresy does not get you nominated by a party run by public-sector union bosses, and so she has evolved on that and other issues. She reminds me of the womanizing football player in Infinite Jest who approaches his potential conquests with cheerful honesty: ""Tell me what sort of man you prefer, and then I'll affect the demeanor of that man.""

What kind of candidate the Democrats prefer just now is a left-wing kook, but one who isn't an old white guy with creepy help. Senator Warren is no longer being advertised as a woman of color, and the Democrats have not had the very best of luck with awkward white grandmothers in recent years.

So, Senator Warren may not make it. But it won't be for lack of trying.",762,nationalreview.com,Senator Tracy Flick | National Review
"Though its ratings are slightly up from last year, I'm assuming that's due to people tuning in to see what it was like without Jimmy Kimmel. (And who can blame them? I'd watch ABC at least once for that.) We weren't always this indifferent to the Oscars. In fact, we should never be because there can be no civilization without culture. Andrew Breitbart understood this. His axiom that ""politics is downstream from culture"" implied that the latter made the former possible.

Filmmaking has always been the pinnacle of American pop culture because it is the most authentically American art form. We invented it (Thank you, Thomas Edison), and we perfected it (Thank you, Golden Age Hollywood).

But I wouldn't be surprised if a cat meme video on Twitter got more viewers last night than the most prestigious awards show for our most important art form. At a time when we're haunted by the specter of American decline (which some of us are doing our damnedest to chase off, no thanks to Hollywood), it's not exactly heartening to see our cultural capstone crumbling under the weight of its own irrelevance.

I can think of two reasons why no one watches the Oscars anymore.

First, because the films mostly suck. Hollywood churns out shallow, derivative, boring mediocrity unworthy of three hours of our attention. Pull up a list of Best Pictures from years past, and you'll see just how far the mighty have fallen.

Still, for a long time, we tuned in out of habit and nostalgia. And that brings me to the second reason why no one wants to watch the Oscars anymore.

When Trump got elected, the celebs went next-level woke. Like the egotistical morons they are, Hollywood turned on the customers who had been patiently humoring them despite diminishing returns. As John Nolte likes to say, ""If Mr. Whipple called you a racist homophobe, would you buy Charmin or something else? We're just hating you back, Hollywood.""

Yes, we've been insulted, and we're sick of it. But I can overlook a lot of insults if you give me something worthy of praise. Maria Callas insulted a lot of people, but we still wanted to hear her sing. Can we say the same about the films nominated for Best Picture?

And this brings me back to my first point about the movies sucking.

Let's be honest. How many of us watched the films nominated this year? I'll go first. I'll start with the one I did see...

Bohemian Rhapsody. I despise Bryan Singer, but I watched his film because I love Queen. For those of you who don't want to see it or don't have the time, watch the YouTube of Queen's Live Aid performance. There. Now you've seen the best part of Bohemian Rhapsody.

Roma. I tried to watch it. I really did. I got through the opening sequence where a woman is mopping water down a drain for what feels like forever. It was an apt metaphor for my receding patience. I quit about five minutes in and felt guilty for doing so because the film came highly recommended by a colleague I respect. But to be honest, I felt more obliged than inclined to watch it, and I'm tired of movies that are more ""important"" than enjoyable.

A Star Is Born. It's been re-born four times. It's had more reincarnations than Shirley MacLaine. Let it reach nirvana already.

Vice. If you're going to make a movie about Darth Vader, at least let there be lightsabers in it.

Black Panther. It's a comic book movie. Grow up.

The Favourite. Didn't see it. Looks funny. Might see it someday, but a film about a lesbian m√©nage √† trois starring Queen Anne is probably too niche for inflight viewing.

Green Book. It won Best Picture. It looks like Driving Miss Daisy meets Ray, both of which I enjoyed. The Driving Miss Daisy analogy wasn't lost on Spike Lee, whose Do The Right Thing, which I also loved, was bested by Miss Daisy in 1989. Last night, he was reportedly double-fisting cocktails at the after-party bemoaning Green Book beating his BlacKkKlansman, a film which is as far from Do The Right Thing as Godfather III is from the first two installments.

And that brings me to the final film. Sore losers go last, Spike.

BlacKkKlansman. When I was in film school, they taught us, ""If you want to send a message, try Western Union."" Translation: stick to good storytelling because no one wants to see your ""message"" film. That was back in quaint old 1999. In 2019, everyone is sending messages, and Spike Lee's message to America is that we're all closeted racists.

His film about a secret KKK network in the 1970s ends with footage of Donald Trump in 2017 talking about the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally. Subtle, I know. Spike wants us to know that Donald Trump and, by implication, his voters are probably hiding white hoods in their closets behind the MAGA gear and tiki torches.

Far be it from me to chastise a great filmmaker like Spike Lee, but once upon a time, American filmmakers inspired us to be tolerant without berating us. They appealed instead to the better angels of our nature.

Take, for example, the great George Stevens, who won the Best Director Oscar in 1957 for his masterpiece Giant. Stevens started out in Hollywood as a director of light comedies. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Signals Corp, where he filmed the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps and helped prepare the evidentiary footage for the Nuremberg Trials. Needless to say, the war changed him forever. For the rest of his life, he dedicated his artistic talent to making sure the horrors he witnessed were not repeated.

Without lecturing or insulting his 1950s audience, Stevens used his epic film about Texas to show that our patriotism transcends race. In one of the film's most moving sequences, Stevens depicts the return home of the flag-draped casket of Angel Obregon, a Mexican American cowboy who the audience has seen grow up from a baby into the first young man on the ranch to volunteer to serve in World War II.

Stevens needed no dialogue to convey his message. Instead, he showed us a burial at dusk. A Catholic priest blesses Angel's casket, an honor guard fires a three-volley salute, and a choir of Mexican American children sing The Star Spangled Banner as Angel's weeping parents are handed the flag their son died to defend.

The subtext was not lost on the patriotic Americans of 1957 who had lost so many of their own sons in that war. Stevens was saying, ""Angel died for his country just like your sons. Surely he deserves the same respect.""

By the time we reach the film's climax, when Rock Hudson's character fights a racist diner owner who refused to serve an elderly Latino couple, the audience is cheering for him in righteous indignation.

That was how Hollywood used to do it. They didn't lecture us about how bad we are; they reminded us that we are good.

Unlike Spike Lee, Stevens didn't think Americans were evil. He knew we were the good guys who defeated unspeakable evil. Yes, we are made of the same crooked timber as the rest of humanity. But we're the country that freed the world from totalitarian racists.

But that was then. Now Hollywood makes movies that mostly make us want to watch old reruns of just about anything made in the era that I call ""B.M."" - as in, ""Before Millennials.""

Before the woke Millennials came of age we had things like free speech, comedy, and two sexes. Safe spaces were places where you put your jewelry, and triggering was something John Wayne did with a gun. Back in those days you had to speak to people face to face before arranging a one-night stand with them.

Hollywood was always full of obnoxious liberals, but they became insufferable left-wing bores in the ""A.M"" era (i.e., ""After Millennials""). Trump's election just pushed them further over the edge.

Though it pains me to say this, we need Hollywood because, as noted above, civilization requires culture. So, let me offer Tinseltown some advice.

If Hollywood cares about winning back its lost audience - and that's a big ""if"" because narcissists seldom notice when the room is empty - they could start by making better films.

Artists need stimuli to create. I suggest they tap into the rich reservoir that is America by actually getting to know the American people. They could start by leaving their coastal bubbles and venturing forth into fly-over country. Imagine their surprise when they learn we're not all Klan members!

And who knows, with a little luck they'll be inspired to make a movie that hasn't been re-made three times already.",763,Breitbart,"Mansour: The Oscars Used to Be Big, It's the Pictures That Got Small"
"Making the case that actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated a fake attack on himself, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Jackson said that, as a black man, ""I know the racial divide that exists here.""

But after alleging that Smollett, who is black and gay, ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Jackson added, ""I'm left hanging my head and asking, 'Why?' ""

Good question. Why, indeed, would an actor reportedly making $1.8 million a year stoop so low and risk it all?

GARRY MCCARTHY: SMOLLETT CASE DOES DAMAGE TO CITY IN NEED OF FRESH START

The short answer is greed; Smollett allegedly wanted a raise.

But assuming that Smollett is not completely off his rocker, there must be more to his thinking, and there is. The added element also explains much of the vicious, anything-goes turmoil roiling our nation: Smollett thought he could get away with it.

And why not? One look around America would tell him that blaming President Trump and his supporters for the worst things imaginable is the fastest way to become a celebrated victim and a hero to half the country.

And victimhood is making some people very, very rich.

Smollett could have correctly concluded that events don't even have to be true to be solid gold. Enough people are willing to believe the worst because, hating Trump with every fiber of their being, they need the worst to be true.

The more serious the charge, the more they fantasize it will be the death knell of his presidency. That makes Trump haters easy prey for con men.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren played on their fantasies when she said the president ""may not even be a free person"" next year. Her words made headlines, not because she has any insider knowledge, but because her claim sent lefty hearts aflutter.

Warren, of course, is a professional con artist of long standing, so expect to see more sleight-of-hand as she seeks the Oval Office.

If police are correct, Smollett played his trick by scripting events designed to activate all the erogenous zones on the political and cultural left. His claim that his ""attackers"" made racist and anti-gay slurs, threatened to lynch him and declared Chicago ""MAGA country,"" was an immediate smash hit with his intended audience.

Overnight he became a household name as Hollywood and Democrats -- excuse the repetition -- embraced his story without a shred of doubt. See, see, they said, that's Trump's America for you.

Smollett played the Trump haters like a Stradivarius.

Their enthusiasm reflected their self-interest. Smollett's story was tailored to fit all the corners of the narrative they've been selling since Trump came down the escalator in June 2015 to announce his candidacy. Smollett played the Trump haters like a Stradivarius.

He got bonus points for being the right kind of victim but the clumsy plot outlined by cops shows he lacks the gravitas of more experienced cons. Take Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who is turning a disgraceful career-ending episode into a major pay day.

McCabe, after failing to bring down Trump, got fired for lying under oath -- but now gets the star treatment on a book tour. What Trump-hating lefty wouldn't want a piece of that action?

Perhaps Smollett fantasized he could get rich like McCabe or suddenly become a giant media star like James Comey. The former head of the FBI, Comey tarnished the bureau's legacy for a generation, then painted himself as a victim of Trump and helped to spur the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

For his efforts, which included a book and coming out of the closet as an anti-Trump partisan, Comey became a millionaire several times over.

Of course, Comey and McCabe didn't exist in a vacuum. They were part of an administration that weaponized law enforcement and intelligence to boost their preferred candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, and destroy Trump.

Seeing how they basically got caught and still got rich, Smollett might have decided that, no matter what, he'd be rewarded, much as former top officials James Clapper and John Brennan got TV contracts after clearly abusing their official powers to play politics.

As for Clinton herself, she lost an election she should have won in a cakewalk -- yet managed to launch the lie that Trump stole victory. Her lie remains an article of faith among deluded millions who believe it because they want it to be true.

But Smollett's scheme would have made no sense unless he could count on the complete cooperation of one other player: the media. He would need them to swallow his story, then amplify it and repeat it a thousand times over.

Naturally, they did, because they, too, desperately wanted it to be true.

He hand-picked his interviewers, and played the role of his life -- a defiant victim of Trump Nation. Smollett aimed to be so good and so appealing that he wouldn't just get a raise, he'd be a mega-star and his career would take off like a rocket.

He might even have gotten a call for a starring role in Sunday's Oscar telecast. Imagine the Hollywood elites, comfortable in their sneering disdain for Trump's America, rising to applaud him as he appeared on stage as a stand-in for their America.

"President Trump is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the second time in Hanoi, Vietnam on Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.

Both leaders previously met are one-on-one in Singapore on June 12. During his State of the Union, Trump emphasized the nation would continue its ""historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula"" and praised his ""good"" relationship with North Korea's president.

The U.S. and North Korea do not have formal diplomatic relations. The two nations remain in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty -- but there's growing speculation Trump may offer an announcement of peace and a formal end to the Korean War if he can convince Kim to commit to denuclearization.

TRUMP, KIM JONG UN'S SUMMIT IN VIETNAM: WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE LEADERS' SECOND MEETING

Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, became the first member of the current regime to visit South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953 when she attended the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, as part of North Korea's delegation last year.

As Tump and Kim prepare for their second summit, here's what you need to know about some of the key players in the regime.

Kim Jong Un is the current supreme leader of North Korea, rising to power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in 2011. His mother, Ko Yong Hui, was an opera singer who died in 2004.

Overall, little is known about the leader's early life.

He studied in Switzerland before returning to North Korea to attend the Kim Il Sung Military University in the mid-2000s, Michael Madden, the director of North Korea Leadership Watch and a visiting scholar at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins SAIS, told Fox News. The university, which is located in Pyongyang, the country's capital, is named after Kim Jong Un's grandfather.

""We don't know a tremendous amount about him [Kim Jong Un],"" said Madden. ""But we have enough for a good picture.""

NORTH KOREA KEEPS AMASSING NUCLEAR MATERIAL DESPITE PROMISING TO DENUCLEARIZE, REPORT FINDS

Contrary to popular belief, Madden said the North Korean leader, who's in his mid-30s, has a ""relatively cool-headed personality"" which serves as an asset. ""He derives more power by being laid back and cool"" as opposed to being reactive, Madden said.

From an early age, Kim's mother positioned her son to be her husband's potential successor. She pushed for him to attend military school, Madden said, where he was tutored by top North Korean officials in artillery. His schooling positioned him to be a top contender.

As for the leader's notorious missile program, Madden said the North Korean leader ""views the missile program like a sports team."" In other words, a sports team doesn't win every game, but learns from its losses -- and Kim Jong Un reportedly takes the same viewpoint.

Kim Yo Jong is Kim Jong Un's sister. The 30-year-old has always been a ""tomboy"" with a ""pleasant"" personality, Madden said.

Like her brother, she also attended school in Switzerland at a young age, where she was once described as ""sheltered"" by the school's principal, according to Madden.

Despite North Korea's conservative and patriarchal society, Madden thinks Kim Yo Jong could easily succeed her brother one day.

""Kim Yo Jong has a bigger policy portfolio [than her brother], and is more powerful than we're giving her credit for,"" Madden said.

In October 2017, Kim Jong Un promoted his sister to a top decision-making body, replacing her aunt as the Workers Party's Politburo. She also serves as one of Kim Jong Un's ""closest aides,"" Madden said, and manages her brother's schedule, bodyguards and meetings.

KIM JONG UN'S SISTER, KIM YO JONG, IS REPORTEDLY PREGNANT, REPORTS SAY

She's an ""iron hand in a velvet glove,"" Madden said.

Kim Yo Jong visited South Korea for the 2018 Winter Olympics -- a move that made her the first member of the current ruling family to step foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War. She was part of the North's delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics.

Additionally, Kim Yo Jong, sometimes called ""North Korea's Ivanka [Trump],"" is reportedly pregnant with her second child, sources told The Korea Herald.

Kim Sul Song is Kim Jong Un's other sister and Kim Yo Jong's half sibling.

Kim Sul Song is the only daughter from her father's ""official marriage,"" according to Madden. Kim Jong Il was polygamous, but his official wife -- as a result of matchmaking by his father -- was Kim Young Sook, according to The Telegraph. She was Kim Sul Song's mother.

Kim Sul Song, 44, is a ""very powerful woman"" who was a part of the regime's leadership cohort at one time. As of now, however, it's not clear if she's been ""put on the side or is working behind the scenes,"" Madden said.

Kim Sul Song once served as an interpreter and close aide to her father. She reportedly managed his travel logistics until about 2008.

Also known as ""Madam Kim,"" Kim Kyong Hui is Kim Jong Un's aunt and sister of his late father.

Madden described her as a ""very powerful woman."" Now in her early 70s with a shaky health record, Kim Kyong Hui once was the director of the country's flight industry -- a title that ""concealed her real power,"" Madden said.

Madam Kim served as her brother's closest aide and was also in charge of the Worker Party's international affairs department, according to Madden. She once led talks with Israel in the 1990s when the country approached North Korea about buying its nuclear program to protect itself from Iran, Madden said.

""People close to her rose in status within the regime.""

-- Michael Madden

NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM HAS GROWN WITH EACH KIM REGIME

Madam Kim, who was married to Jang Song Thaek -- Kim Jong Un's uncle who was executed in 2013 for reportedly planning a military coup -- also served as executor of Kim Jong Il's will after he died.

Kim Yo Jong, who is reportedly very close to Madam Kim, often calls her now-retired aunt for advice, Madden said.

""People close to her rose in status within the regime,"" he added.

Kim Jong Chol is Kim Jong Un's half brother. Unlike his relative, Kim Jong Chol does not have an interest in the country's politics. Instead, according to Madden, he serves as a contributing writer to some of North Korea's state-run publications.

He's reportedly interested in music and films and has a well-documented affection for the singer Eric Clapton. He also has health issues, according to Madden, though it's unclear what exactly they are.

Not much is known about Kim Jong Sik, who is thought to be in his 50s and the scientist behind many of North Korea's missile successes.

In a previous interview with Fox News, however, Madden said Kim Jong Sik was ""plucked from obscurity"" by Kim Jong Un, first catching the leader's attention after he helped to successfully launch an Unha-3 rocket in 2012.

Kim Jong Sik ""rose to prominence by fixing and identifying mistakes while developing missiles,"" Madden said.

Madden said Kim Jong Sik holds the title of ""deputy director,"" a title that holds more power than some ""senior officials."" Kim Jong Sik also has some personnel and policy-making power.

""Kim Jong Sik is someone that might end up serving higher in North Korea -- at some point -- based on the trajectory of his career,"" said Madden.

Ri Sol Ju, 29, is Kim Jong Un's wife and serves as the ""first lady"" of the rogue country.

Ri Sol Ju is not ""necessarily a powerful lady, but can influence his [Kim Jong Un's] opinion and actions,"" Madden said, adding that the country is ""really positioning her as first lady"" though what her role entails exactly is still evolving, he said.

""She softens his image,"" Madden said.

Ri Sol Ju's father is a commander in North Korea's air force, Madden said, and her marriage to Kim Jong Un was the result of a matchmaking process commissioned by his aunt, Kim Kyong Hui.

Additionally, Ri Sol Ju was once a cheerleader and singer.

Though not related to the Kim family, Choe Ryong Hae, who's reportedly in his late 60s, was promoted to director of the country's organization and guidance department.

The department, according to Madden, is basically a ""glorified human resources agency."" It regulates party members and determines where North Korean citizens work.

Additionally, the department spies on the North Korean population, Madden said.

""His status has always been kind of questionable within the Kim family, and he's had multiple jobs. But he's mild-mannered and a 'yes man,'"" Madden said.

Choe Ryong Hae's father was a defense minister in the 1970s and 1980s, Madden said and was also a member of the same military unit as Kim Jong Il. He reportedly has a good relationship with Madam Kim.

In the 1990s, according to Madden, Choe Ryong Hae disappeared from public view and was accused of corruption for illegally exporting scrap metal to China -- a crime that would have led to his death. But according to Madden, Kim Kyong Hui made a ""desperate appeal to not kill him,"" and Choe Ryong Hae was ultimately spared.

Kim Yong Chol is North Korea's longtime spy chief and a vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party.

Believed to be in his 70s, Kim Yong Chol attended the Winter Games in South Korea where he was seated behind Ivanka Trump during the closing ceremony. The two reportedly did not interact.

He is among a small group of North Korean officials who have accompanied Kim Jong Un to all four of his summits with foreign leaders in recent months -- twice with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and twice with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Before taking up the job responsible for relations with South Korea in 2016, he was a four-star army general and a military intelligence chief who is thought to have been behind a slew of provocations, including two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans and an alleged 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures. Both Seoul and Washington imposed sanctions on him in recent years.

Kim Yong Chol met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York City in May before traveling to meet Trump in the White House on June 1. He brought with him to the meeting with the president a letter from Kim.

Trump said the meeting with Kim Yong Chol was a ""great start.""",765,Fox News,North Korea and Kim Jong Un: Meet the known key players in the regime
"Editor's Note: Jay Nordlinger wrote about Charles Krauthammer and his posthumous collection in the February 25 issue of National Review. Below, he expands that piece, in the style of his Impromptus column.

Charles Krauthammer wrote steadily for almost 40 years -- but he was not a book-writer. He wrote essays, columns, speeches, etc. This is true of other top-rate and influential writers as well. Isaiah Berlin, for one. Irving Kristol, for another. Krauthammer was a good friend of the latter's. And appreciations of both men -- Berlin and Kristol -- appear in a new Krauthammer collection.

* In 2009, I had a long talk with Charles and wrote about him, here. Have a sentence from that piece: ""Sometime in his student career, he read Isaiah Berlin's Four Essays on Liberty, and that, along with John Stuart Mill, gave him something like a foundation.""

Here is another sentence, or a few more:

The late Irving Kristol, father of neoconservatism, famously gave ""two cheers for capitalism."" How about Krauthammer? He admires Kristol no end, and has much in common with him. But he will go as high as ""2.8 cheers"" -- impressive for someone who once supported LBJ's Great Society.

* The just-published collection has a predecessor, Things That Matter. It was published in 2013. The new one, Krauthammer compiled with his son, Daniel. It's called ""The Point of It All."" I think of a title from Amos Elon: ""The Pity of It All."" This is a sadder title, to be sure. (The subtitle of that book is ""A Portrait of Jews in Germany, 1743-1933."")

The Point of It All is very wide-ranging, a true Krauthammer sampler. This is Krauthammer in full, or very nearly so. It is a book that says, ""This is what he believed. This is who he was."" As such, it is invaluable.

* A major topic of this book is politics, as you would expect. Krauthammer lived and worked in Washington, D.C., his entire career. He hammered the government, as everyone does, but he did not despise it, or politics. On the contrary. Listen to him on Meg Greenfield, his editor at the Washington Post: ""She had great respect for what Washington does: weigh deep and often ancient arguments and try from that to fashion action. She had respect for the difficulty of this Sisyphean task and for the fallibility of the men and women engaged in it.""

He could have said the same of himself, too.

* Something I wrote above reminded me of pronunciation. It was the word ""hammered."" At the outset of a podcast I once did with Charles, I said, ""How do you pronounce your last name? 'Krauthahmer' or 'Krauthammer'"" (to rhyme with ""glamor"")? He said the latter: like hammering a nail.

* A word -- a further word -- about D.C. politics, or the broad world of Washington. One day, Dick Cheney hosted a bunch of conservative journalists at his home, the official vice-presidential residence. When he noticed Charles -- I don't think Cheney knew he would be there -- he bowed slightly and said, ""I'm honored.""

* In his introduction to The Point of It All, Daniel Krauthammer writes that ""the core political focus of this book is on the nature and the future of liberal democracy and limited government."" His father called liberal democracy ""the most free, most humane, most decent political system ever invented by man."" It has foes on all sides, needless to say. Last year, Viktor Orb√°n, the Hungarian leader, declared, ""The era of liberal democracy is over."" Is it? There are always new chapters to be written, dark and light.

* Over the years, Krauthammer wrote a lot about foreign policy, and this collection reflects that. ""Putin's irredentist grievances go very deep,"" he wrote in 2014. ""Obama seems unable to fathom them."" Three years later, he was worrying about the Right and its ""attraction to Putinism.""

* About the Middle East, he wrote regularly, always keeping an eye on it. One day, he had a column about Israel -- another one. I sent him a note, saying, ""Charles, I find that I can barely write about the Arab-Israeli conflict anymore, so weary am I from doing it, year after year, decade after decade. I'm glad you're not weary -- or that you push through it, to say the necessary, again."" He replied, ""I know exactly of your weariness. My reluctance to write about it once again is enormous. It's only a sense of duty -- and the shocking realization of how few are prepared to say the obvious truth anymore -- that makes me do it.""

* Norman Podhoretz believes that George W. Bush will turn out like Truman: scorned during his presidency and immediately after, and appreciated later. Krauthammer believes the same thing, as you will see in this collection. About Barack Obama, he writes almost bitterly (which is rare for him) -- because Obama, in Krauthammer's estimation, inherited victory in Iraq (agonizingly achieved) and threw it away.

* Krauthammer is a great explainer of, and believer in, deterrence. This is clear in his writings about NATO, for example. You have to commit to Article 5, he says. (This is the plank of the North Atlantic Treaty that says an attack on one is an attack on all.) If you don't, you have undermined deterrence -- and thus invited aggression, the very thing you want to prevent.

In 2017, he made a controversial statement, and utterly characteristic:

Some claim that putting America first is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it is the antithesis. It makes America no different from all the other countries that define themselves by a particularist blood-and-soil nationalism. What made America exceptional, unique in the world, was defining its own national interest beyond its narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies.

Them's fighting words -- but Krauthammer did not shrink from a fight, when the topic mattered. He was princely in manners, but no violet.

* He could write on matters foreign and domestic. Even extraterrestrial. (Krauthammer had an abiding interest in space. It was one of his few interests I did not share. Chess was another.) Krauthammer was besotted with America, and pushed assimilation, hard. He wanted the New World to be different from the Old. ""Without ever having thought it through,"" he lamented, ""we are engaged in unmaking the American union and encouraging the very tribalism that is the bane of the modern world.""

He did not write those words in recent years, but rather in 1990.

* I'm reminded of something. Let me give you a little biography (his). The below is from that 2009 piece I wrote about him:

Krauthammer was born in 1950, in New York City. But, when he was six, his family moved to Montreal, where he grew up. He later realized that he could not stay in Quebec, to make his career. The reason was this: He thought he would like to have a role in public life -- maybe something in government. And, to be blunt about it, Quebec was no place for a Jew with that kind of ambition. Its political culture was more like that of Europe than like that of English Canada or America. A Jew was always an outsider, or even an ""alien"" element. Besides which, Quebec's politics were consumed with one issue: separatism, independence. To Krauthammer, this was ""one of the most trivial issues on the planet,"" and certainly not one to spend a life or career on. Krauthammer retains a deep general admiration for Canada, whatever its flaws and annoyances.

* More on Krauthammer's versatility. In 2015, he had a column I did not quite expect. It was on food fads, and it was a delight. (Informative too.) I wrote to thank him for it. He said, ""I had great fun writing it."" He added that he did not have space to address the question of salt: Experts had decided that you could actually consume more of it, no problem.

* All politics and no play makes Jack, or Charles, a dull boy. The Point of It All has columns about chess -- a game that Krauthammer played well. (One of his opponents was Natan Sharansky, another good player.) In addition, the book has a column or two about baseball, which Krauthammer loved (as does his fellow conservative columnist at the Washington Post, George Will).

One night, I was doing a Q&A with Krauthammer in front of an audience. I noted that baseball diamonds were being grassed over for soccer. ""Tell me,"" I said. ""Is soccer evil?"" ""Yes,"" Charles answered -- with perfect dryness. Then he expounded. Not the least of his traits was humor, part of the pleasure he took in life, and caused others to share.

The collection includes a terrific column on fandom -- the phenomenon of being a sports fan. He is writing about baseball in particular when he says, ""... what possible stake do grown men have in the fortunes of 25 perfect strangers, vagabond mercenaries paid obscene sums to play a game for half the year?""

Yeah, I know.

So, Krauthammer has his enthusiasms. One of the best collections I know is called, in fact, ""Enthusiasms."" It is by Bernard Levin, the British journalist, and it was published in 1983. The book has chapters on cities, walking, Shakespeare, music, and more.

Would you like to know whom the book is dedicated to? Arianna Stassinopoulos, now Huffington. (I asked her once, ""How does it feel to be the dedicatee of such a great book?"" It felt good.)

* In 1993, Krauthammer addressed the graduating class of McGill University (his alma mater). That address is included in the new collection. It is wonderful. It gives three pieces of advice:

No. 1: ""Don't lose your head. I'm speaking here of intellectual fashion ...""

No. 2: ""Look outward. By that I mean: Don't look inward too much.""

No. 3: ""Save the best. Conserving what's best in the past is, well, conservative advice. It was the advice of G. K. Chesterton, who defined tradition as the democracy of the dead. Tradition is the ultimate democracy because it extends the franchise to generations past and benefits from their hard-earned wisdom.""

Yup.

* The Point of It All has one new piece -- a longish, important one, never before published. Written in the summer of 2017, just before the author had to stop writing, it's called ""The Authoritarian Temptation."" The title is an echo of Jean-Fran√ßois Revel's book of 1976: The Totalitarian Temptation. ""The slide back away from liberal democracy is well underway,"" Krauthammer writes. He cites Turkey, Venezuela, Hungary, Poland, others. (Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, has taken to speaking of ""Authoritarian International,"" a term that plays on the old ""Communist International,"" or ""Comintern."") People are fed up with ""parliamentary dysfunction,"" writes Krauthammer, and are gravitating to ""strongman rule.""

This piece may be construed as a warning, a word to the wise from a wise man, who had absorbed history and was attuned to the world around him.

* In 2009, he wrote, ""Longevity for a columnist is a simple proposition: Once you start, you don't stop. You do it until you die or can no longer put a sentence together."" He never stopped being able to put a sentence together. His writing was as good as his thinking (an amazing equality). After an extended illness, he died in June 2018.

* He started writing in the early 1980s. I was in college -- and read him in all his venues: The New Republic, Time, and the Post. He had a great impact on me. I never stopped reading him. When he wrote something, we conservatives could wave it around and say, ""See? See? This is what we mean, and beautifully expressed."" We could do that with our other biggies too, including Buckley, Podhoretz, Will, and Sowell.

* I'll tell you a story you might like. In 1995, President Clinton gave a speech that vexed me (more than most of his speeches did). I was hoping that Krauthammer would respond, in his Friday column. I waited for that day. And when it arrived, I bought the Washington Post, and, lo, Krauthammer had.

I had to drive to work -- but I didn't want to wait till I got there to read the column. I read it on the way, at stoplights and maybe a little in between.

Immediately, I wrote Krauthammer a letter to thank him for his column. (I did not know him, personally, at the time, incidentally.) I told him how I had read it. ""Thank you,"" he answered. ""But next time: stoplights only, please.""

* Now, let me tell you a secret. I didn't want to read the new collection. I was asked to review it. I felt Krauthammer'd out. But when I started reading, I could not put the book down. I had read all the pieces when they were first published -- or most of them -- but I wanted to reread them. It was wonderful to be in the author's company again. And I thought, ""Yes. This is what I believe. This is the conservatism that I embraced all those years ago, and believed to be true.""

Reading Charles, I had the sensation of reading an old conservatism, even if it is recently ""old."" You could even call it a paleoconservatism.

* I once quoted to him something that Bill Buckley said about Paul Johnson (in his introduction to an anthology, The Quotable Paul Johnson): Johnson is so routinely excellent, it's possible to take him for granted. But one shouldn't. Krauthammer is routinely excellent too -- and not to be taken for granted.

* A young writer -- or an old one, or any in between -- can find a good example in Krauthammer. Here he is in a 2013 interview: ""You're betraying your whole life if you don't say what you think -- and you don't say it honestly and bluntly."" Here he is in a 2017 email (to me): ""I must admit that when I write these days I have the feeling that everything I say is so perfectly obvious that there's no need to write it. Except that these days, that's all the more reason to write it.""

Writing the obvious is an underappreciated act -- because the obvious is not apparent to all, ever.

* Back to Isaiah Berlin, and the Four Essays on Liberty. Krauthammer read them when he was in college. And when Berlin died in 1997, Krauthammer wrote, ""Four Essays is available everywhere. Buy it. Make your children read it before they go to college. . . . And keep one copy at home."" I say the same of The Point of It All.

I intend to refer to it for many years to come -- going to the index and asking, ""What did Charles have to say about this? Anything?"" (The answer will probably be yes.) Journalism is ephemeral, by nature. ""It's fish wrap by Friday,"" goes an old saying. Rick Brookhiser once pointed out to me that the very word ""day"" is in journalism (jour). It's meant to last a day.

This makes me all the more grateful for, and delighted with, The Point of It All. It is Charles bundled up -- a permanent, portable Charles. In addition to being a stellar book, it is a great service.",766,nationalreview.com,Reflections on Charles Krauthammer
"We are living through a historic turning point in American politics. For 50 years, this country was run by an establishment policy agenda shared by both parties, in favor of globalization, automation, uncontrolled immigration and the centralization of government and the economy. In 2016 that consensus was overthrown in the populist revolution led, of course, by Donald Trump on the right, but also Bernie Sanders on the left, which paved the way to what we see today: the Democrats' lurch to the populist left.

That's dangerous for America because the more we see of these new loony left policies, the clearer it is that they'd bring disaster for our economy and society. But it's a danger for Republicans, too, because unless they develop a positive populist agenda of their own, they'll be swept away.

That's because on issue after issue, the populist left is responding to people's real concerns. Americans are right to be angry about inequality. If you're part of the globally-connected knowledge economy elite, your wealth has soared over the last few decades. But for most working Americans, incomes have been flat or falling since the 1970s.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON.

Worse, many millions of responsible Americans who work hard still find themselves in a permanent and precarious state of economic insecurity. For example, a recent Federal Reserve study found that 40 percent of Americans could not afford a $400 emergency expense, like an unexpected medical bill.

In response, AOC's Green New Deal, now backed by most leading Democrat presidential candidates, promises high-paying federal jobs to anybody who wants one. Cory Booker has actually introduced a job guarantee bill, claiming it ""would give all Americans a shot at a day's work and, by introducing competition into the labor market, raise wages and improve benefits for all workers.""

But the paper that his plan drew from estimated that the total annual cost of a federal jobs guarantee to be over $500 billion! It's obvious who'd end up paying for it - the taxpayer. Which, of course, is all part of the plan for the loony left populists.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Presidential candidate Julian Castro wants to revoke the Trump tax cuts. And Elizabeth Warren is planning a new wealth tax. ""We need structural change,"" she says. ""That's why I'm proposing an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans.""

But these taxes are not structural change. They're punitive, not positive.

High taxes would actually hurt working Americans by cutting investment, leading to lower growth and fewer jobs. Wealth taxes make the rich poorer; they don't make the poor richer.

But here's the key political point: Republicans can't just scream ""Venezuela!"" about all this loony leftism. You need a positive populist alternative to give working Americans economic security. So, instead of higher taxes on the rich, how about lower taxes on workers? Slash payroll taxes and institute a real living wage. It doesn't make any sense that the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in almost 10 years when the cost of living has only continued to rise.

But in a broader sense, what the left's version of populism gets wrong about inequality and poverty is the superficial way they approach it. Their plans target the symptoms of poverty. We should be aiming at the underlying causes. And one of the biggest is family breakdown.

Census data shows that children living with a divorced single parent are 50 percent more likely to be living below the poverty line, compared to children from two-parent homes. Another study showed that ""the fraction of children living in single-parent households is the strongest negative correlate of upward income mobility.""

The left lectures us all the time about believing the science on climate change. Well, it's time they stopped denying the science on family. A child starts life at a steep disadvantage if they come from a broken family. The neighborhood they live in, the schools they attend, even the food they eat - these are all factors that impact childhood development and are affected by household income, which plunges if a family breaks up - or never gets together in the first place.

Here's what the populist left gets wrong about inequality. Americans understand that inequality is the price you pay for opportunity. And they're prepared to pay that price, as long as everyone has access to opportunity. But the reason Americans are so angry right now is that the ladder of opportunity has been broken. Conservative populists need to put the rungs back on that ladder to reboot social mobility.

That means helping families come together and stay together. But, of course, it also means fixing education. In too many parts of the country, our schools are blocking opportunity instead of building it.

Figures from 2016 show that in one-third of Baltimore's public high schools, not a single student scored ""proficient"" on the state's math exam -- not a single one. Another study found that in Chicago, one in four African-American students attends a subpar school. Of course, there are many excellent public schools in America. But they're typically the ones serving neighborhoods where families are already doing well.

A Stanford study found that the gap in standardized test scores between affluent and low-income students had grown by about 40 percent between 1960 and 2007. The proven answer to this is to help children escape failing schools by giving their parents real choice. Of course, the public sector unions hate that, because it's a threat to their power. But instead of backing opportunity, the loony left populists back the unions who block it.

Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and others are falling over themselves to suck up to their big union donors. What a bunch of hypocrites they are. Railing against the rich and then doubling down on the very system that perpetuates inequality in America - the public sector education monopoly.

The reason Americans are so angry right now is that the ladder of opportunity has been broken. Conservative populists need to put the rungs back on that ladder to reboot social mobility.

Radical school choice should be the next big crusade for conservative populists. And it's one that has the advantage of being truly popular, with 73 percent support among Latinos, 68 percent among whites and nearly the same with African-Americans.

But our education system blocks opportunity beyond high school. And once again, left wing populists have exactly the wrong answer. Bernie Sanders touts free college tuition as every American's ""right."" No, I think the word you're looking for, Bernie, is ""wrong."" It's wrong to force every young American, at taxpayer expense, into a cookie-cutter four-year college program, ending in a useless degree that won't lead to a job, but will land them with crippling debt.

The unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds is over twice the national average. And student loan borrowers owe close to $1.5 trillion. But the left wing populists strike a chord when they focus on this issue. So, conservative populists need a positive answer.

It's time for a radical rethink of the whole system. Make it much more open and flexible. Help students focus on their individual strengths. Often that might be a blue-collar career - ""the jobs that make civilized life possible,"" as my guest Mike Rowe put it a few weeks ago.

Give every American the opportunity to thrive in the economy of the future with ongoing, affordable access to skills training from the private sector. Build on the great start made by Invanka Trump and her National Council for the American Worker.

On jobs, on schools, on family - we've seen a decades-long collapse in opportunity. Yes, things have started to turn around, and that's great. But a half century of establishment rule brought deep problems for working Americans, and the appeal of socialism is no surprise when capitalism failed for so many.

That's why it is a huge risk for Republicans to just sit back and hope the loony left populists simply self-destruct. The establishment - it's dead. America's not going back to the corrupt and incompetent Never Trumpers and their swampy counterparts in the Democratic party.

The future is populist. But the question is what kind? The negative, vindictive, top-down centralizing authoritarianism of the left or a positive, people power version of populism on the right -- pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community.",767,Fox News,Steve Hilton: Republicans must not sit back and wait for the loony left to self-destruct
"HANOI, Vietnam - Children at a kindergarten in Hanoi, some in Korean traditional ""Hanbok"" dress, have been practicing singing and dancing, hoping to show off their talents to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when he comes to town this week for his second summit with President Donald Trump.

Elsewhere in the Vietnam-Korea Friendship Kindergarten, students have been assembling picture montages on maps of Vietnam and the Koreas. In another classroom, children were coloring in Vietnamese and North Korean flags with which they hope to greet Kim.

""We really want for Mr. Kim Jong Un, the great leader of the Korean people, to visit our school,"" said Ngo Thi Minh Ha, the school's rector.

Apple-cheeked youngsters in traditional national garb meeting a paternal leader is a mainstay of old-style communist iconography, and North Korea is the closest thing left to an old-style communist state.

But the ties that once bound Vietnam to North Korea in their fight against the U.S. have long since frayed. These days, South Korea is the Korea most Vietnamese look to, as evidenced by Vietnam's many billboards for the goods and services of companies such as Samsung, Lotte and Hyundai, and the massive amount of trade and investment coming from Seoul.

The kindergarten, however, swims against the tide of history. It was built in 1978, three years after the end of the Vietnam War, a gift from the North Korean government, which also supplied it with toys, musical instruments, tables, chairs and cookware, according to Hoang Thi Thanh, the school's rector from 2002 to 2013.

The school initially had just four classrooms accommodating 120 children, but according to Thanh, ""I was very happy and proud to be one of the first teachers of the school, because it was probably the most beautiful school in Hanoi at that time.""

It's now a three-story complex with a large courtyard and a student body of 470 in a busy residential neighborhood with run-down, 1970s-era apartment buildings.

The students learn about North Korea, its leaders, landmarks and culture, lessons that are supplemented by a sister relationship with a kindergarten in Pyongyang with which visits are exchanged each year.

According to Thanh, there was a political hiccup in 2010, when the North Korean government proposed to rename the school after Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founding father. Vietnam, whose ruling communist party has always favored collective leadership over personalized rule, demurred. A compromise was reached in which two classrooms were named after Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il -- the grandfather and father, respectively, of Kim Jong Un -- while a kindergarten classroom in Pyongyang was named after Vietnamese revolutionary hero Ho Chi Minh.

Ha, the rector, hopes Kim and Trump can achieve an agreement, and echoes the common sentiment that maybe Vietnam has something to teach North Korea, saying she hopes ""the Korean people will enjoy peace and like the Vietnamese people, the Korean nation will embark on a reform process for development and prosperity.""

For local parents, however, education rather than politics is the main concern.

"Vatican watcher: Francis' Abuse-Summit Speech Flopped

""Pope Francis' concluding address"" at this month's Vatican summit on clerical abuse ""did not present a detailed, coherent strategy for reform."" So contends Christopher Altieri at The Catholic Herald. He notes that the pontiff's speech didn't even address the church's failures until a dozen paragraphs in. Instead, it cast abuse as ""a widespread phenomenon in all cultures."" Fair enough, says Altieri, ""but the reason the patriarchs, presidents of bishops' conferences, religious superiors and curial heads were here is because of the crisis of clerical sexual abuse of minors."" As it is, ""one could be forgiven for garnering the impression Francis wants to skip the part where the Church reforms herself."" As for whether the wider summit will produce the ""concrete, effective"" action the pope called for, that ""will come in the follow-through,"" says Altieri.

Foreign desk: Trump Steps Back From Disaster in Syria

President Trump last Thursday suddenly changed his Syria policy -- ""for the better,"" suggests The Washington Post's Josh Rogin. By agreeing to leave at least 200 US troops there, he signaled that ""a post-caliphate strategy is emerging to make sure that the Islamic State doesn't return, that the Turks don't slaughter the Kurds and that Iran doesn't take over the entire country."" Credit Sen. Lindsey Graham, who spelled out to Trump the risks if he ""cuts and runs from Syria (he would own the disaster) vs. the benefits if he finds a way to get Europe to share the burden (he would avoid the ¬≠disaster)."" So the next step ""is to go back to European countries and ask them to up their troop commitments."" The ball, says Rogin ""is in Europe's court.""

Conservative: Reparations Are Mere Symbolism

Democratic presidential candidates are battling ""not only to out-radical one another"" but also to ""out-radical Bernie Sanders' 2016 performance, on the theory that it did not establish the outermost bound of politically potent left-wing radicalism,"" notes National Review's Kevin Williamson. Now Sen. Liz Warren has endorsed paying reparations to African-Americans, a position also held by Sen. Kamala Harris, ""but forsworn by other Democrats, ¬≠Barack Obama notable among them."" As evil as slavery was -- and its consequences ""remain very much with us"" -- reparations ""are the wrong way"" to mitigate it. But then, reparations ""are not intended to mitigate that evil."" Rather, they are intended to make Warren, Harris or ""some other tedious mediocrity"" president. And they would ""lead to an even uglier and bitterer species of racial politics than the one we already have.""

Political scribe: The Never Trumper's Dilemma

The ""most zealous"" Never Trump Republicans, led by former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, are cooking up various schemes to challenge President Trump in the 2020 GOP primaries, reports The Washington ¬≠Examiner's Byron York. Already facing an uphill battle, owing to the president's incumbency advantage, the Never Trumpers now face a new ¬≠dilemma: ""A primary challenge could weaken Trump and ensure the election of a Democrat,"" at a time when the Democratic Party has lurched to the hard left. This could mean that the ""work of Never Trump conservatives ensures the election of a radical candidate on a platform of the Green New Deal, tax rates above 70 percent, universal health care, free college, even more liberal abortion policies and more."" Not that the prospect will deter the Never Trump crowd, ""long committed to 'disposing of' Trump,'‚Ää"" as Kristol has put it.

From the left: Smollett Case and Our Confirmation Bias

The Week's Joel Mathis says he initially wanted to believe Jussie Smollett, even as he ""also suspected he was lying"" -- because ""his story was too perfect."" By which Mathis means ""it precisely fit my own expectations of what life is like in America under President Trump, right down to the detail about the attackers reportedly shouting that this is 'MAGA Country.' "" Indeed, it seemed to have been ""designed in a lab to produce a storm of lefty righteous indignation, and that's exactly what happened."" Which only shows that ""confirmation bias"" is real: ""We all think we are rational creatures, but the truth is that most of us believe evidence that confirms our beliefs -- and filter out contradictory facts,"" when ""maybe the best thing to do is exercise a little caution.""",769,New York Post,The pope's abuse-summit speech was a flop and other commentary

"A publishing company out of Chicago is set to turn socialist star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) into a comic book superhero ""kicking"" Republican butt, the company says.

A Friday press release from Chicago-based Devil's Due Comics depicts the Green New Deal writer and newly elected New York Congresswoman in a white pants suit standing astride a fallen red elephant while a sheepish and worried blue Democrat donkey stands in the background saying, ""gulp.""

""New Party, Who Dis?"" the comic book cover adds under a title screaming ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force.""

""It's ‚ÄØAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the 'Freshman Force' of Congress vs. the establishment in this all-new commemorative comic,"" Devil's Due announced.

""Comic creators converge to celebrate the election of the most diverse group of freshman congresspersons in history, and spare no-one in this satire that takes aim at Washington,"" the company added.

The ""Who dis"" title is derived from one of the congresswoman's tweets taking to task former Democrat U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman who said she is not the future of the Democrat Party. The former Connecticut Sen. was heard dissing the newly minted Congresswoman in a recent interview and in response to Lieberman's proclamation, AOC tweeted ""who dis"" to the one-time Democrat nominee for Vice President who retired from the Senate in 2013.

In the press release, publisher Josh Blaylock claimed that his AOC cartoon character would ""engage in a series of super-heroic mini-adventures, taking on the GOP establishment from within.""

""To boot, this anthology comic satirically skewers everyone from President Trump to his near-endless team of morally-compromised Republican cronies,"" Blaylock continued.

The comic aims to ""create something that celebrates the fresh new energy and diversity of the stagnated legislative body, and help some good causes at the same time,"" Blaylock said.

Blaylock also insisted that AOC is the ""unofficial leader of the new school"" and that his comic will celebrate the ""common excitement for the breath of fresh air the new Congress brings.""

Devil's Due comics has dipped into left-wing politics before when ten years ago it published a series entitled ""Barack the Barbarian"" in which President Barack Obama was depicted as a he-man destroying all opposition. It is an interesting juxtaposition for the president scoffed at in real life for his mom jeans and his effete, Kale-eating style.

"Making the case that actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated a fake attack on himself, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Jackson said that, as a black man, ""I know the racial divide that exists here.""

But after alleging that Smollett, who is black and gay, ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Jackson added, ""I'm left hanging my head and asking, 'Why?' ""

Good question. Why, indeed, would an actor reportedly making $1.8 million a year stoop so low and risk it all?

The short answer is greed; Smollett allegedly wanted a raise.

But assuming that Smollett is not completely off his rocker, there must be more to his thinking, and there is. The added element also explains much of the vicious, anything-goes turmoil roiling our nation: Smollett thought he could get away with it.

And why not? One look around America would tell him that blaming President Trump and his supporters for the worst things imaginable is the fastest way to become a celebrated victim and a hero to half the country.

And victimhood is making some people very, very rich.

Smollett could have correctly concluded that events don't even have to be true to be solid gold. Enough people are willing to believe the worst because, hating Trump with every fiber of their being, they need the worst to be true.

The more serious the charge, the more they fantasize it will be the death knell of his presidency. That makes Trump haters easy prey for con men.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren played on their fantasies when she said the president ""may not even be a free person"" next year. Her words made headlines, not because she has any insider knowledge, but because her claim sent lefty hearts aflutter.

Warren, of course, is a professional con artist of long standing, so expect to see more sleight-of-hand as she seeks the Oval Office.

If police are correct, Smollett played his trick by scripting events designed to activate all the erogenous zones on the political and cultural left. His claim that his ""attackers"" made racist and anti-gay slurs, threatened to lynch him and declared Chicago ""MAGA country,"" was an immediate smash hit with his intended audience.

Overnight he became a household name as Hollywood and Democrats -- excuse the repetition -- embraced his story without a shred of doubt. See, see, they said, that's Trump's America for you.

Their enthusiasm reflected their self-interest. Smollett's story was tailored to fit all the corners of the narrative they've been selling since Trump came down the escalator in June 2015 to announce his candidacy. Smollett played the Trump haters like a Stradivarius.

He got bonus points for being the right kind of victim but the clumsy plot outlined by cops shows he lacks the gravitas of more experienced cons. Take Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who is turning a disgraceful career-ending episode into a major pay day.

McCabe, after failing to bring down Trump, got fired for lying under oath -- but now gets the star treatment on a book tour. What Trump-hating lefty wouldn't want a piece of that action?

Perhaps Smollett fantasized he could get rich like McCabe or suddenly become a giant media star like James Comey. The former head of the FBI, Comey tarnished the bureau's legacy for a generation, then painted himself as a victim of Trump and helped to spur the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

For his efforts, which included a book and coming out of the closet as an anti-Trump partisan, Comey became a millionaire several times over.

Of course, Comey and McCabe didn't exist in a vacuum. They were part of an administration that weaponized law enforcement and intelligence to boost their preferred candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, and destroy Trump.

Seeing how they basically got caught and still got rich, Smollett might have decided that, no matter what, he'd be rewarded, much as former top officials James Clapper and John Brennan got TV contracts after clearly abusing their official powers to play politics.

As for Clinton herself, she lost an election she should have won in a cakewalk -- yet managed to launch the lie that Trump stole victory. Her lie remains an article of faith among deluded millions who believe it because they want it to be true.

But Smollett's scheme would have made no sense unless he could count on the complete cooperation of one other player: the media. He would need them to swallow his story, then amplify it and repeat it a thousand times over.

Naturally, they did, because they, too, desperately wanted it to be true.

He hand-picked his interviewers, and played the role of his life -- a defiant victim of Trump Nation. Smollett aimed to be so good and so appealing that he wouldn't just get a raise, he'd be a mega-star and his career would take off like a rocket.

He might even have gotten a call for a starring role in Sunday's Oscar telecast. Imagine the Hollywood elites, comfortable in their sneering disdain for Trump's America, rising to applaud him as he appeared on stage as a stand-in for their America.

The world would watch movie stars cry real tears of admiration and sympathy. Smollett would bask in their salute, a bold, strong member of the resistance. Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.

Endlessly creative in distorting the truth of the new federal tax law, Gov. Cuomo now says Trump ""gave an unseemly tax cut to corporations and the rich and he financed it by raising taxes on primarily Democratic states through the elimination of SALT"" or state and local taxes.

In fact, the law does not eliminate SALT deductions. It limits them to $10,000 a year, and that provision is why those Americans getting federal tax hikes are mostly the high earners Cuomo claims got a tax cut.

Similarly, Cuomo's goal of reinstating unlimited deductibility would hugely benefit those earning over $500,000 a year.

Meanwhile, he's pushing a regressive tax hike in Manhattan by calling it congestion pricing. The fee of more than $13 a day would hit all drivers, regardless of income, making it a new tax of over $3,000 a year.

Even more galling, that money would go to the MTA to make up for the wild spending Cuomo failed to control.

'Team' fouls

According to my unscientific survey, all politicians now sign fundraising appeals with the word ""team."" As in ""TeamRice"" (Kathleen) and ""TeamMitch"" (McConnell).

Dear Pols, We know your letters are mass produced and that consultants told you the word ""team"" adds a human touch. It doesn't. Please stop.

"Carriage-horse drivers said Saturday that construction work on Central Park's East Drive is paving the way to move the iconic vehicles inside the park -- where tourists who want rides won't be able to find them.

The mayor's plan calls for three pickup and drop-off locations in the park.

Drivers currently park along busy streets surrounding the park, mainly Central Park South.

""We're going to be invisible,"" said Ibrahim Saban, 29, who's been driving for five years and is worried about his livelihood. ""They want us to give up.""

Another driver, who declined to give his name, said he's been in the business for 32 years.

""It's just dirty politics, that's all it is,"" he said. ""The carriages have been here forever ... They just want us out of business.""

Mayor de Blasio's plan would also force the drivers to stop giving rides two hours earlier.

The park shuts at 1 a.m., but the carriages now are allowed to operate until 3 a.m.

The drivers sued, but their two cases were thrown out of court. They've filed a motion to reargue on Friday.

The Department of Transportation acknowledged the work is being done ""to facilitate the new horse-carriage rules,"" adding ""it will have no impact to the roadway configuration.""",773,New York Post,Carriage drivers rip de Blasio plan: 'We're going to be invisible'
"The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) gave the upcoming abortion movie Unplanned an R-rating Friday, citing ""some disturbing, bloody images."" But the movie's filmmakers fear the rating is motivated by politics.

""We made a pro-life movie in a pro-choice town"" said Chuck Konzelman, who along with Cary Solomon wrote and directed Unplanned.

For Solomon, the R-rating smacks of hypocrisy. ""The standard used to rate our movie is being applied inconsistently as it relates to bloody images on-screen,"" he told me in a phone interview. ""In fact, Happy Death Day 2U (a ""slasher"" film with several violent murder scenes) has far more blood and gore than our film and it received a PG-13 rating.""

Indeed, most R-rated films are labelled as such for featuring sexual scenes, profanity, nudity, or violence -- all of which Unplanned has none. The filmmakers had hoped for a PG-13 rating.

The film tells the true-life story of former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson, who left the abortion giant in 2009 to become a pro-life activist.

The filmmakers told me their movie depicts scenes of Johnson, played by actress Ashley Bratcher, bleeding and vomiting on the floor after taking an abortion pill. The MPAA also objected to scenes showing a doctor looking at images of a fetus after an abortion.

The MPAA told Konzelman and Solomon to either cut the abortion scenes or edit them. ""The blood is in no way gratuitous,"" Konzelman told me. ""For us to not include blood in these critical scenes would be to severely cheapen this true story.""

""We have three scenes in the film which directly address abortion, and the MPAA objected to all three,"" Solomon said. ""They specifically made mention of objection to grainy, black and white sonogram images that were part of one of the scenes. It was clear that any meaningful treatment of the issue was going to be objectionable.""

An MPAA spokesperson said that the film's distributor, Pure Flix -- the studio behind God's Not Dead -- didn't respond to the organization's appeals process in a timely manner. Pure Flix president Michael Scott fired back saying, ""This story needs to be told and the message needed to be delivered.""

""It is our calling as Christians to tell the story about the moral implications of abortion that the mainstream media refuses to acknowledge,"" Scott said.

Pure Flix is charging ahead and plan to release Unplanned with its R-rating.

""Most Americans believe Hollywood's God is money. No. Their God is a liberal agenda that they serve without fail. And we are anathema to that, Solomon said.",774,Breitbart,Exclusive -- 'Unplanned' Filmmakers Explain Surprise R-Rating: 'We Made a Pro-Life Movie in a Pro-Choice Town'
